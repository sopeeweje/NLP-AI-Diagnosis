"Creating an artificial intelligence therapy-to-data feedback loop for child developmental healthcare Project Summary There is a sharp and increasing imbalance between the number of children with autism in need of care and the availability of specialists certified to treat the disorder in its multi-faceted manifestations. The autism community faces a dual clinical challenge: how to direct scarce specialist resources to service the diverse array of phenomes and how to monitor and validate best practices in treatment. Clinicians must now look to solutions that scale in a decentralized fashion, placing data capture, remote monitoring, and therapy increasingly into the hands of families. Using artificial intelligence (AI) and large amounts of labeled human emotion computer vision data, we have developed a solution for automatic facial expression recognition that runs on Google Glasses and Android smartphones to deliver real time social cues to individuals with autism in the child’s natural environment. We hypothesize that this informatic system can provide real-time therapy in a way that scales to meet the demand of the growing population of autism families, including underserved minorities, while growing data that can be used to measure progress over time and in the development of novel AI. Our first aim will focus on the development of a deep learning model that enables dynamic emotion recognition in the real world, and on domain adaptation procedures that enable minimal manual labeling to personalize the model for optimal accuracy on the individuals with whom the child will interact most regularly at home. Our second aim will focus on the human computer interface, namely the design of the user experience with the Android application that controls the sessions run on the Google Glass wearable. We will work our clinical colleagues and with groups of autism families to develop and enhance a set of games and activity modes that create social engagements ideal for emotion therapy, including an emotion capture and a charades game. The third aim will test our central hypothesis that the Glass system can create a therapy-to-data feedback loop that delivers clinical care while growing data for measurement and model development. We will work with up to 200 children ages 4-8 who have recent autism diagnoses and do not have access to standard behavioral therapy. We will build a community of autism families through crowdsourcing techniques, befitting the mobile paradigm embodied by our work, and through close collaboration with behavioral therapy providers, the autism outreach organization Autism Speaks, and the digital healthcare company, Cognoa. The families will work with us on design and refinement of our “Superpower Glass” system for fit, engagement, and function of use for both therapy and data capture. Importantly, we will send units home with families to use the device for at least 3 twenty-minute sessions per week for a minimum of 6 weeks. This remote period will generate a massive database to quantify overall social learning, emotion comprehension, eye contact, and sustained social acuity. In all, our work program will show that mobile wearable AI can bring the social learning process out of the clinic and into the real world for faster and more adaptive intervention. Project Narrative There is a sharp and growing imbalance between the number of clinical care providers available and the number of children with an autism diagnosis that leave most children without therapy until after critical periods in development have passed. We intend to address this problem through creation of a machine learning-enabled wearable that brings effective care to the home and empowers both parents, patients, and clinicians with mobile solutions that personalize care delivery to dramatically improve children’s outcomes. The Superpower Glass system, which delivers social cues to children during real-time interactions and provides several engagement modes for families, is a promising solution that enables greater access to care for families across the US, and potentially, across the globe.!",Creating an artificial intelligence therapy-to-data feedback loop for child developmental healthcare,9716320,R01LM013083,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Android', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Car Phone', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Child', 'Child Support', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Control Groups', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decentralization', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Expression Recognition', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Secure', 'Self-Direction', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Social Interaction', 'Socialization', 'Specialist', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'User-Computer Interface', 'Variant', 'Waiting Lists', 'Work', 'adaptive intervention', 'applied behavior analysis', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'care delivery', 'care providers', 'clinical care', 'combat', 'critical period', 'crowdsourcing', 'deep learning', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'improved', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'model development', 'novel', 'outreach', 'personalized care', 'phenome', 'practical application', 'programs', 'prototype', 'skills', 'smartphone Application', 'social', 'social engagement', 'social learning', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'underserved minority', 'user-friendly']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,677664,-0.0013471044967169423
"Using Machine Learning to Predict Clinical Deterioration in Hospitalized Children PROJECT SUMMARY Children who are admitted to the hospital and experience deterioration have a high risk of mortality and poor long-term health. Current warning early scores indicating risk of deterioration are subjectively derived and have not reduced in-hospital mortality. In recent work, I developed a vital sign based statistical model that demonstrated improved accuracy over current risk scores at predicting clinical deterioration in hospitalized children 24 hours in advance. Within adults, the combination of longitudinal data analysis techniques, machine learning, and electronic health record (EHR) data have led to highly accurate early warning scores. Therefore, my aim in this grant proposal is to utilize longitudinal integration of EHR data in a machine learning framework to develop a model for predicting clinical deterioration in hospitalized children as early as possible. I will do this by first deriving and validating a prediction model using structured EHR data collected from three pediatric hospitals (Aim 1). Using the same cohort, I will then build and validate a prediction model using features derived from unstructured clinical notes (Aim 2). I will also compare if the addition of unstructured features improves the prediction accuracy of the model derived in Aim 1. Finally, I will determine the association between non-patient level environmental variables within the hospital ecosystem and risk of clinical deterioration in hospitalized children (Aim 3). I will also determine if the addition of these environmental risk factors improves performance of the prediction model derived through Aims 1 and 2. Completion of this proposal will result in a validated pediatric risk prediction model that will enable clinicians to recognize early signs of deterioration in hospitalized children. This will facilitate timely intervention, thereby saving lives and improving long-term health. In addition, this grant will also provide me with crucial data for a future R01 trial aimed at assessing the impact of the prediction model in reducing mortality, decreasing costs, and improving long-term outcomes in hospitalized children. To establish myself as an independent investigator in pediatric prediction modeling, I propose a training plan that includes comprehensive didactics and mentorship in the areas of longitudinal data analysis, advanced machine learning, natural language processing, and concepts in pediatric care. I have assembled a first-class mentorship team comprised of national experts in longitudinal data analysis techniques and EHR-based machine learning (Robert Gibbons PhD and Matthew Churpek MD, PhD). My advisory team is comprised of experts in natural language processing (Dmitriy Dligach PhD), clinical decision support around deterioration events (Dana Edelson MD, MS and Priti Jani MD), and pediatric early warning scores (Christopher Parshuram MB., ChB., D. Phil., FRACP). By completing my research and career development goals, I will develop into an independent expert investigator in developing pediatric prediction models for ultimately improving outcomes in hospitalized children. PROJECT NARRATIVE Clinical deterioration in hospitalized children is associated with high-risk of mortality as well as complications in their long-term health. An improved prediction model capable of identifying pediatric patients at risk of clinical deterioration as early as possible can facility timely and proper intervention, thereby decreasing preventable death and improving long-term outcomes in hospitalized children.",Using Machine Learning to Predict Clinical Deterioration in Hospitalized Children,9805481,K01HL148390,"['Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Cardiopulmonary', 'Caring', 'Chicago', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Intervention', 'Ecosystem', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitalized Child', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Hylobates Genus', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurological outcome', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Randomized', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Savings', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'career development', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'control trial', 'cost', 'electronic structure', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'pediatric patients', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'preventable death', 'research and development', 'risk prediction model', 'tool', 'trend', 'ward']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,K01,2019,147563,0.07170992007727406
"Mobile bedside ultrasound for the diagnosis of pediatric pneumonia in resource limited settings Project Summary In low and middle-income countries (LMICs) pneumonia is by far the leading cause of death among children < 5 years of age. Despite progress in reducing global pneumonia deaths, pneumonia still kills over 1 million children a year. A key factor is the challenge of pneumonia diagnosis. Chest X-Ray is the gold standard for pneumonia diagnoses but exposes children to ionizing radiation and is mainly restricted to hospital settings. Outside of hospitals, pneumonia is diagnosed based on clinical grounds using the WHO’s Integrated Management of Childhood Illness algorithms. However, that approach lacks specificity, resulting in significant overdiagnosis of pneumonia. That wastes precious resources, exposes children to antibiotics unnecessarily, and delays identification of the true cause of a child’s illness. Recent years have seen an explosion of interest in bedside ultrasound as a radiation-sparing alternative to X- Ray. The accuracy of bedside US for diagnosing pneumonia is comparable to X-Ray. However, traditional bedside US suffers the same limitations as X-Rays in terms of portability, and still requires interpretation of images by a trained radiologist. Recent innovations in ultrasound technology and artificial intelligence applications suggest a possible pathway forward. Bluetooth enabled US transponders that connect to a smart phone or tablet, effectively create a truly portable US suite that can fit into one’s pocket. Similarly, advances in artificial intelligence render possible the automated interpretation of mobile bedside US (mBSUS) images on a smart phone, obviating the need for a radiologist. The twin goals of this project are: 1) to compare the accuracy of the mobile, Bluetooth US system, linked to a cell phone, against the gold standard of Chest X-Ray for diagnosis of pneumonia among children aged 1-59 months; and 2) to apply machine learning algorithms to assist in the identification of accurate classification features that reliably identify lobar pneumonia. If successful, this would be a pivotal first step towards the goal of a truly portable yet still highly accurate approach to the diagnosis of pediatric pneumonia that could function autonomously without the need for external evaluation by a skilled radiologist. Such a tool would revolutionize pneumonia case management in resource limited parts of the world and could save the lives of many. Project Narrative Pneumonia remains the leading cause of death for children <5 years around the world. A key barrier is the lack of affordable and portable imaging systems. In this project, we will 1) test the accuracy of a mobile ultrasound system that connects to a smart phone via blue tooth against the gold standard of chest X-Ray, and 2) use machine learning algorithms to automate the diagnosis of pneumonia, thereby obviating the need for external review by a radiologist.",Mobile bedside ultrasound for the diagnosis of pediatric pneumonia in resource limited settings,9773427,R21TW011343,"['5 year old', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotics', 'Aorta', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blinded', 'Bluetooth', 'Breast Feeding', 'Breathing', 'Case Management', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chest wall structure', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Convulsions', 'Coughing', 'Cyanosis', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Explosion', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Head', 'Heart', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Lethargies', 'Link', 'Liver', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pediatric Radiologist', 'Pleura', 'Pneumococcal Pneumonia', 'Pneumonia', 'Predictive Value', 'Public Health', 'Radiation', 'Regional Anatomy', 'Resources', 'Respiratory Diaphragm', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Teaching Hospitals', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'Tooth structure', 'Training', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Ultrasonography', 'Unconscious State', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vomiting', 'Zambia', 'aged', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'drinking', 'health training', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'low and middle-income countries', 'machine learning algorithm', 'meetings', 'mortality', 'portability', 'radiologist', 'smartphone Application', 'tool', 'wasting']",FIC,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R21,2019,199220,0.07240868631759144
"A DATA SCIENCE APPROACH TO AIR TOXICS AND CHILDREN'S ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PROJECT SUMMARY: This proposal aims to characterize the associations between prenatal exposure to interpretable combinations of air toxics and children’s cognitive health through the efficient use of big public health data. With guidance from multidisciplinary advisors, the candidate will develop skills in data science, machine learning and advanced biostatistics to supplement her training in epidemiologic methods. This will allow her to progress in her career and advance research on combined environmental exposures and children’s health. Previous research has found associations between prenatal exposure to single air pollutants and children’s cognitive health but has lacked the ability to investigate combined impacts of multiple pollutants, including the synergistic/antagonistic interactions between pollutants that have been observed in experimental studies. Understanding the effects of combined exposures is a strategic goal of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, and the field of environmental health is transitioning from single-pollutant approaches to more holistic paradigms, such as the exposome. Identifying associations and interactions within the context of high-dimensional exposure data presents a computational challenge. Methods from domains such as data science, including machine learning methods, can be incorporated into the epidemiologic toolbox for addressing environmental mixtures and multiple exposures. The goal of this Career Development Award is to advance the candidate into an independent research career at the intersection of big data science and children’s environmental health. Through formal coursework, directed learning and field rotations, the candidate will gain skills in data science, machine learning and advanced biostatistics. Mentors, advisors and consultants have been selected for their complementary expertise, relevant research experience and mentoring abilities. The proposed research will leverage the skills gained from the training plan and apply them to characterize associations between prenatal exposure to interpretable combinations of air toxics and 3rd grade standardized test scores, a school-based measure of cognitive outcomes. Residence at birth will be used to link data on air toxics, a subset of air pollutants, to an administrative data linkage of public health registries and education data for approximately 220,000 children born in New York City from 1994-1998. The candidate will develop and validate a two-stage approach of hypotheses generation followed by targeted analyses in order to identify combinations of air toxics associated with children’s test scores within the context of high-dimensional exposure data (Aim 1). Targeted analyses using well-established epidemiologic methods for effect estimation and assessment of interaction between air toxics will be performed. (Aim2) Potential mediators of the relationship between air toxics and test scores can then be identified using statistical mediation and data science approaches. (Aim 3) Completion of these aims will uniquely position the candidate to conduct future research on combined environmental exposures and children’s health. PROJECT NARRATIVE Epidemiologic studies have shown that prenatal and/or early-life exposures to ambient air pollutants are associated with multiple measures of neurodevelopment and cognition in childhood. However, most of the previous studies characterized exposure using a single pollutant, even though ambient air is a complex mixture. This study will identify the combined effects of prenatal exposure to multiple air pollutants on children's standardized test scores within a large, representative population of urban children.",A DATA SCIENCE APPROACH TO AIR TOXICS AND CHILDREN'S ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH,9791316,R00ES027022,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Air Pollutants', 'Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Monitoring', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Linkages', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development Plans', 'Distal', 'Education', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Information Systems', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'New York City', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Rotation', 'Schools', 'Selection Bias', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Technical Expertise', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Urban Population', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'early life exposure', 'epidemiological model', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'genome wide association study', 'health data', 'high dimensionality', 'learning strategy', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurodevelopment', 'pollutant', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'random forest', 'research and development', 'residence', 'skills', 'third grade', 'urban children']",NIEHS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R00,2019,246653,0.04501189797897044
"Automatic Rib Fracture Detection in Pediatric Radiography to Identify Non-Accidental Trauma ABSTRACT Automatic Rib Fracture Detection in Pediatric Radiography to Identify Non-Accidental Trauma PI: Adam M. Alessio Non-accidental trauma caused by physical abuse is a leading cause of death in children in the United States. Because rib fractures are highly predictive of child abuse and chest radiographs are commonly performed for multiple indications, pediatric chest radiographs can have a critical role in the identification of abuse. Detection of rib fractures on pediatric radiographs is challenging and a high percentage of fractures are missed, particularly in imaging centers with limited pediatric radiology experience. Currently, there are no viable computer assisted strategies for rib fracture detection on chest radiographs. The purpose of this proposal is to develop machine learning methodology to detect rib fractures on pediatric radiographs using images from a network of hospitals. These methods will rely on a two-stage approach including a thoracic cavity segmentation stage followed by a fracture detection stage. We will explore two fracture detection strategies using novel supervised learning approaches: a heterogeneous U-net and a multi-modal regional-convolutional neural network. These methods will be trained and tested with a large set of fracture-absent radiographs (N=1000) from Seattle Children's Hospital and a diverse set of labelled fracture-present radiographs (N=500) from collaborating sites. These methods will be developed with an intentionally diverse set of radiographs, representative of the variety of fracture presentations and image quality in clinical practice, in order to position this rib fracture detection method for rapid translation to clinical practice. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to provide a computer assisted rib fracture assessment tool that would be a rapid and widely-available add-on to all pediatric chest radiograph exams, improving detection of rib fractures and potentially leading to improved identification of child abuse. NARRATIVE Automatic Rib Fracture Detection in Pediatric Radiography to Identify Non-Accidental Trauma PI: Adam M. Alessio Child abuse is a leading cause of death in children and rates of abuse are increasing. Detection of rib fractures on commonly performed chest radiographs has the potential to identify unsuspected child abuse, but it is very challenging to see fractures on these exams.

"Genotype-Phenotype Associations in Reading Disorders Project Summary/Abstract  Dyslexia and other language-based reading disorders (RD) account for nearly 85% of children receiving special education services in the U.S. RD affect between 5% and 17% of school-age children with boys at higher risk than girls. Children with RD are at high risk for academic failure and future underemployment. The current diagnosis of RD relies on behavioral symptoms. This means that RD cannot be identified until after the child has begun to learn to read. By this time, a potentially opportune window for intervention has been missed. Early identification and prevention is possible by using genetic markers because RD have a high heritability rate. The existing genetic studies about RD are limited in the sense that the gene-RD association was evaluated on a one-gene-at-a-time basis. This approach is not efficient because hundreds of thousands of genes need to be evaluated; nor is it effective because it runs a high risk of miss-detecting important genes due to overly-strict multiple test corrections applied to too many genes. Also, the existing one-gene-at-a-time approach only examines the marginal association of each gene with RD, without accounting for the joint effect of multiple genes and their interaction in relation to RD. For a complex phenotype like RD, a multi-gene- interactive mechanism is more plausible and has been supported by recent studies. Despite this, little research has been done to discover the genes simultaneously and characterize their interactions. This is partially because this field has not been able to take advantage of modern machine learning developments that provide effective and efficient approaches for genetic big data modeling and analysis. Another limitation of the existing studies is that they have been focused on single behavioral deficits and did not account for demographic difference. The short-term goals for this proposed project are to identify the gene sets associated with RD, link the gene sets to enriched functional biological pathways, characterize the gene-RD associations across the behavioral deficits in multiple reading abilities and accounting for demographic differences, and validate the findings using existing population-based datasets. These goals will be achieved using a combination of advanced machine learning algorithms and pathway analyses that are applied to existing population-based RD data sources. There are two specific aims: Aim 1 focuses on identification of significant genes and their interactions in relation to RD using sparse machine learning models and pathway analysis; Aim 2 focuses on validation for the models and findings in Aim 1 using the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) dataset and another independent dataset. The long-term goal of this research is to contribute to the development of personalized early identification methods and early intervention for children at risk of RD. Project Narrative - Public Health Relevance Children with reading disorders account for up to 17 percent of the school-age population, and are at greater risk for underachievement in school, underemployment, and related mental health problems.

"Development of clinical decision tools for management of diarrhea of children in high and low resource settings Abstract Diarrheal diseases are the among the leading cause of death in children worldwide, most of which occur in low-income countries. In high-income countries, pediatric diarrhea remains a major utilization of healthcare resources. Treatment of diarrhea is mostly empiric, with antibiotic use mostly based on clinical suspicion for bacterial causes. However, the majority of cases of diarrhea do not benefit from antibiotic use, and inappropriate use leads to toxicity and resistance. Furthermore, despite the increasing availability of rapid molecular testing, there is little data to base a decision of whom or when to test. Our overarching goal is to develop and validate clinical decision tools for management of diarrheal illnesses in children of both high and low resource settings. We will utilize prospectively-collected data from two recently-completed multicenter cohort studies of pediatric diarrhea. These studies feature extensive etiologic testing, well-characterized clinical elements, and longitudinal outcome data. We have assembled a team with expertise in pediatric diarrhea, clinical prediction rules, and machine learning methods. In Aim 1, we will use domestic data to develop and validate: a) a score for bacterial etiology, and b) a score for which patients are likely to benefit from further testing. We will derive the scores using data from IMPACT, an NIH-sponsored study of 1200 children from 5 US Emergency Departments, and validate using electronic health records from the Utah Intermountain Health System. In Aim 2, we will use international data to develop and validate: a) a diagnostic score for bacterial etiology, and b) a prognostic score for risk stratification of children who go on to poor outcomes. We will derive the scores using data from GEMS, a study of over 9400 children across 7 low-resource countries, and validate using VIDA study of children in 3 African countries. Completion of the Aims will result in the availability of a number of clinical tools that healthcare workers worldwide can use for evidence-based care of children with diarrhea. Project Narrative Diarrheal diseases are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children worldwide. The management of childhood diarrhea often depend on what type of pathogen is responsible, but in many cases testing is not affordable or feasible. We propose studies to develop clinical scores to make it easier for healthcare workers to decide how to manage children with diarrhea.",Development of clinical decision tools for management of diarrhea of children in high and low resource settings,9695923,R01AI135114,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Accounting', 'Acute', 'Africa', 'African', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Antigens', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Biological Assay', 'Case Management', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Care', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cost Effective Management', 'Country', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diarrhea', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Enteral', 'Etiology', 'Feces', 'Gastroenteritis', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health Personnel', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Income', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Minority', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Diagnostic Techniques', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Pathogen detection', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Resistance', 'Resistance development', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Sample Size', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Utah', 'Vaccines', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'clinical development', 'clinical diagnostics', 'diarrheal disease', 'evidence base', 'health care service utilization', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'low and middle-income countries', 'low income country', 'microbial', 'molecular diagnostics', 'mortality', 'outcome prediction', 'pathogen', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'tool']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2019,432549,0.1177269173877149
"Validation of Physiologic CPR Quality Using NOn-inVasive Waveform Analytics (CPR-NOVA) Project Abstract  Pediatric cardiac arrest affects thousands of children each year. Progressive heart and lung failure is a predisposing cause in many of these events. Despite improvements in survival outcomes over the past two decades, more than half of these children still do not survive. As new brain injury complicates care among survivors, the burden to these children and the public's health is substantial.  Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) – the medical procedure of providing chest compressions and ventilations during cardiac arrest – saves lives, and higher quality CPR is more effective at doing so. One method to improve CPR quality is through the use of CPR quality monitoring defibrillators. By providing real- time feedback on CPR mechanics targets such as chest compression depth and rate, they represent the best patient care option currently available to improve CPR performance. Unfortunately, most of these devices are either not approved for children or use pads that are too large for many pediatric patients. Thus, current technology limits the benefit of meaningful CPR quality monitoring to a small percentage of the children who suffer a cardiac arrest. Given the strong association between pediatric CPR quality and outcomes, new methods to monitor CPR quality are urgently needed to improve the care of this vulnerable population.  Physiologic-directed CPR is a promising technique that uses the hemodynamic response of the patient to guide the ongoing resuscitation effort. This approach overcomes the technological limitations of existing CPR quality monitoring technology by using data from patient monitors. Unfortunately, because many patients do not have intra-arterial lines in place at the time of arrest to guide CPR, its clinical impact has been limited. To overcome this limitation, the objective of this ancillary application is to leverage the existing infrastructure of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development-funded Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network (CPCCRN) and the unique hemodynamic waveform database of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute-funded parent R01 – the ICU-Resuscitation (ICU-RESUS) Project – to validate two noninvasive physiologic CPR monitors applicable to nearly every pediatric cardiac arrest: 1) end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2); and 2) PhotoPlethysmoGraphy (PPG) obtained via pulse oximetry. Using sophisticated machine learning methods, a prospective observational analytic investigation is proposed with the following Aims: 1) Evaluate ETCO2 as a noninvasive CPR quality monitor among children receiving at least 1 minute of CPR in a CPCCRN intensive care unit; and 2) Using novel machine learning classification algorithms, evaluate PPG and other candidate physiologic waveforms as noninvasive CPR quality monitors.  By leveraging the substantial infrastructure of the CPCCRN, the novel hemodynamic waveform database of ICU-RESUS, and advanced machine learning analytics, this submission represents a unique opportunity to validate two noninvasive physiologic pediatric CPR quality monitors to improve clinical care and save lives. !

"Optimizing Usability of the Orally Rehydrate Children at Home Mobile Application - Optimize ORCAH Project Summary/Abstract Acute gastroenteritis (AGE)--infectious diarrhea—is a common condition that is costly in the US and high- mortality in developing nations. The cornerstone of AGE management is oral rehydration therapy (ORT), an evidence-based technique that has saved over 54 million lives in the 50 years since its introduction. The problem we aim to address is ORT’s underuse in developed countries—specifically in the home setting. If widely adopted, ORT could reduce 80% of AGE-related healthcare visits and costs among children, eliminating 1.3 million emergency department visits and $1.5 billion in hospital costs annually. The product of this Phase I proposal is a minimum viable product of a mobile health application (app)--ORCAH (Orally Rehydrate Children at Home)—that guides caregivers of dehydrated children through administering ORT in the home. ORCAH's innovation is in the use of the mobile device's native functions for analytics, database parameters, timers, notifications, and process state—for a novel aim: making ORT accessible in the home setting in developed countries. We hypothesize we will achieve an effectiveness (percentage of ORT tasks completed) of 80%. We will achieve our objective through 3 Aims: Aim 1. Use key informant interviews with card sort testing to explicitly understand subjects’ prioritization of ORT workflow tasks and how to deliver these in a user- centered design interface, and thereby develop the optimal information architecture of ORCAH. Aim 2. Perform cycles of iterative, user-centered design using a synchronous remote platform to optimize the app’s usability. Aim 3. Pilot test ORCAH in a simulation context to demonstrate the feasibility of conducting a trial of the app using synchronous online methods. Based on the impact of ORT in developing settings, the gap presented by the absence of an intervention for improving home ORT use in developing countries, and the match between the key advantages of mobile health apps and the ORT underuse problem, we expect that the ORCAH app will provide a usability-optimized, effective and efficient technology for supporting home ORT delivery that will ultimately allow users to avoid costly and inconvenient ED visits. Objectives for Phase II include trialing ORCAH’s efficacy compared to usual care and further developing ORCAH to include a cloud-based machine learning algorithm that will continuously optimize the parameters of ORT dosing for each user based on patient- generated data and will provide generalizable evidence about ORT dosing. The long-term goals are to further develop the machine-learning functionalities to update best practices for ORT, and to develop ORCAH for developing settings. The market for ORCAH—caregivers of children with AGE—represents a promising commercial potential, as about 57.9 million children in the US experience an AGE episode annually of at least 24 hours duration. Data2Care’s commercialization strategy includes direct business-to-consumer marketing, as well as co-marketing with business partners including after-hours advice centers, rehydration fluid companies and urgent care centers. Project Narrative  Acute gastroenteritis—infectious diarrhea—is a high-mortality condition in developing nations, where a public health intervention called oral rehydration therapy (ORT) has saved over 54 million lives and is considered the cornerstone of management; however, ORT is underused in developed nations including the United States, resulting in an estimated excess of 1.3 million emergency department visits by children and $1.5 billion in hospital costs for children annually. Through developing a mobile health application—ORCAH (Orally Rehydrate Children at Home)—that guides caregivers of dehydrated children through giving ORT in the household setting, we expect that this application will enhance health and reduce illness in the short term by enabling users to avoid costly and inconvenient emergency department visits, and the associated costs. In the long term, through adding a cloud-based machine learning algorithm to ORCAH that will continuously optimize the parameters of ORT dosing for each user based on patient-generated data, we expect to generate generalizable evidence about ORT dosing parameters that will improve the science, delivery and efficacy of ORT.",Optimizing Usability of the Orally Rehydrate Children at Home Mobile Application - Optimize ORCAH,9906781,R41HD101158,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Businesses', 'Caregivers', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Colorado', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Diarrhea', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Emergency Department Physician', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency department visit', 'Enrollment', 'Fostering', 'Gastroenteritis', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Care Visit', 'Home environment', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Household', 'IV Fluid', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mobile Health Application', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Notification', 'Oral', 'Oral Rehydration Therapy', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Rehydrations', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Software Engineering', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Update', 'User-Computer Interface', 'base', 'cloud based', 'commercial application', 'commercialization', 'comparative efficacy', 'cost', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'informant', 'innovation', 'iterative design', 'mHealth', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mobile application', 'model development', 'mortality', 'novel', 'pediatric emergency', 'pediatric trauma', 'programs', 'prototype', 'public health intervention', 'recruit', 'simulation', 'software development', 'treatment as usual', 'urgent care', 'usability', 'user centered design']",NICHD,"DATA2CARE TECHNOLOGIES, LLC",R41,2019,145682,0.06697866256610259
"Data-driven multidimensional modeling of nonverbal communication in typical and atypical development ABSTRACT This proposal will develop innovative technology for data-driven, multimodal characterization of nonverbal communication (NVC) in typical and atypical development. Prior research has provided qualitative descriptions of the development of children's use of gaze and gesture to regulate social interactions, but there are no objective, automated tools for measuring NVC behaviors, nor computational models to explain their coordination and timing in social interactions. This proposal will apply advanced probabilistic modeling techniques from machine learning and data mining to a rich corpus of children's behavior, including automated measures of children's posture, head pose, gaze direction, arm movements, and hand configurations derived from color and depth cameras and accelerometers. By automatically learning probabilistic latent variable models from movement data, we will obtain compact, data-driven descriptions of NVC and its coordination in children with autism, children with developmental delays without autism, and typically developing children (Aim 1). We will validate our models by demonstrating their ability to predict children's behavior, including diagnostic group and one-year language outcomes (Aim 2). We will test whether novel NVC patterns can be uncovered with bottom-up clustering of motor movement data (Aim 3). We predict our models will have greater explanatory and predictive power compared to current measures of NVC, which are typically human-coded behaviors that are descriptive, but rely on a-priori definitions of higher level behaviors. The models we develop will capture the fine-grained structure, coordination, and timing of NVC behaviors during social interactions, and thus allow us to characterize these behaviors with an unprecedented level of detail. Because interventions for young children with ASD target NVC skills, our automated measurement tools will provide clinicians with powerful new tools to assess the extent to which these treatments are efficacious. In addition, automated tools for dense measurement of fine-grained changes in NVC would enable clinicians to assess profiles of strengths and weaknesses for purposes of treatment planning, to dynamically tailor treatment to clients' changing abilities, and ultimately to accurately capture whether treatment is working. Finally, the measurement capabilities will provide researchers with a novel, cost-effective approach to analyze video recordings, at a scale that is not currently feasible due to a reliance on human coding.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) affects 1 in 68 children in the US. This project is focused on developing automated tools to characterize behaviors considered to be core, early emerging markers of autism, and that represent common treatment targets in this group. This has clear implications for identifying those at risk for autism and for ongoing clinical care.",Data-driven multidimensional modeling of nonverbal communication in typical and atypical development,9750288,R01MH114999,"['Accelerometer', 'Affect', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Child', 'Child Behavior', 'Child Development', 'Client', 'Code', 'Color', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnostic', 'Face', 'Future', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Nonverbal Communication', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Posture', 'Production', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Social Interaction', 'Statistical Models', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Video Recording', 'Visit', 'Wrist', 'arm movement', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'clinical care', 'common treatment', 'communication behavior', 'cost effective', 'data mining', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'gaze', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovative technologies', 'joint attention', 'language outcome', 'learning strategy', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'sensor', 'skills', 'social communication', 'tool', 'treatment planning']",NIMH,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2019,354625,0.001720217378158229
"Computational Models for the Prediction and Prevention of Child Traumatic Stress - Resubmission - 1 Project Summary/Abstract At least 40% of children will experience a traumatic event. Of those who experience a trauma, 15-40% will develop Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and other adverse psychiatric, health, and functional outcomes (herein called Child Traumatic Stress - CTS). Despite decades of research on risk factors for CTS, the field has not arrived at specific risk factor models that can accurately predict the likelihood of CTS outcomes or identify factors that – if changed – would change their likelihood. Knowledge about changes in factors that result in changes in outcomes is, by definition, causal. The vast majority of findings in the literature on risk for CTS cannot provide such causal knowledge because such findings were based on the application of correlational methods to observational data. Experimental research cannot – for all practical purposes - be conducted for human research on risk for CTS. Thus, the field is left with correlational observational research as the near exclusive generator of empirical knowledge on risk for CTS, and such knowledge is unsuitable to guide the actions (i.e. interventions) that must be taken to change children's likelihood of acquiring CTS outcomes. We propose to address this considerable barrier to progress by applying methods that can enable confident causal inference with large observational data sets containing a broad diversity of risk variables for CTS. Machine Learning (ML) predictive and causal modeling methods will be applied to discover causal relationships among measured variables from observational data: and from such determined causal relationships, to estimate the effect on a CTS outcome when a causal variable is manipulated (i.e. intervention simulation). We will build models for outcomes associated with childhood trauma in the literature and that entail significant burden to children's well-being, functioning, and development: PTSD, Depression, Substance Abuse, Health, and Educational Performance. Project Narrative This application proposes research to apply an array of powerful and innovative computational methods – well validated in other fields – to advance the capacity to predict and prevent traumatic stress in children and adolescents. These methods will be applied to several highly relevant, existing data sets that cover diverse populations of traumatized youth and with diverse data collection designs. The data sets and the analytic methodologies have been carefully selected to advance knowledge related to prediction, discovery of causal mechanisms, and the identification of promising preventative interventions for child traumatic stress.",Computational Models for the Prediction and Prevention of Child Traumatic Stress - Resubmission - 1,9885086,R01MH119114,"['18 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Birth', 'Child', 'Child Traumatic Stress', 'Child Welfare', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Decision Trees', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Emotional', 'Ethics', 'Etiology', 'Genotype', 'Health', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Prevention', 'Randomized', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Stress', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Youth', 'base', 'causal model', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'functional outcomes', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'pediatric trauma', 'personalized predictions', 'predictive modeling', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'simulation', 'social', 'tool', 'trauma exposure', 'traumatic event', 'traumatized children']",NIMH,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,781926,0.02230313118780579
"Decoding the neural time-course of spoken word recognition Project Summary  Word recognition is crucial not only for comprehending spoken language but for mapping spoken words onto text in reading. Individuals with language and reading deficits (e.g., Specific Language Impairment, Dyslexia, Autism, which together affect up to 16% of children) have been shown to have deficits in word recognition, making it crucial to understand this process. A hallmark of word recognition is that listeners activate neural representations of multiple candidate words that are consistent with the early acoustic input, and these candidates compete for recognition as they unfold in real-time.  The overall goal of this proposal is to capitalize on recent developments in multivariate and machine- learning techniques for analyzing signals obtained from the human brain to measure the real-time unfolding of spoken word recognition. Although these techniques have been most widely used with fMRI data, we propose to extend them to EEG data because EEG is easily used with children and clinical populations, and provides access to the time-course of word recognition, thereby revealing underlying cognitive mechanisms of word recognition, such as lexical competition. Our preliminary findings using this EEG-based paradigm have demonstrated that we can decode the recognition of a specific word (among a set of 8-12 alternatives) at each msec time-step after stimulus onset. The method is sensitive to partial activation of competing words that share some phonological features with the target word, thereby revealing the dynamics of lexical competition as the word-recognition system settles on the final target.  Our objectives are to conduct a series of small-scale experiments that achieve three aims. First, we develop and optimize the method with adults (e.g., the experimental procedure and computational implementation). Second, we validate the method with adults by measuring its test/re-test reliability, comparing its estimates of word recognition with traditional behavioral paradigms, and examining how lexical status, and semantic and orthographic expectations shape lexical competition revealed by the EEG measure. This will yield a new, non-invasive, and highly reliable method suitable for assessing spoken word recognition in adults, children, and special populations. Third, we will preliminarily extend the method to children to pave the way for future developmental studies. Taken together, accomplishing these three aims would provide an innovative and powerful tool for assessing a crucial component of language processing in a wide variety of typical and atypical populations.

"Development of a novel mobile health tool for age-specific dehydration assessment and management in patients with diarrheal disease Project Summary Diarrheal diseases lead to an estimated 2.4 billion episodes of illness and 1.3 million deaths each year, with the majority of those deaths occurring in adults, adolescents, and children over five years. As the severity of diarrheal diseases can vary widely, accurately assessing dehydration status remains the most crucial step in preventing morbidity and mortality. While patients with severe dehydration require hospital admission and immediate resuscitation with intravenous fluids to prevent hemodynamic compromise, organ ischemia, and death, those with mild to moderate dehydration can be treated in outpatient settings with relatively inexpensive oral rehydration solution. Yet, while several tools have been validated for use in children under five years of age, no clinical diagnostic tool has ever been validated for the assessment of dehydration severity in adults, adolescents or children over five years of age with acute diarrhea. Differences in both adult physiology and diarrhea etiology may compromise the accuracy of clinical diagnostic models developed for use in young children. The proposed research will derive the very first age-specific clinical diagnostic models created for the assessment of dehydration status in patients over five years of age with acute diarrhea, incorporate those models into a new mobile health (mHealth) tool, and validate the performance of this tool in a new population of patients with acute diarrhea. To accomplish this task, we will enroll a prospective cohort of adults and children over five years of age with acute diarrhea presenting to the rehydration unit of the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b) in Dhaka, Bangladesh and collect data on presenting clinical signs and symptoms shown to correlate with dehydration severity in prior studies. We will then employ machine learning techniques to derive age-specific clinical diagnostic models for assessing dehydration in patients over five years of age with acute diarrhea. We will conduct formative research among clinicians working at icddr,b to develop an innovative mobile phone based platform which will incorporate these new age-specific diagnostic models for rapid use by frontline health workers. Finally, we will validate both the accuracy and reliability of the newly developed mHealth tool in a new population of adults and children over five years of age with acute diarrhea. Once developed and properly validated, this novel mHealth tool has the potential to help physicians, nurses, and other healthcare providers more accurately diagnose dehydration severity and better determine the optimal management strategy for patients with acute diarrhea. Improved diagnostic approaches may in turn be shown to reduce both the morbidity and mortality that occurs as a result of missed diagnoses of dehydration, as well as the adverse events and inappropriate utilization of limited healthcare resources that can result from inaccurate diagnoses of dehydration. Project Narrative Dehydration due to diarrheal diseases remains a leading cause of death in both children and adults worldwide, yet no clinical tools have ever been validated for the assessment of dehydration severity in adults or children over five years of age with acute diarrhea. The proposed research will both develop and validate an innovative new mobile phone based platform for the assessment of dehydration severity in adults, adolescents, and older children with acute diarrhea. This new mobile health tool will help physicians, nurses, and other providers worldwide to determine the best management strategies for patients with acute diarrhea, potentially improving and rationalizing care for the hundreds of millions of patients each year presenting to healthcare facilities around the world with acute diarrhea.",Development of a novel mobile health tool for age-specific dehydration assessment and management in patients with diarrheal disease,9771462,R01DK116163,"['5 year old', 'Acute Diarrhea', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Bangladesh', 'Beds', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Car Phone', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cost Savings', 'Data', 'Dehydration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diarrhea', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Future', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'IV Fluid', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'International Unit', 'Ischemia', 'Lead', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nurses', 'Oral', 'Organ', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Prospective cohort', 'Provider', 'Rehydration Solutions', 'Rehydrations', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Severities', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'accurate diagnosis', 'age group', 'base', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical predictors', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'diarrheal disease', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'international center', 'low and middle-income countries', 'mHealth', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'prevent', 'success', 'tool', 'usability']",NIDDK,RHODE ISLAND HOSPITAL,R01,2019,556605,0.03703644271110692
"Longitudinal Study of Brain Imaging and Cognitive Markers of Tourette Syndrome in Children PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Chronic tic disorders (referred to here as Tourette syndrome: TS) are complex and often serious neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by motor and/or vocal tics. Tics are brief, repetitive, unwanted movements or noises, which can severely impinge upon quality of life. While TS was once thought to be relatively rare, recent epidemiological studies find that 1-6% of all children meet criteria for a chronic tic disorder, making it a significant public health problem. Typically in TS, tics begin around age 5-7 years old, peak in severity around age 10-12 years, and improve throughout adolescence into adulthood. However, not all patients show this improvement during adolescence, as ~30% continue to experience significant impairment into adulthood. Thus, the years during and immediately following peak symptom severity represent a critical time for TS, during which individuals may show considerable improvement or not. Surprisingly little research has targeted this critical developmental stage of TS. Moreover, longitudinal investigations of predictors of TS outcome have focused primarily on single variables (e.g., caudate nucleus volume or tic severity). Yet there is considerable evidence that the neurobiology of TS is quite complex, involving interactions within and between multiple brain networks. For example, our preliminary findings demonstrate stronger brain functional connectivity among cognitive control networks and motor networks, as well as altered white and gray matter volumes in prefrontal and subcortical regions in TS. Using this complex information may be more informative for understanding tic severity changes and predicting clinical outcome. We propose a longitudinal study in which we will capture the developmental stage of TS with the greatest likelihood of change in tic severity (beginning at age 10-12 years), and will follow these children to track the development of brain and cognitive features, and how they relate to symptom change, over time. To capture the complex neurobiology of TS, we will collect whole-brain resting state functional connectivity, structural MRI, cognitive, and clinical data from a group of children with TS. We will compare these children to tic-free controls (from the NIH's ABCD Study Washington University site subject pool), as comparison to typical development will be essential for interpreting longitudinal changes in TS. We will target diagnostic differences and developmental changes in specific functional brain networks, regional brain volumes, and cognitive abilities. We will also use multivariate machine learning methods to unify this rich dataset to classify and make predictions about individual children. This approach analyzes complex patterns of multidimensional data rather than single variables, providing the potential for clinical utility and to contribute converging evidence about mechanism. Identifying mechanisms underlying symptom change will provide insight into why many children with TS improve while some do not, potentially yielding new targets for treatment and predictive indicators of persistent tics. Markers of symptom improvement could be targeted to treat children who do not improve. Being able to make predictions about individual children could identify those children who need those interventions most. We have expertise with every step of the proposed study, but the application to longitudinal data over the first half of the second decade of life is novel. PROJECT NARRATIVE Children with Tourette syndrome (TS) follow varying clinical courses, as some will experience substantial improvement over the course of adolescence while others will continue to experience significant impairment. Understanding the brain and cognitive features that mediate or predict different outcomes could revolutionize prognosis and treatment. This project will study children with and without TS over time, during the key ages of 10 to 14 years, to (1) investigate how brain and cognitive markers of TS develop over adolescence and relate to changes in symptom severity, and (2) make predictions about future symptom severity for individual children.",Longitudinal Study of Brain Imaging and Cognitive Markers of Tourette Syndrome in Children,9818160,R01MH118217,"['12 year old', '7 year old', 'Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Future', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Motor Tics', 'Movement', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Tic disorder', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vocal Tics', 'Washington', 'base', 'brain volume', 'caudate nucleus', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'epidemiologic data', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'gray matter', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal design', 'mind control', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'predict clinical outcome', 'putamen', 'symptomatic improvement', 'white matter']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,784433,0.07165123104434805
"The New Tics Study: A Novel Approach to Pathophysiology and Cause of Tic Disorders Project Abstract At least 20% of all children have tics at some time in their life, making tic disorders a subject of substantial public health interest. However, only about 3% of all children have tics that last for a year or more. Thus chronic tic disorders, including Tourette syndrome, can be conceptualized as a two- step process: tics start, and then they fail to remit. By the numbers, the second part of this process is the more unusual and perhaps more closely related to disease, yet surprisingly, almost no research has examined this critical period after a first tic appears but before it is clear whether the child will go on to have a chronic tic disorder. Therefore prior research that has identified abnormalities of brain structure and function in children with TS generally does not clarify whether these abnormalities are related to tic appearance or to the more important process of tic disappearance. Furthermore, tic disappearance can be observed prospectively, allowing powerful within-subject analyses to test whether features of brain structure or function shortly after tic onset predict remission of tics before TS is diagnosable, and whether such features are state-related or more durable markers of vulnerability to tics. Colleagues in the TS field have agreed that such studies would be valuable, but have suspected that recruitment would be extremely difficult. However, we have now demonstrated enrollment of subjects with New Tics (defined as beginning within the previous 6 months, median 3.6 months) at a rate of 16 subjects per year when recruitment efforts were at their peak—though still on a shoestring budget without full staffing or media advertisements. We have implemented subject preparation and quality control methods that have allowed us to acquire structural and functional MRI data of high quality in many subjects. We now propose to enroll an additional 70 subjects with New Tics and characterize them carefully at baseline and at the 1-year anniversary of tic onset (when TS can first be diagnosed). Both time points will include clinical data, structural and functional MRI, and neuropsychological measures including ability to suppress tics. We expect that complete data will be available for 55-70 subjects (including those already collected), since MRI is sensitive to movement and we are selecting for subjects with tics and additional difficulty holding still (about half of children with tics also have ADHD). We will compare baseline data from this sample to matched tic-free control subjects, and to matched subjects who already have TS or a chronic tic disorder (leveraging existing data in our laboratories to provide some of the clinical and MRI data for these groups). Analyses will include tests of specific a priori hypotheses as well as machine learning analyses of the complete dataset. These comparisons will allow us to discover whether imaging differences in children with TS are present long before TS can be diagnosed, whether they fade when tics improve, and whether they predict outcome in children with new tics. Investigation of this “pre-Tourette” population opens an entirely new window for etiologic discovery in tic disorders. It may also have important clinical consequences, if the results identify which newly- ticcing children are at highest risk for development of a chronic tic disorder. Public Health Relevance Statement At least 20% of all children have tics at some time in their life, making tic disorders a subject of substantial public health interest. In many children the tics will disappear before they've lasted as long as a year, but in others they go on to become Tourette syndrome or Chronic Tic Disorder (TS/CTD). Prior research generally has not clarified whether abnormalities of brain structure and function in children with TS/CTD are related to tic appearance or to the more important process of tic disappearance. This project will study children with recent-onset tics using clinical evaluation, MRI, and neuropsychological measures, and repeat these measures at the earliest time point that TS/CTD can be diagnosed. The results from the first assessment will be compared to results from two matching comparison groups: children with no personal or family history of tics, and children who have had tics for more than a year (Existing TS/CTD). This new approach may provide a new angle on research into Tourette syndrome, in addition to providing sorely needed information about prognosis for children who just started ticcing.",The New Tics Study: A Novel Approach to Pathophysiology and Cause of Tic Disorders,9717307,R01MH104030,"['Advertisements', 'Age', 'Anniversary', 'Appearance', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Budgets', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Family history of', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Image', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Neuropsychology', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Quality Control', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Rest', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Tic disorder', 'Time', 'brain abnormalities', 'caudate nucleus', 'comparison group', 'critical period', 'dexterity', 'follow-up', 'habit learning', 'high risk', 'improved', 'inattention', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'medical attention', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'phenomenological models', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'secondary analysis', 'vector']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,683541,0.09991584157417101
"Neural mechanisms of successful intervention in children with dyslexia Reading instruction prompts the emergence of neural circuits that are specialized for rapidly translating printed symbols into sound and meaning. Understanding how these circuits differ in children with dyslexia, and change with learning, is an important scientific challenge that holds practical implications for education. The proposed research employs longitudinal measurements in children with dyslexia over the course of a highly effective intervention program to: (a) determine how brain structure and function change in response to reading instruction; and (b) investigate neurobiological factors that predispose a child to struggle or succeed in the intervention. Thus, this proposal seeks to determine both how education shapes brain development, and how a child’s unique neurobiology predicts educational outcomes. Aim 1) White matter plasticity and learning – White matter was previously considered static infrastructure; it is now known that many cellular properties of the white matter change with learning. Reading interventions provide a powerful tool to study experience-dependent plasticity in the human brain. Based on novel quantitative MRI and diffusion MRI measurements developed by the PI and collaborators, it is now possible to quantify changes in cell density, intra-axonal water and myelination at millimeter resolution. Longitudinal measurements collected before, during, and after the intervention will be used to model the time-course of white matter plasticity associated with improvements in reading skills, and investigate the biological mechanisms that underlie differences in learning among children. Aim 2) Bottom-up and top-down computations in the reading circuit - When our eyes fixate upon a word, a cascade of neural processes is initiated, beginning in the visual system and progressing through a series of computations that translate the visual representation into sound and meaning. We have developed the first model of the neural computations performed by critical components of the brain’s reading circuitry. Based on this new understanding of computations in the literate adult brain, we will investigate how computations differ in children with dyslexia, and change in response to reading instruction. Aim 3) Neural biomarkers of learning outcomes - Even in a controlled and intensive learning environment, some children show substantial improvements in reading skill, while others show limited change. What biological factors predispose a child to excel or struggle when provided a high-quality intervention? Pre- intervention MRI measurements will be examined as predictor variables for individual differences in intervention learning rate, and long-term, post-intervention outcomes. Aim 3 will capitalize machine learning to develop a model of the neuroanatomical factors that predict learning outcomes. Dyslexia, an impairment in accurate or fluent word recognition, is the most common learning disability affecting roughly ten percent of children. This proposal capitalizes on cutting edge neuroimaging methods, in combination with carefully controlled educational interventions and behavioral measurements, to generate a new understanding of how successful intervention shapes the development of the brain circuits that support skilled reading. A deeper understanding of the mechanisms of successful remediation of dyslexia, and individual differences in learning, will pave the way for personalized approaches to dyslexia treatment.",Neural mechanisms of successful intervention in children with dyslexia,9815781,R01HD095861,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Caliber', 'Cell Density', 'Child', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dyslexia', 'Education', 'Educational Intervention', 'Eye', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual Differences', 'Infrastructure', 'Instruction', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Myelin Sheath', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurons', 'Orthography', 'Outcome', 'Predictive Factor', 'Predisposing Factor', 'Process', 'Property', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual system structure', 'Water', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'brain remodeling', 'brain shape', 'cognitive task', 'density', 'educational atmosphere', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'intervention program', 'learning outcome', 'literate', 'millimeter', 'mouse model', 'myelination', 'neural circuit', 'neural model', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'phonology', 'post intervention', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'remediation', 'response', 'skills', 'sound', 'successful intervention', 'tool', 'white matter', 'white matter change']",NICHD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,535853,0.048915136864047803
"Predicting Heterogeneous Neurodevelopmental Outcomes in School-age Children with Early Caregiving Adversities Project Summary Children with severe Early Caregiving Adversities (ECAs) are the most vulnerable to psychopathology as a result of prolonged neglect, abuse, and care disruptions that impact neurodevelopment. It is currently estimated that addressing ECAs would lead to a 29.8% reduction in worldwide psychiatric illness. Existing research, including findings from the original grant of this renewal, has demonstrated that there is a very strong link between ECA exposures and increased risk for psychopathology and altered neurodevelopment at the population level; and yet, given the heterogeneity in ECA populations, there is a critical gap in knowledge regarding how ECAs increase any specific risks to an individual child. The proposed research addresses this significant mental health problem by combining sophisitcated data-analysis methods that use experiential and phenotypic heterogeneity together with longitudinal neuroimaging and behavioral assessments in school-age children. This approach will increase precision when linking ECAs and child outcomes associated with the Research Domain Criteria constructs of Negative Valence and Cognitive Control Systems (NVS/CCS). The overarching goal of the present work is to create an explanatory model for the heterogeneous impact of ECAs on neurodevelopmental trajectories of NVS/CCS. This project's premise is that children exposed to ECAs have highly heterogeneous developmental histories as well as heterogeneous outcomes; therefore, prediction of ECA outcomes requires cutting-edge, sophisticated data analytic methods. We hypothesize that data-driven approaches will 1) more precisely define NVS/CCS outcomes for school-aged children with ECAs, and 2) provide a more robust explanatory model for links between ECAs and NVS/CCS trajectories. Aim 1A subtypes children with a history of ECAs based on 2.5-year developmental trajectories of NVS/CCS. 300 6-8 year old children (250 sampled from previous institutional and foster care; 50 community comparisons) will provide neuroimaging, behavioral, and self/caregiver reports every 15 months for 2.5 years. Biclustering methods will be applied to the baseline and follow-up data to identify homogeneous NVS/CCS final outcome clusters of children. Aim 1B develops an explanatory model to predict developmental trajectory subtypes for children with ECAs, from early life profiles and brain/behavior phenotypes at the time of enrollment. Machine learning methods applied to early life profiles, baseline NVS/CCS profiles, and sex, will predict developmental trajectory subtypes. Aim 2 identifies adverse and protective life events during the 2.5-year assessment period that are predictive of 2.5-year follow-up outcomes for children with ECAs. The inclusion of child-sex and current life- events will identify potential divergence in pathways across middle childhood. This prospective design of children exposed to various ECAs is designed to develop predictive models for ECA trajectory subtypes and outcomes, which can inform our understanding of risk and protective factors in accord with the goals of precision medicine.   Project Narrative Children with severe Early Caregiving Adversities (ECAs) are the most vulnerable to psychopathology, and it is estimated that addressing ECAs would lead to a 29.8% reduction in worldwide psychiatric illness. Existing research has demonstrated that there is a very strong link between ECA exposures and increased risk for psychopathology and altered neurodevelopment at the population level; and yet, given the heterogeneity in ECA populations, there is a critical gap in knowledge regarding how ECAs increase any specific risks to an individual child. The proposed research addresses this significant mental health problem by combining longitudinal multimodal brain imaging and high- dimensional behavioral assessments in school-age children together with sophisticated data analytic techniques to increase precision when linking heterogeneous ECAs and child outcome with the goal of predicting mental health outcomes and identifying children who would benefit most from specific early interventions.  ",Predicting Heterogeneous Neurodevelopmental Outcomes in School-age Children with Early Caregiving Adversities,9731666,R01MH091864,"['10 year old', '8 year old', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Catalogs', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Child Rearing', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Communities', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Decision Trees', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Grouping', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Nature', 'Negative Valence', 'Orphanages', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathway interactions', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Psychopathology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'School-Age Population', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Work', 'abuse neglect', 'analytical method', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'caregiving', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive control', 'computerized', 'design', 'follow-up', 'foster care', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'middle childhood', 'multimodality', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'outcome prediction', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prepuberty', 'prospective', 'protective factors', 'resilience', 'sex', 'socioeconomics', 'violence exposure']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R01,2019,736672,0.10922623473364844
"THE PRETERM BEHAVIORAL PHENOTYPE: TRAJECTORIES OF PSYCHOPATHOLOGY & CHANGES IN CEREBRAL CONNECTIVITY PROJECT SUMMARY: Children born prematurely are at elevated risk for psychiatric disorders, including ADHD, autism and anxiety. Indeed, the ‘preterm behavioral phenotype’ is comprised of inattention, anxiety and social- communication impairments. This constellation of comorbid disorders persists across the lifespan, accounting for long-term impairment and diminished quality of life among very preterm (VPT; born ≤32 weeks gestation) children, a population at high risk for altered brain development. Yet, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the increased prevalence of these symptoms remain undetermined. Further, VPT children face high exposure rates to deleterious psychosocial risk factors which have similarly been linked to adverse psychiatric outcomes and changes in brain development. We posit that decreased connectivity and the resulting diminished developmental trajectories within and across key functional networks (e.g., default mode, frontoparietal control and cingulo-opercular networks) and related white matter tracts (e.g., cingulum, corpus callosum and uncinate) underlie comorbid preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms that persist or worsen at age 9-10. This process begins during infancy and extends to middle childhood, with psychosocial risk playing an important modifying role. Advances in MRI methodology now enable characterization of structural and functional brain networks with unparalleled spatial and temporal resolution. Here, we couple these highly innovative, state-of-the-art MRI techniques with detailed psychiatric assessments to study our unique, sociodemographically-diverse longitudinal cohort of VPT and term-born children (N=302) with high rates of psychosocial adversity now reaching age 9-10. The cohort has been followed since birth, including prospective collection of high-quality neonatal functional and structural connectivity MRI data and longitudinal assessments of preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms and psychosocial and familial factors at ages 2 and 5, with >80% cohort retention to date at both assessment waves. Continued evaluation of this enriched cohort provides an opportunity to determine: 1) trajectories of preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms to define early indicators of later impairment enabling targeted interventions, 2) relationships between neonatal and age 9-10 functional and structural connectivity and these deficits, and 3) the modifying role of psychosocial adversity. Application of cutting-edge MRI acquisition and analysis methods, including machine learning approaches, enables unprecedented characterization of the effects of VPT birth on connectivity in the developing brain. We will extend these methods to delineate relationships between imaging measures and preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms, improving understanding of modifiable effects of early life exposures and psychosocial risk on psychiatric outcomes. These data are critical for developing individual- level neuroimaging, behavioral and psychosocial presymptomatic predictive models for adverse mental health outcomes, measures necessary to inform and evaluate treatments applicable during sensitive developmental periods which mitigate risks of psychopathology associated with prematurity and psychosocial adversity. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH This study is designed to improve our understanding of the changes in brain structure and function that underlie the elevated rates of inattention, anxiety and autism spectrum symptoms now increasingly recognized in prematurely-born children. Using cutting-edge magnetic resonance imaging methods, we will investigate these relationships in a unique, longitudinally-studied cohort of very preterm and term-born children with high rates of psychosocial adversity now reaching age 9-10 years and previously studied using neuroimaging during infancy and detailed assessments of psychiatric symptoms during early childhood. The overarching goal is development of new approaches for earlier, more accurate identification of children at risk for these disorders, enabling progress toward targeted interventions which improve outcomes by limiting risks for psychopathology associated with prematurity and psychosocial adversity.",THE PRETERM BEHAVIORAL PHENOTYPE: TRAJECTORIES OF PSYCHOPATHOLOGY & CHANGES IN CEREBRAL CONNECTIVITY,9731643,R01MH113570,"['Accounting', 'Age', 'Anisotropy', 'Anxiety', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Cerebrum', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Effect', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neonatal', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pattern', 'Perinatal', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Infant', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Survival Rate', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'associated symptom', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'early childhood', 'early life exposure', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'inattention', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'middle childhood', 'neonatal magnetic resonance imaging', 'neonate', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'premature', 'prospective', 'psychiatric disability', 'psychiatric symptom', 'psychosocial', 'sex', 'social', 'social communication', 'social communication impairment', 'sociodemographics', 'targeted treatment', 'temporal measurement', 'white matter']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,631649,0.02504731526375336
"Microbiota, Inflammation and Environmental Enteric Dysfunction (MiEED) PROJECT SUMMARY In this application, I am requesting support from a career development award to support my research proposal titled “Microbiota, Inflammation and Environmental Enteric Dysfunction”. I will be undertaking this work with the mentorship of Dr. Jeffrey Gordon (Primary US mentor) at the Washington University, St Louis and Dr. Asad Ali (Primary LMIC mentor) at the Aga Khan University. This project builds on our existing studies of Environmental Enteric Dysfunction (EED), funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The current application aims to improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of EED by studying the evolution of gut microbial configuration in children who have clinical and histological evidence of EED. EED is common in children living in impoverished conditions with limited access to clean drinking water and sanitation. Histopathological changes of EED in small bowel mucosa include alteration in crypt to villous ratio along with lymphocytic infiltration of the villous epithelium and lamina propria. Although studies involving biopsies of small bowel mucosa are critical to study EED, these studies are uncommon because of logistic challenges involving performing endoscopies in field settings in LMICs. We have previously demonstrated in an ongoing BMGF funded study that we are able to safely obtain such biopsies, we now have a unique opportunity to study the relationship between gut microbiome evolution and EED in this cohort. The central hypothesis of the current application is that children with histological confirmation of EED have shared features of a bacterial community which is different from healthy controls and non-EED subjects, and that such changes in bacterial configuration are associated with enteric and systemic inflammation. For testing these hypotheses, evaluation of gut microbiome in healthy and stunted children will be carried out to identify the age discriminatory bacterial taxa in children with and without confirmation of EED. Dr. Gordon will be providing mentorship and experience in gut microbiome and microbiota analysis. Dr. Ali will provide the needed infrastructure of the field site and laboratory facilities, along with linking the microbiome analysis with clinical and histological outcomes of interest. The Aga Khan University is a leading regional research institute with multiple support systems for junior investigators which will be vital for my career transition as an independent scientist. My long term goal is to be the principal investigator of my own laboratory, focusing on studying the gut microbiome and its relationship with communicable and non-communicable diseases. I envision working on microbiota derived therapy for EED, and to find targets in the inflammatory pathways driven by changes in gut homeostasis. PROJECT NARRATIVE Globally, Pakistan has the third highest rate of stunting among children aged < 5 years. Environmental Enteric Dysfunction (EED) is proposed to be a critical factor responsible for chronic growth faltering in children in resource limited settings. This research utilizes an innovative approach to study a program of postnatal gut microbiome development in children and its impact on child growth. This proposal will provide an ideal training platform for a translational scientist, covering the domains of mucosal immunology, histopathology, computational analysis, microbiome analysis and host immune responses. The skills learnt from this project will be critical for the capacity development of both the LMIC institution and the candidate herself.","Microbiota, Inflammation and Environmental Enteric Dysfunction (MiEED)",9712985,K43TW010697,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Bangladesh', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Birth', 'Career Mobility', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronology', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Community Developments', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Duodenum', 'Endoscopy', 'Enteral', 'Epithelium', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Gut Mucosa', 'Height', 'Histologic', 'Histopathologic Grade', 'Histopathology', 'Homeostasis', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunoglobulin A', 'Immunologist', 'Immunology', 'Impairment', 'Infiltration', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Intestinal permeability', 'Intestines', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lamina Propria', 'Link', 'Logistics', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malnutrition', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Milieu Therapy', 'Modeling', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Mus', 'Outcome', 'Pakistan', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sanitation', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Small Intestines', 'Structure', 'Support System', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Sustainable Development', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Villous', 'Washington', 'Weight', 'Work', 'aged', 'bacterial community', 'base', 'career', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'cytokine', 'drinking water', 'enteric pathogen', 'environmental change', 'experience', 'fecal microbiota', 'global health', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'high risk', 'host microbiome', 'immune activation', 'immune function', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'intestinal villi', 'laboratory facility', 'learning strategy', 'low and middle-income countries', 'low income country', 'member', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiome analysis', 'microbiota', 'peripheral blood', 'postnatal', 'preclinical study', 'programs', 'rRNA Genes', 'random forest', 'skills', 'translational scientist']",FIC,AGA KHAN UNIVERSITY (PAKISTAN),K43,2019,64933,0.04254303503459196
"Novel Accelerometer Calibration and Validation in Children andAdolescents Summary Accelerometers have been embraced by the scientific community as valid and reliable physical activity (PA) assessment tools. This is especially true in some sub-populations, such as children, who lack the ability to self- report their behaviors. Tremendous progress has been made in the objective assessment of PA and sedentary behavior (SB). Several measurement challenges remain that limit our ability to identify; dose-response associations with disease and risk factors, prevalence and determinants of these important health behaviors, changes in behavior due to time and intervention efforts. To overcome these challenges, we propose novel calibration procedures that will leverage the richness of three axes of raw acceleration data during free-living calibration activities, from wrist- and hip-worn accelerometers. Consistent with current PA recommendations for youth, the proposed study will focus on calibrating and validating accelerometer output to quantify intensity and duration of PA and identifying specific predominant modes of activity (e.g., sedentary time, locomotion, and fine/gross motor activity). Our primary goal is to follow best-practices data collection and analysis procedures to develop a comprehensive set of accelerometer algorithms that will accurately and precisely estimate minutes of various intensities of PA and mode of activity from hip- and wrist-worn accelerometers in children and adolescents (18 months to 21 years old), using video recorded direct observation during free-living activities as the criterion measure. Narrative Accurate and precise estimates of physical activity, sedentary behavior, and patterns of those behaviors in youth are essential in order to identify changes in those behaviors and to inform related policy decisions. The proposed research will extend previous accelerometer calibration studies by videotaping free-living activities in a large sample across a wide age range of children and adolescents. The raw acceleration signals from both hip- and wrist-worn devices will be analyzed using linear regression and machine learning methods to generate a family of freely available algorithms that produce accurate and precise estimates, reducing inconsistencies and confusion on use of previous accelerometer cutpoints in youth.",Novel Accelerometer Calibration and Validation in Children andAdolescents,9701986,R01DK110148,"['21 year old', 'Acceleration', 'Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavior', 'Calibration', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Confusion', 'Controlled Environment', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Family', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Health behavior change', 'Hip region structure', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Linear Regressions', 'Locomotion', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Output', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Physical assessment', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Videotape', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'Youth', 'actigraphy', 'age group', 'base', 'behavior change', 'computerized data processing', 'disorder risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'response', 'sedentary', 'sedentary lifestyle']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST,R01,2019,362004,0.06274023999338837
"Automated point-of-care identification of innocent Still's murmur in children PROJECT SUMMARY The overall goal of the proposed research and technology transfer effort is to develop a low-cost, point-of-care, mobile device-based technology for automated identification of Still's murmur, the most common innocent (benign and harmless) heart murmur of childhood. This novel technology could reduce the current rate of over half a million children unnecessarily referred to pediatric cardiologists by primary care providers each year in the United States. In Phase I, AusculTech Dx and Children's National Medical Center developed a machine-learning algorithm capable of identifying Still's murmur with high accuracy (90% sensitivity, 99% specificity). To enable digital recording, essential for computerized murmur analysis, we also developed a digital stethoscope that connects to a smartphone and is equivalent in performance to a commercial stethoscope. Our envisioned product, called StethAid, is a combination of this novel digital stethoscope and a smartphone application (app). Having successfully met the Phase I performance milestones, we now propose to fully develop StethAid and conduct a multicenter trial through the following three specific aims: (1) develop and test a clinical-grade digital stethoscope, (2) develop fully feature software app, (3) conduct a multicenter trial of automated Still's murmur identification. For the multicenter trial, we have expanded our collaboration to include Boston Children's Hospital and Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. Our deliverable for Phase II is a technology platform validated by leading pediatric cardiologists that is ready for seeking regulatory approvals, deployment at PCP offices, and commercialization. As a decision support system, StethAid could empower PCPs to identify Still's murmur accurately and thus reduce the huge number of unnecessary specialist referrals. This should save the healthcare system hundreds of millions of dollars annually, allow pediatric cardiologists to focus on patients with serious conditions, and protect healthy children and their families from the unnecessary anxiety, inconvenience, and expense of seeing a pediatric cardiologist. PROJECT NARRATIVE Over half a million children are referred unnecessarily to pediatric cardiologists by general physicians for the evaluation of Still's murmur, a normal and harmless heart murmur. This project will develop and clinically validate a novel mobile technology for automated recognition of this murmur in order to reduce the current rate of such unnecessary referrals and associated costs and inconvenience.",Automated point-of-care identification of innocent Still's murmur in children,9680749,R42HL131081,"['Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Apple', 'Benign', 'Bluetooth', 'Boston', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Congenital Heart Defects', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hearing', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart Sounds', 'Heart murmur', 'Incidence', 'Legal patent', 'Libraries', 'Medical center', 'Military Personnel', 'Modeling', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sample Size', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Specialist', 'Specificity', 'Stethoscopes', 'Technology', 'Technology Transfer', 'Testing', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'care providers', 'classification algorithm', 'cloud based', 'commercialization', 'computerized', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mobile computing', 'new technology', 'novel', 'off-patent', 'pediatric cardiologist', 'performance tests', 'point of care', 'prototype', 'smartphone Application', 'sound', 'tool', 'wasting', 'web interface']",NHLBI,"AUSCULTECH DX, LLC",R42,2019,764643,0.06816117940819842
"Early understanding of multi-digit numbers Place value concepts and multi-digit numbers are the foundations of mathematics; however, many  children struggle at acquiring this knowledge. Poor understanding of the place value concepts has  been linked to difficulties in mathematics learning through the elementary and middle school  grades, and it is present not only for children with learning disabilities but also for a large  proportion of normally developing children. It is, thus, important to understand the developmental  mechanisms of multi-digit number learning and potential sources of early experiences that allow  some children to readily grasp the concepts while others continue to struggle. Recent research on place value concepts has suggested that children have partial knowledge of  multi-digit numbers at the preschool period, before receiving formal training from schools. These  precursors of multi-digit number knowledge can serve as important stepping-stones for children to  master the concept of place value once entering schools. However, there are at least two gaps in  our current understanding of the development  of place value concepts. First, how does early  understanding of multi-digit numbers relate to formal school training of the place value concepts?  Second, how do children come to acquire partial knowledge of multi-digit numbers at such a young  age in the first place? The goal of the proposed research aims at filling these gaps in the  literature with three specific aims. Aim 1 tests the hypothesis that early knowledge of multi-digit  numbers is predictive of later school learning of the place value concepts. I propose to conduct a  3-year longitudinal study to measure children’s early understanding of multi-digit numbers at the  start and end of kindergarten, 1st  and 2nd grades. The study will test how early knowledge of  number names and written numerals, as well as other individual difference measurements (e.g., age,  gender, SES, number sense, home exposures to numbers),  relate to the learning of base-10  principles in grade school. Aim 2 tests the hypothesis that acquiring early knowledge of  multi-digit numbers is a form of statistical learning, during which children extract latent  structures that govern the mapping between number words and written numerals through sparse  co-occurrence data. A training study is designed to give children casual experiences with  multi-digit numbers in engaging and child- friendly activities (e.g., picture-book reading, ipad  games). The same children in the statistical learning training will also be given formal school  training afterward, allowing us to assess and provide causal evidence for the hypothesis that early  knowledge prepares children for formal school training of the place value concepts. The knowledge  gained from this research will have implications for: a) determining the role of early knowledge of  multi-digit numbers in preparing children to learn about base-10 notation at schools; b) linking  statistical learning from sparse co-occurrence data about number words and multi-digit numbers to  early partial knowledge of place value; c) documenting how differences in early learning  environment (or input) may contribute to developmental inequalities in later school performances. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research aims at understanding the early development of multi-digit numbers, its learning mechanisms and its impact on formal school training of place value concepts. The period of development studied here, from 3 to 5 years of age, is a period during which sizable individual differences in multi-digit number knowledge starts to emerge, which may contribute to early developmental inequalities that limit the development of some children even after entering school. The proposed work is relevant to public health in that it will shed light on how differences in early learning environment lead to individual differences in early understanding of multi-digit numbers, potentially serving as the foundation for future early mathematical training programs.",Early understanding of multi-digit numbers,9567447,F32HD090827,"['5 year old', '6 year old', 'Age', 'Books', 'Child', 'Consequentialism', 'Correlation Studies', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Digit structure', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inequality', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Letters', 'Light', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Names', 'Nursery Schools', 'Only Child', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Preschool Child', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Work', 'base', 'design', 'early experience', 'educational atmosphere', 'elementary school', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'first grade', 'formal learning', 'grasp', 'junior high school', 'kindergarten', 'mathematical ability', 'mathematical learning', 'mathematics disability', 'second grade', 'socioeconomics', 'success']",NICHD,INDIANA UNIVERSITY BLOOMINGTON,F32,2019,59038,0.07681851940368907
"Towards noninvasive diagnosis of malaria PROJECT SUMMARY Plasmodium falciparum causes the deadliest form of malaria, which is responsible for nearly one million deaths annually. There is currently no perfect test to detect if a person has malaria. This is because all available tests have challenges and are all based on testing a blood sample. We have identified volatile organic compounds that are produced by the malaria parasite in culture. In a recent pilot study that was conducted in Lilongwe, Ma- lawi, we found that similar compounds are also present in the breath of children who have uncomplicated falci- parum malaria. We also observed a global change in the breath profile of children with malaria. The objectives of this proposal are to identify candidate biomarkers of malaria, with the long-term goal to develop a new non- invasive test to diagnose clinical malaria infection. Supported by our strong preliminary data that indicate that this strategy will be successful, our objectives will be met through two specific aims: 1) determine reproducible changes in the breath composition in response to malaria infection, in an independent location. 2) Relate breath changes with parasite development stages. Our approach is innovative, since we will enroll naturally infected children in the field. Children harbor the highest parasite and gametocyte densities. The proposed re- search is significant, because we will progress in development of new, much-needed malaria diagnostic tool that will not rely on blood samples. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research is highly relevant to public health because malaria kills many people worldwide each year. Our proposal will advance a new strategy to diagnose this infection, which may lead to improved malaria control efforts.",Towards noninvasive diagnosis of malaria,9725011,R21AI144472,"['Africa', 'Aftercare', 'Antimalarials', 'Area', 'Asia', 'Australia', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood specimen', 'Breath Tests', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Culicidae', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Exhalation', 'Falciparum Malaria', 'Gene Deletion', 'Global Change', 'Goals', 'HRP-2 protein', 'Health Campaign', 'Infection', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'Investments', 'Kenya', 'Laboratory Research', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Malawi', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Medical Research', 'Molecular', 'Nose', 'Parasitemia', 'Parasites', 'Parasitology', 'Persons', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Risk', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'breath composition', 'candidate marker', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'cost', 'density', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'experience', 'global health', 'improved', 'innovation', 'malaria infection', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'pediatric patients', 'portability', 'response', 'sensor', 'specific biomarkers', 'success', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'treatment response', 'volatile organic compound']",NIAID,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,297059,0.0696772742955796
"Development and Evaluation of an Evidence-Based Mobile Health Caregiver Intervention for FASD Project Summary/Abstract   Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) represent a major public health problem that affects up to 2 to 5  percent of school-­aged children in the US. Unfortunately, only a small fraction of children with FASD and their  families can access FASD-­informed interventions due to significant systems-­ and family-­level barriers.  Research suggests that self-­directed and peer-­to-­peer interventions are acceptable to families and can lead to  significant improvements in parenting, child behavior, and resource utilization. Advancements in technology  are facilitating more accessible and interactive methods for self-­directed education and support. The proposed  project will develop and evaluate the efficacy of a novel mobile health (mHealth) application (“app”) to directly  provide caregivers with evidence-­based content and peer-­moderated support they can easily access and use  to improve outcomes for their children and families. The app, currently called “FMF Connect,” will be derived  from the scientifically-­validated Families Moving Forward (FMF) Program and will build on existing frameworks  for the development of medical apps. This project will follow a systematic approach to the development and

larger-­scale hybrid implementation-­effectiveness trial (n=120) with caregivers raising children (ages 3-­12) with  FASD. Implementation data will aid in identifying the patterns of app usage that relate to the greatest  improvements in child and caregiver outcomes. Study hypotheses are: 1) that caregivers will find the FMF  Connect intervention acceptable, with easy to access content and encouraging support from peer-­moderators;;  2) that greater usage of specific intervention components will relate to larger improvements in child and  caregiver outcomes;; 3) that caregivers who receive the FMF Connect intervention will have larger gains on  child and caregiver outcomes relative to a waitlist comparison group;; and 4) that an increase in  neurodevelopmental attributions for behavior will mediate intervention-­related improvements in parenting  efficacy and child behavior. Project findings will guide further app development both in terms of content and

"Multi-Site Validation Study of the HLHS Arrest Predictor Each year in the US, there are thousands of children who are born with a severe congenital deformation, where one of the two ventricles in the heart is severely underdeveloped. If they survive infancy, these children can go on to live full and normal lives. The mortality rate for this condition is 15%, and 63% of these deaths are due to cardio-respiratory arrests. This alarming rate of arrest events persists despite vigilant ICU care with the best available intensive monitoring equipment. Our overall goal is to improve current patient monitoring systems by developing machine learning algorithms that can predict the onset of an arrest event, hours before it occurs. This early warning indication can be provided to nurses and doctors who can intervene to prevent these life-threatening events from occurring, improving outcomes for these critically ill children. Preliminary studies at Texas Children's Hospital have resulted in a computer algorithm that can estimate the odds of arrest in single ventricle children, 1-2 hours prior to overt symptoms. The algorithm is based on a logistic regression risk model, and was developed using over 55,000 hours of vital sign observations. The specific aims of the proposed research are: (1) To test the hypothesis that this computer algorithm can provide an early warning of arrest, with sufficient accuracy for clinical use across different clinical centers; (2) To understand the relationship between the risk score provided by this algorithm and other post- surgical complications that commonly occur in these children during the their hospitalization. Aim 1 is a multi-center study of this algorithm on a large, prospective, and independent cohort, in order to measure its true predictive performance. Performance metrics to be measured will be the ROC area and positive and negative likelihood ratios. This will help us determine the optimal threshold for the detection of an arrest event. Aims 2 focus on relating the risk of arrest to outcomes such as mechanical circulatory support, re-operation, arrhythmia, and necrotizing enterocolitis. Successful completion of these aims will result in the first clinically validated, real- time early warning system for anticipating acute arrest events in children with single ventricle physiology. The techniques and technologies developed in this work are immediately translatable to other diseases and conditions for both adults and children. Thousands of children each year are born in the US with only a single functional ventricle, putting them at substantial risk of acute cardiac arrest and ultimately death. This project will validate a new monitoring technology, developed at Texas Children's Hospital, which can predict the onset of arrest 1-2 hours before it occurs in this population. This technology will provide nurses and doctors the valuable time that they need to mitigate problems leading up to arrest before these problems become life threatening, improving the chance of survival for these critically ill children.",Multi-Site Validation Study of the HLHS Arrest Predictor,9728036,R01HL142994,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Behavior', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Colorado', 'Common Ventricle', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computers', 'Critically ill children', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Equipment', 'Event', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Heart Arrest', 'Heart Ventricle', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Infant', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lung', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Necrotizing Enterocolitis', 'Nurses', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Palliative Surgery', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Monitoring System', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatric cardiology', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Surgical complication', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'base', 'care providers', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'infancy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'news', 'operation', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'repaired', 'respiratory', 'validation studies']",NHLBI,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,573724,0.1279776550593257
"A Computational Biomechanical Airway Model for Obese Children at Risk for OSAS ABSTRACT Childhood obesity remains epidemic and is most prevalent in minorities. Obese children have a higher risk for developing obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) with an estimated prevalence of 50%, compared to the general pediatric population with a known prevalence of 2-4%. OSAS carries with it significant neurocognitive, cardiovascular, and metabolic derangements. Additionally, obese children do not respond well to treatment such as adenotonsillectomy or weight loss with residual OSAS exceeding 50%. Despite progress that has been made in recent years to understand the anatomical and functional attributes of OSAS in children, the precise mechanism leading to the disorder remains unknown in the majority of obese children, hindering the development of efficacious treatments. Thus, the overarching goal of this study is to implement state-of-the-art dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and image analytics using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and biomechanical modeling, to establish the biomechanical basis that leads to OSAS or protects from it, in naïve and treated children with obesity. NARRATIVE Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is a common and difficult to treat disorder in obese children and leads to significant medical consequences. We still do not understand why some obese children suffer from this disorder while other do not. The current study will use advance imaging analytical tools combined with biomechanical models to better understand the causes of the disorder and ways to improve outcomes of treatment in these children.",A Computational Biomechanical Airway Model for Obese Children at Risk for OSAS,9699521,R01HL130468,"['17 year old', '3-Dimensional', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Biomechanics', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body mass index', 'Breathing', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Continuous Positive Airway Pressure', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dilator', 'Disease', 'Drops', 'Epidemic', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intercept', 'Intervention', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Muscle', 'Nasopharynx', 'Neurocognitive', 'Obesity', 'Object Attachment', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Oropharyngeal', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Property', 'ROC Curve', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Sleep', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tonsil', 'Treatment outcome', 'analytical tool', 'awake', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'cardiometabolism', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved outcome', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'longitudinal design', 'non rapid eye movement', 'novel', 'obesity in children', 'pharyngeal critical pressure', 'pressure', 'respiratory', 'response', 'standard care', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,743544,0.09895461521146323
"Development and Validation of an Automated Measurement of Child Screen Media Use: FLASH The obesity field is fraught with problems of measuring people's diet, physical activity and sedentary behaviors that are hindering the advancement of the field to find promising solutions for obesity prevention and treatment. An important example is screen media use, a prominent cause for sedentary time that has been linked to obesity and metabolic syndrome, as well as other unwanted physiologic, psychosocial, and academic outcomes in children. Given the important impact screen use has on children's health, our ability to measure the time children spend on screens is very limited. Current assessments typically rely either on (1) general questions estimating “typical use;” or self- or parent-report via screen use diaries, both which have reporting bias and recall bias; or (2) devises initially intended to restrict children's TV viewing (TV Allowance™), which may have intervention effects or miss-classify TV viewing time. While automatic and objective measures of physical activity have shown validity and reliability for quantifying children's physical activity, no system that is automatic, accurate and unobtrusive has been developed to assess children's screen use on different platforms. Advances in technology, such as person detection, accurate facial recognition based on images, and imaging, computer vision and signal processing algorithms now offer novel and promising solutions to objectively and automatically measure people's screen viewing behaviors. We will leverage these recent advances and integrate them to develop a first of its kind, in-home, unobtrusive, automatic, privacy preserving screen use monitoring system: Family Level Assessment of Screen use in the Home (FLASH) that uses an embedded computing platform connected to a video camera on larger, stationary screens (FLASH-TV); or functions as a background app using a front facing camera (FLASH-Mobile). Our trans-disciplinary group, consisting of behavioral researchers at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) and electrical engineers at Rice University, propose to develop and asses the validity of the FLASH to accurately identify whether and for how long a child is using screen media devices. In this multiple-PI application, the development of FLASH is led by engineers at Rice. Once a final system has been developed, alpha and beta tested, a validation study will take place in observation labs by the BCM behavioral researchers with 6-10 year old children for FLASH-TV and FLASH-Mobile (n=43). Comparisons of FLASH output will be made to staff observations of children participating in a set of structured predefined activities. Next FLASH will be assessed for feasibility and accuracy for identifying children's screen use across platforms in a naturalistic home setting (n=46), compared to direct observation and screen use diaries. This project has the potential of creating a paradigm shift in scientist's ability to assess the role screen use has on health outcomes or intervention effects of screen media reduction programs, similar to that of accelerometers for physical activity research. FLASH has the potential of having a significant impact on public health and clinical research regarding screen media use.   PROJECT NARRATIVE Higher levels of screen media use have been associated with obesity, metabolic syndrome and other unwanted health and psychosocial outcomes in children. Despite the recent attention screen use has received among public health and clinical circles, the measurement of screen use behaviors is very crude and inaccurate. In this application, we propose to develop and assess the validity of an in-home objective, unobtrusive, automatic, privacy preserving screen use monitoring system, called FLASH that has the potential to revolutionize the measurement of screen use behaviors.",Development and Validation of an Automated Measurement of Child Screen Media Use: FLASH,9693725,R01DK113269,"['10 year old', 'Accelerometer', 'Algorithms', 'Asses', 'Attention', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Child Health', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Data Reporting', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diet', 'Documentation', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Engineering', 'Face', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Privacy', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Rice', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Structure', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Video Recording', 'Weight', 'Youth', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'behavioral outcome', 'college', 'computational platform', 'cost', 'diaries', 'field study', 'gaze', 'handheld mobile device', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'intervention effect', 'monitoring device', 'novel', 'obesity development', 'obesity in children', 'obesity prevention', 'obesity treatment', 'preservation', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'sedentary', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'signal processing', 'tv watching', 'validation studies']",NIDDK,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,515083,0.06252639336634973
"Images of Children and Adults for Health Research Abstract: This project's goal of expanding the extant archive for a major longitudinal study to include an innovative collection of images of children and adults is well-aligned with the initiative (PAR-16-149) to support the archiving of NICHD-funded data sets for secondary data analyses. The longitudinal study was funded through a U01 partnership with NICHD, and the images that will be added to its archive can take longitudinal and intergenerational health research in significantly new directions. As background, the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (SECCYD) was a major investment of NICHD in a longitudinal study of children and parents. The observational, survey, medical, biological, and video data from the NICHD- sponsored data collection over 15 years are archived at the Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR), with data collection on the now-adult sample ongoing. A current R01 project by the PIs of this proposal has developed a systematic process for extracting and rating “short slice” images of children and parents from videos. This system has resulted in short slices of children at 11 time points, short slices of mothers at four time points, and ratings of the attractiveness of their faces and bodies at all these time points. The child ratings—along with a detailed codebook—are already being added to the SECCYD archive through the current R01 so that health scholars licensed with ICPSR can merge them with the SECCYD for analyses of child and adolescent development. The proposed R03 would allow a substantial and valuable expansion by also archiving the actual short slices of children, extracting short slices of mothers at the remaining time points, extracting the short slices of fathers at the five time points they were videotaped, and adding all of these short slices to the archive along with expanded codebooks. The PIs are partnering with ICPSR to open up their secure system for housing and organizing these images so that other researchers could use them for their own purposes and not have to travel to the ICSPR data enclave. Such an enterprise would exploit the original R01 project to realize substantial economies of scale in creating a resource for health research to inform a wide array of health and health-relevant literatures. Indeed, a substantial body of research has documented the valid and reliable ways that images of the face and body can be used. For example, scholars could access this expanded SECCYD archive to examine the development of health conditions (e.g., obesity), the corrosive effects of disadvantage on health (e.g., the physical toll of poverty), the link between social stigmas and health (e.g., colorism and depression), family health dynamics (e.g., disjunctures in health of parents and children), and other important questions concerning individual and population health. They can also go beyond human rating to exploit new machine scoring techniques that enable measurements beyond the human eye that provide insights into biological processes (e.g., hormone levels, sexual dimorphism). The codebooks will also provide a template for other scholars to expand their own NIH-funded data collections or to launch new ones. Project Narrative In response to a NICHD funding opportunity on archiving datasets, this project will significantly contribute to a number of fields of health research by archiving an expansive longitudinal set of images of the faces and bodies of children and their parents over a 15 year period. With a secure system to facilitate ease of access and use, such images can be human rated (e.g., perceived age, weight, skin color) and machine scored (e.g., biologically informative facial measurements) to measure continuity and change in physical development and health and to capture the physical toll of the environment on individual wellbeing. Extending a prior NICHD- funded project that rated 11 waves of videos from the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development to longitudinally study children's appearance, this larger archive of images will provide a valuable resource for researchers aiming to conduct innovative research on health and health disparities.",Images of Children and Adults for Health Research,9745971,R03HD096203,"['Academic achievement', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent Development', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Appearance', 'Archives', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Birds', 'Birth', 'Catalogs', 'Child', 'Child Care', 'Child Development', 'Childhood', 'Collection', 'Color', 'Corrosives', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disadvantaged', 'Discipline', 'Documentation', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Family health status', 'Fathers', 'Funding', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grooming', 'Guidelines', 'Half-Life', 'Health', 'Health Resources', 'Health Status', 'Hormones', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Investments', 'Licensing', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Light', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Nose', 'Obesity', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Politics', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Rattus', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Secure', 'Services', 'Slice', 'Social Environment', 'Stress', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testosterone', 'Time', 'Travel', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Videotape', 'Visual', 'Walking', 'Weight', 'Weight Gain', 'base', 'data archive', 'experience', 'health disparity', 'image archival system', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intergenerational', 'middle age', 'population health', 'recruit', 'response', 'secondary analysis', 'sexual dimorphism', 'skin color', 'social', 'social engagement', 'social implication', 'social stigma', 'transmission process']",NICHD,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R03,2019,78706,0.07475073622402635
"Biomechanics and Walking in Cerebral Palsy: Ankle Foot Orthoses - Footwear Combinations Project Summary/Abstract: Ambulatory children with cerebral palsy (CP) demonstrate significant gait deviations (e.g., excessive hip/knee flexion in stance), which limits their walking activity and ability to physically participate in day to day life. Ankle Foot Orthoses (AFO) is a fundamental rehabilitation strategy to facilitate walking in children with CP; yet, efficacy in this population remains equivocal. The immediate positive effect of Ankle Foot Orthoses-Footwear Combinations (AFO-FC), a novel systematic decision tree for orthotic prescription for gait deviations in CP has been documented in the lab. Case series data has documented significant positive effects on gait speed, community walking activity and parent satisfaction for the AFO-FC. The underlying biomechanical mechanisms and clinical predictors of effect are unclear. The objective of this pilot study application is to examine the effect of AFO-FC on overall gait deviations and walking speed as compared to current AFO in children with CP. To identify potential biomechanical mechanisms, we will capture gait deviations during stance. We will examine the effect of the AFO-FC on balance, daily walking activity, physical activity and satisfaction. The premise of the AFO-FC approach, which incorporates a rigid AFO, is that individualized segment alignment and shoe modifications controls ankle movement and appears visually to enhance hip/knee extension during mid stance and commencement of terminal stance. We hypothesize that AFO-FC approach will decrease gait deviations in stance towards the alignment of typically developing children, which will positively affect gait speed, balance, community-based walking and physical activity. This hypothesis will be tested by the following specific aims. Aim 1: examine the effect of AFO-FC on overall gait deviations and walking speed as compared to current AFO in children with CP. We propose a randomized waitlist study of 22 ambulatory children with CP and bilateral barefoot midstance crouch gait, ages 4 to 9 years to compare currently prescribed AFO to the AFO- FC. Gait deviations and walking speed will be measured by instrumented three dimensional gait analyses. Aim 2: examine the effect of AFO-FC on daily walking activity, balance and satisfaction as compared to current AFO in children with CP Walking activity will be captured by the StepWatch accelerometer; balance with the Pediatric Balance Scale and physical activity and satisfaction through parental report questionnaires. This project is innovative because it focuses on a novel approach to individualized orthotic prescription employing a published decision tree in a heterogeneous population with a study design that leverages recruitment and retention. The proposed research is significant because it will be the first step in a continuum of research that is expected to direct orthotic prescription and rehab strategies across pediatric disabilities and positively effect changes in community-based walking activity for children with CP. Advances in the understanding of the biomechanical mechanisms by which children with CP respond to AFO-FC are expected with relevance to the health and functional benefits of enhanced mobility and physical activity across the life span. Project Narrative: The proposed project is relevant to public health because the discovery of effective clinical orthotic management strategies and underlying biomechanical mechanisms is expected to positively effect changes in community-based walking activity, balance, physical activity and function for children with CP. This knowledge will inform current and future orthotic rehabilitation interventions for persons with neuromotor limitations. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the NICHD’s mission pertaining to development of knowledge that ensures the health, productivity, independence and well-being of people through optimal rehabilitation.",Biomechanics and Walking in Cerebral Palsy: Ankle Foot Orthoses - Footwear Combinations,9772539,R21HD094823,"['Accelerometer', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Ankle', 'Bilateral', 'Biomechanics', 'Case Series', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Equinus Deformity', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Gait speed', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heel', 'Hip region structure', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Joints', 'Kinetics', 'Knee', 'Knowledge', 'Leg', 'Length', 'Life', 'Limb structure', 'Longevity', 'Lower Extremity', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modification', 'Movement', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Orthotic Devices', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Productivity', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized', 'Reaction', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Shoes', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Waiting Lists', 'Walking', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'crouch gait', 'disability', 'experience', 'foot', 'functional outcomes', 'gait examination', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved mobility', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'kinematics', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'orthotics', 'prosthesis wearer', 'recruit', 'rehabilitation strategy', 'satisfaction', 'therapy design', 'trial comparing', 'vector', 'walking speed']",NICHD,SEATTLE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2019,189743,0.0879835970264937
"Clinical validation of a novel handheld optical measurement system to enable 1-touch assessment of middle ear effusion in standard otoscopy Broader Impacts  More than 90% of children experience at least one ear infection before age 5, making ear infections among the most common childhood conditions. Family Physicians and Pediatricians see more than 20 million suspected ear infection cases per year in the US. Approximately 40% of these are misdiagnosed infections in healthy ears, leading to 6-9 million unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions annually. In fact, ear infection is the leading cause of unnecessary antibiotic use in children, resulting in hundreds of millions of dollars wasted and millions of children placed at undue risk for adverse side effects. On a societal level, unnecessary antibiotic use and resultant resistant microorganisms adds $20B in excess healthcare costs annually. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, American Academy of Pediatrics, and American Academy of Family Physicians have identified improved ear infection diagnostics as necessary to slow the spread of resistant microorganisms. Unfortunately, despite updated clinical guidelines dating back to 1994, no significant reduction in unnecessary prescription rates has been achieved.  Even a modest improvement in ear infection diagnosis has the potential to positively affect millions of children, save hundreds of millions in direct costs, and slow the evolution of resistant bacteria. Cactus invented Optical Tympanometry (OT) technology to improve ear infection diagnosis in primary care, where most cases are seen. Cactus technology is 98% accurate in a clinical study of 30 pediatric participants, and works in clean and waxy ears. Intellectual Merit  Children affected with ear infection are most often too young to adequately describe their symptoms. Signs of ear infections are numerous, but they are also very non-specific. Clinical diagnosis is most commonly done by assessing a set of qualitative factors using an otoscope to provide a magnified view of the ear drum. Most clinicians look for middle ear redness. However, redness alone is less than 65% accurate, matching accuracy statistics observed in primary care. The American Academy of Pediatrics and American Academy of Family Physicians recommend an objective quantitative assessment of the presence or absence of middle ear effusion (MEE). In fact, Key Action Statement 1C in the AAP’s most recent Acute Otitis Media (active ear infection requiring antibiotic treatment, AOM) guideline states:  Clinicians should not diagnose AOM in children who do not have middle ear effusion (MEE)  Currently, MEE is often unassessed due to technology limitations. Existing acoustic and pneumatic devices are slow, subjective and can be painful to children. As a result, clinicians commonly prescribe a course of antibiotics out of a preponderance of caution, or to placate parents. Cactus invented OT as a rapid, seamless means of assessing MEE during otoscopy. This SBIR Phase I proposal validates a miniaturized embodiment of OT (LED-OT) built into the familiar otoscope. Specific Aims Aim 1 (Month 0-2): Assembly and Repeatability & Reproducibility Study of LED-OT Otoscopes. Cactus has developed a patent pending (US62/675,056 & US161040195) LED-OT otoscope based on its innovative multiLED microchip, which houses all 13 wavelengths required for OT in a 6x6mm form factor. Cactus will assemble 6 LED-OT otoscope units for rigorous measurement repeatability and reproducibility assessment followed by clinical validation in Aims 2-3. Aim 2 (Month 2-12): Clinical Data Collection IRB approved (UCI HS#2016-3039) data collection will take place under the supervision of UC Irvine Professor Elliot Botvinick via a sub-award. Clinical data collection mirrors that used in 510(k) applications for previously cleared acoustic devices and enables receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis of LED-OT otoscopy. Aim 3 (Month 2-12): Clinical Data Analysis Clinical data analysis will be concurrent with data collection, with two specific goals. First, train OT’s statistical component. Second, validate performance of LED-OT in pediatric participants using ROC analysis. A successful outcome of this proposal will be validated LED-OT technology and 6 otoscopes prepared for a pivotal study in Phase II to compare LED-OT and acoustic methods in an office setting. Together, Phase I and II will prepare LED-OT for analytical and clinical trials necessary for a 510(k) application, encourage adoption of our revolutionary technology, and facilitate private investment and relationships with strategic partners. Project Narrative  Cactus Medical, LLC is developing a rapid, low-cost, non-invasive ear infection indicator to improve ear infection diagnosis in pediatric care settings. Cactus’ SmartScope will provide physicians with an accurate indication of ear infection at the press of a button while they are performing their normal inspection of the ear drum through an otoscope. SmartScope technology has shown 98% accuracy in a pediatric clinical study. This device has the potential to save $1.5 billion annually and reduce the rate at which anti-bacterial resistance evolves by limiting unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions and protect millions of children from unnecessary antibiotic treatment.",Clinical validation of a novel handheld optical measurement system to enable 1-touch assessment of middle ear effusion in standard otoscopy,9844869,R43DC018248,"['Academy', 'Acoustics', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Award', 'Back', 'Bacterial Drug Resistance', 'Cactaceae', 'Caring', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical assessments', 'Collection', 'Confidence Intervals', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Direct Costs', 'Ear', 'Evolution', 'Family Physicians', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Head', 'Health Care Costs', 'Infection', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Investments', 'Legal patent', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Oranges', 'Otitis Media', 'Otitis Media with Effusion', 'Otoscopes', 'Otoscopy', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatrics', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Privatization', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Readiness', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Redness', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Design', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Tube', 'Tympanic membrane', 'Tympanometry', 'Tympanostomy', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Waxes', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'bacterial resistance', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cost', 'design', 'ear infection', 'experience', 'flexible electronics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'microchip', 'microorganism', 'middle ear', 'miniaturize', 'novel', 'off-patent', 'pediatrician', 'professor', 'side effect', 'statistics', 'validation studies']",NIDCD,"CACTUS MEDICAL,LLC",R43,2019,224808,0.06490589990299944
"Predicting the early childhood outcomes of preterm brain shape abnormalities PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The last months of pregnancy are particularly important for the development of the child's brain, and the consequences of premature birth on its development can be substantial. Prematurely born children are at higher risk of various cognitive impairments and exhibits more behavioral disorders than full-term born children. Thus early detection and management of at risk children are essential. There is growing evidence of significant volumetric abnormalities in subcortical structures of premature neonates, which may be associated to negative long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. Understanding these abnormalities could help elucidate the underlying pathophysiology and enable early determination of at-risk patients, both of which would inform the design of novel treatment strategies. However, to date there is still a lack of sensitive, reliable, and accessible algorithms capable of characterizing the influence of prematurity on the anatomy of neonatal brain subcortical structures. In addition, few studies have looked directly at the long-term neurodevelopmental implications of these neonatal subcortical structures abnormalities. Predicting long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes early on – and preferably at neonatal ages – is likely to have a transformative effect on their outcome. Our preliminary data indicate significant morphological differences in the putamen, ventricles, corpus callosum, and thalamus between preterm and term neonates. We propose to develop biomarkers of prematurity by statistically comparing the morphological and diffusion properties of subcortical structures between preterm and term neonates using brain MRI. These results will further be used in a sparse learning framework to predict long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes of prematurity. Hypotheses: By combining subcortical morphological and diffusion properties, we will be able to: (1) delineate specific correlative relationships between structures regionally and differentially affected by normal maturation and different patterns of white matter injury, and (2) improve the specificity of neuroimaging to predict neurodevelopmental outcomes earlier. Aim 1: Build a new toolbox for neonatal subcortical structures analyses that combine 1) a group lasso-based analysis of significant regions of shape changes, 2) a structural correlation network analysis, 3) a neonatal tractography, and 4) tensor-based analysis on tracts. Aim 2: Ascertain biomarkers of prematurity in neonates with different patterns of abnormalities. Aim 3: Assess the predictive potential of imaging and clinical features on neurodevelopmental outcomes among premature children at 12 and 18 months and 6-8 years of age. Impact: This application will provide the first complete subcortical network analysis in both term and preterm neonates. In the first study of its kind for prematurity, we will use sparse and multi-task learning to determine which of the biomarkers of prematurity at birth are the best predictors of long-term outcome.

"Inflammation Phenotypes in Pediatric Sepsis Induced Multiple Organ Failure Renewal Carcillo R01 Project Abstract Every year over 1 million American adults and children develop overwhelming infection leading to a rotting of their body we call ‘sepsis’, and death in up to 1 of 3 afflicted (www.nigms.nih.gov>NIGMS Home>Science Education). National efforts emphasizing early recognition, intravenous fluids to help organs, and antibiotics to kill infection, have reduced mortality so that now 1 of 4 die. We and others have asked the question “why do patients continue to die despite these national efforts?’ In the previous funding period we showed in 401 children with sepsis that those who developed organ shut down despite these efforts, did so because they were a) unable to fight germs causing unending infection, b) unable to stop clotting off their body causing kidney failure, and/or c) unable to kill viruses causing liver failure; all of which led to death from uncontrolled inflammation with clotting, bleeding and liver failure. Fortunately, each of these organ shutdown groups has hopeful treatments. With the new information we collected in the previous funding period we have already designed and started clinical trials testing these treatments including immune boosters for children unable to kill germs, plasma removal and replacement using plasma exchange for children unable to stop clotting, monoclonal antibodies to kill viruses and their homes to reverse liver failure in children unable to do so on their own, and anti-inflammatory proteins to reverse uncontrollable inflammation, in hopes of helping save many of the 1 of 4 children still dying from sepsis related organ shutdown. In this next funding period, we propose to use the clinical information and samples already obtained in our previous study to take advantage of the wonderful advances made this millenia in computer technology, big data, bioinformatics, and the study of human and virus genetics to perform Specific Aim 1) use a ‘Watson’ like approach to ask the computer to help us figure out if the children with sepsis have any other causes of organ shutdown that we can help, Specific Aim 2) use an ‘Ancestry.com’-like or ‘23 and me’-like approach to identify ‘precision medicine’ therapies for causes of organ shutdown that we can treat on a patient by patient basis, and Specific Aim 3) use a bedside molecular biology test approach to identify individualized therapies to kill DNA viruses and reduce cytokine inflammation. We think that DNA viruses are the unappreciated co-infection which causes uncontrolled cytokine inflammation and leads to organ shutdown. Our long term objective is to plan ‘precision’ medicine and ‘individualized’ medicine clinical trials testing therapies on an individual patient basis in order to further reduce death from sepsis organ shutdown in children. Carcillo R01 Narrative Statement Every year over 1 million American adults and children develop overwhelming infection leading to a rotting of their body we call ‘sepsis’, and death in up to 1 of 4 afflicted (www.nigms.nih.gov>NIGMS Home>Science Education). In our previous funding period we showed that this occurs when groups of patients are unable to kill germs, stop clotting or bleeding, or stop viruses from reproducing, and we have therefore designed and begun clinical trials to help these children do so.

"Parsing early emerging heterogeneity related to autism spectrum disorder A major impediment to early identification and intervention for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is our limited understanding of how different children present signs as toddlers, including what risk symptoms coincide across multiple dimensions to predict outcome. Our objectives are to quantify behavioral and brain connectivity based subtypes of risk that model the variability of ASD symptom expression in a community sample of toddlers. We will then test the predictive validity of this approach in the same cohort of children at three years of age in order to identify risk profiles that differentially predict later cognitive, behavioral, and clinical features. First, we will implement two unsupervised data-driven computational approaches in a community sample of 3000 children between 18-24 months old in order to characterize clusters of risk profiles. We hypothesize that each approach will identify a proportion of high-risk individuals consistent with epidemiological estimates of ASD and associated developmental disabilities (e.g., language or global DD). Based on our preliminary data, we anticipate that ~300 children will be identified by these data-driven risk-profiling methods. We also hypothesize that distinct patterns of structural and functional connectivity will distinguish groups of at-risk children and that these groups will differ from low-risk children. All children will be scanned with the same brain imaging sequences and procedures implemented in the Baby Connectome Project and will be compared to data from 100 low-risk children from that project. Our neuroimaging sample of 300 children will be reassessed at age three with direct clinical assessment using gold-standard diagnostic instruments as well as parent report. This will allow us to validate the risk profiling approach implemented at 18-24 months, to compare with a current screening approach, and to refine the risk profiling approach with supervised training of prediction algorithms that incorporates behavioral/clinical outcome data. We expect this method for risk stratification/subtyping to better model the heterogeneity inherent to the early at-risk and resilient phenotypes, which will subsequently improve early identification/diagnosis efforts. These outcomes will have translational impact because improved methods for early identification in ASD are necessary for the successful development of efficacious, personalized early interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Symptoms of autism present differently in toddlers, which makes it difficult to identify children at risk during their first two years of life. Our goal is to measure variation in behavior and brain functioning in this age that may predict differing clinical outcomes. Identifying different subtypes of risk will later help us develop individually-optimized clinical recommendations for children with autism and related disorders.",Parsing early emerging heterogeneity related to autism spectrum disorder,9662003,R01MH115046,"['3 year old', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Disabilities', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Life', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Stratification', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Toddler', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'case control', 'case-based', 'clinically actionable', 'cohort', 'communication behavior', 'connectome', 'design', 'early screening', 'follow up assessment', 'high risk', 'improved', 'instrument', 'learning algorithm', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome prediction', 'population based', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive test', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'repetitive behavior', 'screening', 'social communication', 'symptomatology', 'translational impact', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2019,802904,-0.0488415215981188
"Anatomic biomarkers of chronic kidney disease progression among children Progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in childhood is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, metabolic bone disease, and death. Congenital abnormalities of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT), including posterior urethral valves, account for 50-60% of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in children and are the most common cause of ESRD in this age group. In children with CAKUT, kidney injury is often already established at birth due to renal dysplasia. Some children, however, maintain preserved kidney function into adulthood while others progress to ESRD in childhood. Our ability to effectively implement therapies to slow CKD progression is limited by our lack of understanding of which patients are at greatest risk for CKD progression and therefore would be most likely to benefit from early intervention. Thus there is a need for biomarkers that can identify children with CAKUT early in life who are at high risk of future CKD progression. To identify children with CAKUT early in life who are at high risk of future CKD progression, we will develop novel computational methods to derive clinically informative biomarkers from ultrasound (US) imaging data using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and effectively integrate them with established clinical measures for early prediction of CKD progression. To achieve reliable and accurate kidney segmentation, Aim 1 develops an automatic kidney segmentation method by adopting fully CNNs, conditional random fields, and active contour models to simultaneously learn informative high-level image features and inter-voxel relationship under shape regularizations to improve the segmentation accuracy and robustness to imaging noise. To achieve improved prediction of CDK progression based on US imaging data, deep CNNs will be adopted to learn informative imaging features in a multi-instance learning framework to predict which children with CAKUT will develop CKD progression and their timing of progression in Aim 2. These techniques will be applied to a dataset of patients followed at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, in order to derive individualized predictive indices of CKD progression. The proposed new techniques will allow us to early differentiate patients with distinct disease progression patterns.

"Evaluation of machine learning to mobilize detection and therapy of developmental delay in children Project Summary Access to diagnosis of autism and to invaluable early interventional therapy is severely hampered by the imbalance between the number of children needing care and the inadequate number of clinical practitioners who can deliver that care. This numerical imbalance is unlikely to change in the near future, and therefore there is an urgent need and an exciting opportunity to innovate new methods of care delivery that can appropriately empower caregivers of children at risk for or with a diagnosis of autism, and that capitalize on mobile tools and wearable devices. Using machine learning and large-scale data mining, we have built a mobile system to quantify and track the severity of autism that takes only minutes of a caregiver’s time and that has promise for repeat use at home due to its speed, accuracy and mobility. We have concomitantly developed a machine-learning system for automatic facial expression recognition that runs on Google Glass and delivers real time social cues to individuals with autism in that child’s natural environment. Our goal in this research program is to work with our clinical colleagues at Stanford’s Autism Center to test and refine these complementary machine-learning systems for accuracy and optimal use by families and their child with autism from their natural environments. We will then combine the two systems in a multi-month longitudinal trial designed to harness our mobilized machine learning tool to quantitatively measure the efficacy of our Autism Glasses as a therapeutic assistant that functions in real time and within the child’s natural environment. Our proposed experiments with at least 40 subjects at risk for developmental delay promise to demonstrate how to leverage digital health technologies to improve, mobilize and quicken the detection and treatment of autism. The work also will result in a new and unique dataset that validates the ability to bring the social learning process outside of the clinic and into the real world, leading to a faster, more fluid way for children with autism to gain social skills. We also expect our work to show how measurable indicators of behavioral improvement during therapy will facilitate the process of tracking progress on an increasingly more granular scale, and hopefully set the stage for more effective, precise and personalized treatment. Project Narrative There is a growing and striking imbalance between the number of clinical care providers and the number of children at risk for or managing an autism diagnosis, creating an urgent need to innovate new methods of care delivery that can appropriately empower caregivers and that capitalize on mobile tools and wearable devices. Our research proposal is focused on building two complementary machine learning tools – one for rapid, mobile measurement of the autism phenotype and one for at-home social learning on Google Glasses – that we believe will open the diagnostic bottleneck and provide a valuable form of behavioral therapy that can be used at home and outside of the clinical setting.",Evaluation of machine learning to mobilize detection and therapy of developmental delay in children,9524706,R21HD091500,"['Address', 'Age', 'Android', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Developmental Therapeutics Program', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Intervention', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Expression Recognition', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Technology', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Liquid substance', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Operating System', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Running', 'Schedule', 'Self-Direction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Work', 'behavior measurement', 'care delivery', 'care providers', 'clinical care', 'data archive', 'data mining', 'design', 'digital', 'experimental study', 'handheld equipment', 'human-in-the-loop', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'intervention program', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'prototype', 'social', 'social learning', 'social skills', 'stem', 'tool', 'trial design', 'wearable device']",NICHD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,235500,-0.014186203677752432
"LemurDx - Objectivity,  precision, and clinical utility in hyperactivity measurement for childhood ADHD using smartwatches and machine learning algorithms. Project Summary / Abstract ADHD is the most common behavioral diagnosis in early childhood, affecting around 5% of all American children. Although hyperactivity is a core symptom of ADHD, there are no objective measures that are widely used in practice settings. LemurDx is a concept for a software system for smartwatches and mobile tablets, optimized for clinical use, that uses state-of-the-art, yet relatively low-cost, sensor technology to measure hyperactivity, with the clinical goal of differentiating children with ADHD-hyperactive presentation or ADHD combined presentation from children with typical levels of activity. LemurDx will passively collect data from smartwatch sensors. Clinicians will ask a child to wear a smartwatch with the LemurDx application for one day and then collect the de-identified data. The data will be transmitted to a HIPAA-compliant secure server. Machine learning (ML) algorithms will be used to differentiate children with clinical levels of hyperactivity from those with typical levels of activity, providing clinicians with immediate results. LemurDx is superior to research-focused tools such as traditional actigraphy in a number of ways. Along with the improved precision afforded by modern smartwatch sensors (many of which are not available on actigraphy devices) and machine learning (ML) algorithms, the team is carefully designing a complete system based on the unique needs of clinicians. This includes a comprehensive system of secure HIPAA-compliant servers, automated state-of-the- art ML algorithms, pre-programmed mobile tablets and smartwatches for clinical use, a secure and de- identified data architecture, and a simple user interface that eliminates any technological burden on clinicians. Aim 1 of the project is to develop a commercial grade prototype of LemurDx following principles of user- centered design, with feedback from focus groups including children, parents, and clinicians. Aim 2 of the project is to test the feasibility of collecting, storing, and analyzing data from 30 children (ages 6-11) who will wear a smartwatch with LemurDx technology for one day. Aim 3 of the project is to test and refine several ML algorithms to achieve a high level of sensitivity and specificity to accurately classify children with and without ADHD. LemurDx is significant as there is no objective and commercially available measure of hyperactivity to assist in the diagnosis of ADHD, despite a great need in settings including pediatric primary-care practices, children’s hospitals, and behavioral health clinics. The project is consistent with NICHD’s mission to ensure, “that all children have the chance to achieve their full potential for healthy and productive lives.” Innovations include a combination of reliable, inexpensive measurement technology combined with accurate ML algorithms to consistently and objectively measure hyperactivity in a system that is designed for clinical users. We will show that LemurDx has commercialization potential by demonstrating accuracy, cost effectiveness, and user adherence, and will lay the foundation for the development of a scalable clinical delivery system. Project Narrative ADHD is the most common behavioral diagnosis in early childhood affecting around 5% of all American children. Although hyperactivity is a core symptom of ADHD, there are no objective measures that are widely used in practice settings that can assist in accurate diagnostics. This project will develop a prototype for a software system for smartwatches to measure hyperactivity with objectivity and precision using state-of-the-art sensors and machine learning algorithms.","LemurDx - Objectivity,  precision, and clinical utility in hyperactivity measurement for childhood ADHD using smartwatches and machine learning algorithms.",9558075,R41MH119644,"['Adherence', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Architecture', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavioral', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Consumer Satisfaction', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Hour', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Online Systems', 'Parents', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Primary Health Care', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Secure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Universities', 'actigraphy', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'commercialization', 'computer human interaction', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'early childhood', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'practice setting', 'product development', 'prototype', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'societal costs', 'software systems', 'standardize measure', 'stimulant abuse', 'success', 'teacher', 'tool', 'usability', 'user centered design', 'wearable technology']",NIMH,NURELM E-BUSINESS SOFTWARE,R41,2018,221917,0.08999384803237001
"Development of clinical decision tools for management of diarrhea of children in high and low resource settings Abstract Diarrheal diseases are the among the leading cause of death in children worldwide, most of which occur in low-income countries. In high-income countries, pediatric diarrhea remains a major utilization of healthcare resources. Treatment of diarrhea is mostly empiric, with antibiotic use mostly based on clinical suspicion for bacterial causes. However, the majority of cases of diarrhea do not benefit from antibiotic use, and inappropriate use leads to toxicity and resistance. Furthermore, despite the increasing availability of rapid molecular testing, there is little data to base a decision of whom or when to test. Our overarching goal is to develop and validate clinical decision tools for management of diarrheal illnesses in children of both high and low resource settings. We will utilize prospectively-collected data from two recently-completed multicenter cohort studies of pediatric diarrhea. These studies feature extensive etiologic testing, well-characterized clinical elements, and longitudinal outcome data. We have assembled a team with expertise in pediatric diarrhea, clinical prediction rules, and machine learning methods. In Aim 1, we will use domestic data to develop and validate: a) a score for bacterial etiology, and b) a score for which patients are likely to benefit from further testing. We will derive the scores using data from IMPACT, an NIH-sponsored study of 1200 children from 5 US Emergency Departments, and validate using electronic health records from the Utah Intermountain Health System. In Aim 2, we will use international data to develop and validate: a) a diagnostic score for bacterial etiology, and b) a prognostic score for risk stratification of children who go on to poor outcomes. We will derive the scores using data from GEMS, a study of over 9400 children across 7 low-resource countries, and validate using VIDA study of children in 3 African countries. Completion of the Aims will result in the availability of a number of clinical tools that healthcare workers worldwide can use for evidence-based care of children with diarrhea. Project Narrative Diarrheal diseases are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children worldwide. The management of childhood diarrhea often depend on what type of pathogen is responsible, but in many cases testing is not affordable or feasible. We propose studies to develop clinical scores to make it easier for healthcare workers to decide how to manage children with diarrhea.",Development of clinical decision tools for management of diarrhea of children in high and low resource settings,9596046,R01AI135114,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Accounting', 'Acute', 'Africa', 'African', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Antigens', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Biological Assay', 'Case Management', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Care', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cost Effective Management', 'Country', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diarrhea', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Enteral', 'Etiology', 'Feces', 'Gastroenteritis', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health Personnel', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Income', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Minority', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Diagnostic Techniques', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Pathogen detection', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Resistance', 'Resistance development', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Sample Size', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Utah', 'Vaccines', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'clinical development', 'clinical diagnostics', 'evidence base', 'health care service utilization', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'low and middle-income countries', 'low income country', 'microbial', 'molecular diagnostics', 'mortality', 'outcome prediction', 'pathogen', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'tool']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2018,457033,0.1177269173877149
"Quantitative Handwriting Assessment Tool for Healthy and Impaired Children No technology currently exists for objective assessment of handwriting, even though over 3 million individuals in the United States suffer from disorders that affect handwriting, including 2.7 million children with dyspraxia and over 300,000 older adults with Parkinson's disease. This lack of assessment technology creates a barrier to effective care, because occupational therapists cannot easily distinguish motor disorders from non- motor causes of handwriting disability, a necessary step toward developing appropriate treatment plans. Our goal is to develop Write to Hand, the first quantitative digital assessment of the motor skills that underlie handwriting.  In partnership with Washington University in St. Louis, PlatformSTL is uniquely suited to address the handwriting assessment gap. Our team is led by a neuroscientist who developed the Precision Drawing Task, a laboratory research tool with an established history of successful assessment and training of writing-related motor skills. The Precision Drawing Task will serve as the basis for Write to Hand. Our Phase I objective is to develop a fully functional prototype of Write to Hand, and demonstrate scientific validity in children grades 4-5. Data analysis will include an initial application of a machine learning approach, which will test its feasibility in advance of its primary role in Phase II.  Aim 1 of this STTR is to develop the Write to Hand iPad app, which must meet seven specific criteria including: high-precision data collection with a fine-point stylus; rapid calculation of movement speed, smoothness, straightness, and error rate; and data anonymization that meets HIPAA and IRB standards. Aim 2 will demonstrate validity by comparing Write to Hand performance against a handwriting benchmark in 56 children grades 4-5. We expect that movement smoothness will significantly and meaningfully (r2 > 0.25) predict handwriting skill, and we will use a machine learning approach (Generalized Factorial Method) determine the most predictive classifier for handwriting skill, identify task features that optimize handwriting prediction, and demonstrate feasibility of our machine learning approach to characterize and classify Write to Hand data.  Our product will transform therapy for individuals with handwriting disabilities, by providing educators, therapists, and researchers with a gold standard for assessment and quantification of handwriting's underlying motor control skills. This will, for the first time, allow objective identification of motor impairment in local and tele-health settings. In Phase II we will collect data across participant ages to train our machine learning algorithm so Write to Hand can label performance with easy-to-interpret grade level ratings. Our commercialization plan focuses on occupational therapists and educators who serve children with motor disabilities. Therapists currently have no objective tools to measure handwriting in children or impaired adults. This project will develop an iPad app to measure the movement skills that support effective handwriting. With this tool, therapists will be able to identify when handwriting disability arises from a movement problem, and develop treatment plans accordingly.",Quantitative Handwriting Assessment Tool for Healthy and Impaired Children,9679822,R41HD097833,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Apraxias', 'Area', 'Assessment tool', 'Benchmarking', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Collection', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Face', 'Fingers', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hand', 'Handwriting', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intuition', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Research', 'Learning', 'Linear Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Motor', 'Motor Skills', 'Movement', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Occupational Therapist', 'Paper', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'School-Age Population', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Societies', 'Speed', 'Standardization', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Upper Extremity', 'Washington', 'Writing', 'analytical method', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'commercial application', 'commercialization', 'design', 'digital', 'disability', 'elementary school', 'falls', 'innovation', 'motor control', 'motor disorder', 'motor impairment', 'prototype', 'skills', 'teacher', 'telehealth', 'tool', 'treatment planning']",NICHD,"NEWVENTUREIQ, LLC",R41,2018,240711,0.03829563261889464
"An Automated Early Motor Development Risk Screener from Observational Video Recordings of Infants and Toddlers Motor development plays a pivotal role in an infant’s overall development and has a cascading effect on social, cognitive, memory, and language ability. These functions can be compromised when motor development is disrupted; motor disruption is associated with generalized developmental delays. Early screening and identification of delays can allow early interventions with the goal of not just improving motor function but overall development in other domains. Experience with independent or motorized crawling is shown to improve spatial memory in infants. Active motor training, even as early as 3 months, is shown to achieve gains in object exploration and social engagement that persist long after the training sessions, indicating the benefits of early intervention. Children who get developmental screening are more likely to be identified with delays and receive early intervention services compared to those that only receive age-appropriate milestone checks as part of pediatric well-child visits. However, comprehensive motor screening, using standardized instruments, for developmental surveillance is labor intensive and requires specialized training in administration and evaluation. Shortage of resources to perform frequent, gold-standard, comprehensive motor assessments can lead to missed opportunities for early intervention and contribute negatively to lifelong outcomes for infants at risk for behavioral and developmental disorders. In the US, 15-20% of children have a developmental or behavioral disability, but less than a third of them get diagnosed before entering school, preventing opportunities for early intervention during a critical period of brain development. In Phase I, we built a prototype Human Action Recognition Engine (HARE) to automate extraction of infant motor movement from video; then utilized this engine to demonstrate the feasibility of an automated developmental risk screener by leveraging recent advances in machine learning to achieve state of the art accuracies in assessment of infant motor development. In Phase II, we aim to build out the risk screener, SCOREIT, as a clinically deployable, cost-effective, developmental risk assessment tool to identify children who need further clinical follow-up. SCOREIT has the potential to transform early developmental screening by bringing the power of comprehensive motor screening, usually administered only to at-risk children utilizing specialized resources, to underserved and economically-fragile communities. Less than a third of US children receive developmental screening. SCOREIT can bring risk screenings to the over 70% of children that currently do not receive them, increasing opportunities for early intervention for behavioral and developmental disorders. Additionally, the HARE system’s ability to automatically extract and quantify motor movements from video can be an enabler for explorations of early markers for behavioral and developmental disorders, significantly easing manual video coding burdens and accelerating the pace of discoveries. This proposal introduces an automated, portable, low-cost developmental risk assessment tool, SCOREIT, that leverages advances in machine learning to extract motor movements from infant videos and generate a motor developmental score based on a standardized instrument (Alberta Infant Motor Scale; AIMS). SCOREIT has the potential to transform early developmental risk screening by bringing the power of standardized, comprehensive motor screening to underserved, economically-fragile communities, and increase opportunities for early intervention of developmental disorders.",An Automated Early Motor Development Risk Screener from Observational Video Recordings of Infants and Toddlers,9558014,R44HD095783,"['Address', 'Age', 'Alberta province', 'American', 'Assessment tool', 'Back', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Catalogs', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Coordination Disorders', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Evaluation', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Infant', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Occupational Therapy', 'Parents', 'Pediatrics', 'Phase', 'Physical therapy', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Questionnaires', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Screening procedure', 'Services', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Stream', 'Supination', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Video Recording', 'Visit', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cognitive performance', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'critical period', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'developmental disease', 'disability', 'early screening', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infant outcome', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'learning network', 'motor function improvement', 'portability', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'service intervention', 'social', 'social engagement', 'spatial memory', 'tool']",NICHD,"BSOLUTIONS, INC.",R44,2018,605627,0.011425353343173468
"Genotype-Phenotype Associations in Reading Disorders Project Summary/Abstract  Dyslexia and other language-based reading disorders (RD) account for nearly 85% of children receiving special education services in the U.S. RD affect between 5% and 17% of school-age children with boys at higher risk than girls. Children with RD are at high risk for academic failure and future underemployment. The current diagnosis of RD relies on behavioral symptoms. This means that RD cannot be identified until after the child has begun to learn to read. By this time, a potentially opportune window for intervention has been missed. Early identification and prevention is possible by using genetic markers because RD have a high heritability rate. The existing genetic studies about RD are limited in the sense that the gene-RD association was evaluated on a one-gene-at-a-time basis. This approach is not efficient because hundreds of thousands of genes need to be evaluated; nor is it effective because it runs a high risk of miss-detecting important genes due to overly-strict multiple test corrections applied to too many genes. Also, the existing one-gene-at-a-time approach only examines the marginal association of each gene with RD, without accounting for the joint effect of multiple genes and their interaction in relation to RD. For a complex phenotype like RD, a multi-gene- interactive mechanism is more plausible and has been supported by recent studies. Despite this, little research has been done to discover the genes simultaneously and characterize their interactions. This is partially because this field has not been able to take advantage of modern machine learning developments that provide effective and efficient approaches for genetic big data modeling and analysis. Another limitation of the existing studies is that they have been focused on single behavioral deficits and did not account for demographic difference. The short-term goals for this proposed project are to identify the gene sets associated with RD, link the gene sets to enriched functional biological pathways, characterize the gene-RD associations across the behavioral deficits in multiple reading abilities and accounting for demographic differences, and validate the findings using existing population-based datasets. These goals will be achieved using a combination of advanced machine learning algorithms and pathway analyses that are applied to existing population-based RD data sources. There are two specific aims: Aim 1 focuses on identification of significant genes and their interactions in relation to RD using sparse machine learning models and pathway analysis; Aim 2 focuses on validation for the models and findings in Aim 1 using the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) dataset and another independent dataset. The long-term goal of this research is to contribute to the development of personalized early identification methods and early intervention for children at risk of RD. Project Narrative - Public Health Relevance Children with reading disorders account for up to 17 percent of the school-age population, and are at greater risk for underachievement in school, underemployment, and related mental health problems.

"A DATA SCIENCE APPROACH TO AIR TOXICS AND CHILDREN'S ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PROJECT SUMMARY: This proposal aims to characterize the associations between prenatal exposure to interpretable combinations of air toxics and children’s cognitive health through the efficient use of big public health data. With guidance from multidisciplinary advisors, the candidate will develop skills in data science, machine learning and advanced biostatistics to supplement her training in epidemiologic methods. This will allow her to progress in her career and advance research on combined environmental exposures and children’s health. Previous research has found associations between prenatal exposure to single air pollutants and children’s cognitive health but has lacked the ability to investigate combined impacts of multiple pollutants, including the synergistic/antagonistic interactions between pollutants that have been observed in experimental studies. Understanding the effects of combined exposures is a strategic goal of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, and the field of environmental health is transitioning from single-pollutant approaches to more holistic paradigms, such as the exposome. Identifying associations and interactions within the context of high-dimensional exposure data presents a computational challenge. Methods from domains such as data science, including machine learning methods, can be incorporated into the epidemiologic toolbox for addressing environmental mixtures and multiple exposures. The goal of this Career Development Award is to advance the candidate into an independent research career at the intersection of big data science and children’s environmental health. Through formal coursework, directed learning and field rotations, the candidate will gain skills in data science, machine learning and advanced biostatistics. Mentors, advisors and consultants have been selected for their complementary expertise, relevant research experience and mentoring abilities. The proposed research will leverage the skills gained from the training plan and apply them to characterize associations between prenatal exposure to interpretable combinations of air toxics and 3rd grade standardized test scores, a school-based measure of cognitive outcomes. Residence at birth will be used to link data on air toxics, a subset of air pollutants, to an administrative data linkage of public health registries and education data for approximately 220,000 children born in New York City from 1994-1998. The candidate will develop and validate a two-stage approach of hypotheses generation followed by targeted analyses in order to identify combinations of air toxics associated with children’s test scores within the context of high-dimensional exposure data (Aim 1).

However, most of the previous studies characterized exposure using a single pollutant, even though ambient air is a complex mixture. This study will identify the combined effects of prenatal exposure to multiple air pollutants on children's standardized test scores within a large, representative population of urban children.",A Data Science Approach to Air Toxics and Children's Environmental Health,9517056,K99ES027022,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Air Pollutants', 'Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Monitoring', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Linkages', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development Plans', 'Distal', 'Education', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Information Systems', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'New York City', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Rotation', 'Schools', 'Selection Bias', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Technical Expertise', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Urban Population', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'early life exposure', 'epidemiological model', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'forest', 'genome wide association study', 'health data', 'high dimensionality', 'learning strategy', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurodevelopment', 'pollutant', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'research and development', 'residence', 'skills', 'third grade', 'urban children']",NIEHS,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,K99,2018,98444,0.04501189797897044
"Data-driven multidimensional modeling of nonverbal communication in typical and atypical development ABSTRACT This proposal will develop innovative technology for data-driven, multimodal characterization of nonverbal communication (NVC) in typical and atypical development. Prior research has provided qualitative descriptions of the development of children's use of gaze and gesture to regulate social interactions, but there are no objective, automated tools for measuring NVC behaviors, nor computational models to explain their coordination and timing in social interactions. This proposal will apply advanced probabilistic modeling techniques from machine learning and data mining to a rich corpus of children's behavior, including automated measures of children's posture, head pose, gaze direction, arm movements, and hand configurations derived from color and depth cameras and accelerometers. By automatically learning probabilistic latent variable models from movement data, we will obtain compact, data-driven descriptions of NVC and its coordination in children with autism, children with developmental delays without autism, and typically developing children (Aim 1). We will validate our models by demonstrating their ability to predict children's behavior, including diagnostic group and one-year language outcomes (Aim 2). We will test whether novel NVC patterns can be uncovered with bottom-up clustering of motor movement data (Aim 3). We predict our models will have greater explanatory and predictive power compared to current measures of NVC, which are typically human-coded behaviors that are descriptive, but rely on a-priori definitions of higher level behaviors. The models we develop will capture the fine-grained structure, coordination, and timing of NVC behaviors during social interactions, and thus allow us to characterize these behaviors with an unprecedented level of detail. Because interventions for young children with ASD target NVC skills, our automated measurement tools will provide clinicians with powerful new tools to assess the extent to which these treatments are efficacious. In addition, automated tools for dense measurement of fine-grained changes in NVC would enable clinicians to assess profiles of strengths and weaknesses for purposes of treatment planning, to dynamically tailor treatment to clients' changing abilities, and ultimately to accurately capture whether treatment is working. Finally, the measurement capabilities will provide researchers with a novel, cost-effective approach to analyze video recordings, at a scale that is not currently feasible due to a reliance on human coding.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) affects 1 in 68 children in the US. This project is focused on developing automated tools to characterize behaviors considered to be core, early emerging markers of autism, and that represent common treatment targets in this group. This has clear implications for identifying those at risk for autism and for ongoing clinical care.",Data-driven multidimensional modeling of nonverbal communication in typical and atypical development,9596160,R01MH114999,"['Accelerometer', 'Affect', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Child', 'Child Behavior', 'Child Development', 'Client', 'Code', 'Color', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnostic', 'Face', 'Future', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Nonverbal Communication', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Posture', 'Production', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Social Interaction', 'Statistical Models', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Video Recording', 'Visit', 'Wrist', 'arm movement', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'clinical care', 'common treatment', 'communication behavior', 'cost effective', 'data mining', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'gaze', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovative technologies', 'joint attention', 'learning strategy', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'sensor', 'skills', 'social communication', 'tool', 'treatment planning']",NIMH,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2018,405254,0.001720217378158229
"The Home Evaluation, Assessment, Rating and Training of Gait (HEART-Gait) System for Monitoring Toe-Walking Severity in Children with Cerebral Palsy 1 Project Summary  2 Cerebral Palsy (CP) is a group of disorders attributed to non-progressive alterations occurring in the brain dur-  3 ing fetal and newborn development. These alterations affect movement, development and posture, causing  4 significant lifetime functional limitations. CP is the most common motor disorder in children, affecting 500,000  5 individuals in the US alone. Children with CP are commonly affected by gait impairments. One of the most  6 common impairments is equinus gait, or “toe-walking”, which is characterized by predominantly plantarflexed  7 feet during the whole gait cycle. Different interventions are available to treat equinus gait in children with CP  8 and include physical therapy, orthoses, botulinum toxin injections and surgery. To determine which intervention  9 is most appropriate to restore mobility for a given patient, periodic gait evaluations are performed in the clinic. 10 This Phase I SBIR proposal will develop a wearable system (Home Evaluation, Assessment, Rating and Train- 11 ing of Gait, HEART-Gait system) that continuously monitors and analyses simple gait parameters in children 12 with CP outside the clinical laboratory and during normal daily activities, which will provide clinically useful out- 13 comes data not currently available and critical diagnostic data for determining intervention timing. With access 14 to continuous data, the medical team is better informed and can effectively plan treatment, thus improving the 15 quality of care and the lives of children with CP and their families. Specific Aims are 16 Aim 1. Develop working prototype of HEART-Gait: Milestones are: 17 MS1: Veristride will optimize sensor selection and placement; construct prototype data acquisition hardware, 18 firmware and software. Months 1-2. 19 Aim 2. Iteratively design HEART-Gait system: Milestones are: 20 MS2: Veristride and the Spaulding team will work closely to modify the prototype system to make it suitable for 21 monitoring toe-walking in children with CP. Months 2-5. 22 MS3: The Spaulding team will interview 10 clinicians (unaffiliated with the project) and 10 families (guardians 23 and children) to gather their feedback about the HEART-Gait system. Months 2-5. 24 Aim 3. Evaluate the feasibility of HEART-Gait: Milestones are: 25 MS4: The Spaulding team will recruit 20 children (5-12 years) with CP and toe-walking pattern. Data will be 26 collected simultaneously from HEART-Gait and camera-based motion capture. Months 5-10. 27 MS5. The Spaulding team will derive a clinical index of the severity of toe-walking based on ankle biomechan- 28 ics data collected using the camera-based motion capture system. Months 6-11. 29 MS6. Veristride will collaborate with Spaulding team to develop machine-learning algorithms to estimate toe- 30 walking severity and characterize accuracy. Months 7-12. 31 Narrative Equinus gait, or “toe-walking”, is commonly observed in children with cerebral palsy (CP), and can be treated by a variety of treatments. This SBIR proposal will develop a wearable system that continuously monitors and analyses simple gait parameters in children with CP outside the clinical laboratory and during normal daily activities, which will provide clinically useful outcomes data not currently available and critical diagnostic data for determining intervention timing.

"Multi-Site Validation Study of the HLHS Arrest Predictor Each year in the US, there are thousands of children who are born with a severe congenital deformation, where one of the two ventricles in the heart is severely underdeveloped. If they survive infancy, these children can go on to live full and normal lives. The mortality rate for this condition is 15%, and 63% of these deaths are due to cardio-respiratory arrests. This alarming rate of arrest events persists despite vigilant ICU care with the best available intensive monitoring equipment. Our overall goal is to improve current patient monitoring systems by developing machine learning algorithms that can predict the onset of an arrest event, hours before it occurs. This early warning indication can be provided to nurses and doctors who can intervene to prevent these life-threatening events from occurring, improving outcomes for these critically ill children. Preliminary studies at Texas Children's Hospital have resulted in a computer algorithm that can estimate the odds of arrest in single ventricle children, 1-2 hours prior to overt symptoms. The algorithm is based on a logistic regression risk model, and was developed using over 55,000 hours of vital sign observations. The specific aims of the proposed research are: (1) To test the hypothesis that this computer algorithm can provide an early warning of arrest, with sufficient accuracy for clinical use across different clinical centers; (2) To understand the relationship between the risk score provided by this algorithm and other post- surgical complications that commonly occur in these children during the their hospitalization. Aim 1 is a multi-center study of this algorithm on a large, prospective, and independent cohort, in order to measure its true predictive performance. Performance metrics to be measured will be the ROC area and positive and negative likelihood ratios. This will help us determine the optimal threshold for the detection of an arrest event. Aims 2 focus on relating the risk of arrest to outcomes such as mechanical circulatory support, re-operation, arrhythmia, and necrotizing enterocolitis. Successful completion of these aims will result in the first clinically validated, real- time early warning system for anticipating acute arrest events in children with single ventricle physiology. The techniques and technologies developed in this work are immediately translatable to other diseases and conditions for both adults and children. Thousands of children each year are born in the US with only a single functional ventricle, putting them at substantial risk of acute cardiac arrest and ultimately death. This project will validate a new monitoring technology, developed at Texas Children's Hospital, which can predict the onset of arrest 1-2 hours before it occurs in this population. This technology will provide nurses and doctors the valuable time that they need to mitigate problems leading up to arrest before these problems become life threatening, improving the chance of survival for these critically ill children.",Multi-Site Validation Study of the HLHS Arrest Predictor,9577420,R01HL142994,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Behavior', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Colorado', 'Common Ventricle', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computers', 'Critically ill children', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Equipment', 'Event', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Heart Arrest', 'Heart Ventricle', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Infant', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Necrotizing Enterocolitis', 'Nurses', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Palliative Surgery', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Monitoring System', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatric cardiology', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Postoperative Period', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Surgical complication', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'base', 'care providers', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'infancy', 'mortality', 'news', 'operation', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'repaired', 'respiratory', 'validation studies']",NHLBI,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2018,644011,0.1279776550593257
"Development of a novel mobile health tool for age-specific dehydration assessment and management in patients with diarrheal disease Project Summary Diarrheal diseases lead to an estimated 2.4 billion episodes of illness and 1.3 million deaths each year, with the majority of those deaths occurring in adults, adolescents, and children over five years. As the severity of diarrheal diseases can vary widely, accurately assessing dehydration status remains the most crucial step in preventing morbidity and mortality. While patients with severe dehydration require hospital admission and immediate resuscitation with intravenous fluids to prevent hemodynamic compromise, organ ischemia, and death, those with mild to moderate dehydration can be treated in outpatient settings with relatively inexpensive oral rehydration solution. Yet, while several tools have been validated for use in children under five years of age, no clinical diagnostic tool has ever been validated for the assessment of dehydration severity in adults, adolescents or children over five years of age with acute diarrhea. Differences in both adult physiology and diarrhea etiology may compromise the accuracy of clinical diagnostic models developed for use in young children. The proposed research will derive the very first age-specific clinical diagnostic models created for the assessment of dehydration status in patients over five years of age with acute diarrhea, incorporate those models into a new mobile health (mHealth) tool, and validate the performance of this tool in a new population of patients with acute diarrhea. To accomplish this task, we will enroll a prospective cohort of adults and children over five years of age with acute diarrhea presenting to the rehydration unit of the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b) in Dhaka, Bangladesh and collect data on presenting clinical signs and symptoms shown to correlate with dehydration severity in prior studies. We will then employ machine learning techniques to derive age-specific clinical diagnostic models for assessing dehydration in patients over five years of age with acute diarrhea. We will conduct formative research among clinicians working at icddr,b to develop an innovative mobile phone based platform which will incorporate these new age-specific diagnostic models for rapid use by frontline health workers. Finally, we will validate both the accuracy and reliability of the newly developed mHealth tool in a new population of adults and children over five years of age with acute diarrhea. Once developed and properly validated, this novel mHealth tool has the potential to help physicians, nurses, and other healthcare providers more accurately diagnose dehydration severity and better determine the optimal management strategy for patients with acute diarrhea. Improved diagnostic approaches may in turn be shown to reduce both the morbidity and mortality that occurs as a result of missed diagnoses of dehydration, as well as the adverse events and inappropriate utilization of limited healthcare resources that can result from inaccurate diagnoses of dehydration. Project Narrative Dehydration due to diarrheal diseases remains a leading cause of death in both children and adults worldwide, yet no clinical tools have ever been validated for the assessment of dehydration severity in adults or children over five years of age with acute diarrhea. The proposed research will both develop and validate an innovative new mobile phone based platform for the assessment of dehydration severity in adults, adolescents, and older children with acute diarrhea. This new mobile health tool will help physicians, nurses, and other providers worldwide to determine the best management strategies for patients with acute diarrhea, potentially improving and rationalizing care for the hundreds of millions of patients each year presenting to healthcare facilities around the world with acute diarrhea.",Development of a novel mobile health tool for age-specific dehydration assessment and management in patients with diarrheal disease,9593233,R01DK116163,"['5 year old', 'Acute Diarrhea', 'Admission activity', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Bangladesh', 'Beds', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Car Phone', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cost Savings', 'Data', 'Dehydration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diarrhea', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Future', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'IV Fluid', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'International Unit', 'Ischemia', 'Lead', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nurses', 'Oral', 'Organ', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Prospective cohort', 'Provider', 'Rehydration Solutions', 'Rehydrations', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Severities', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'accurate diagnosis', 'age group', 'base', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical predictors', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'international center', 'low and middle-income countries', 'mHealth', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'prevent', 'success', 'tool', 'usability']",NIDDK,RHODE ISLAND HOSPITAL,R01,2018,544336,0.03703644271110692
"The New Tics Study: A Novel Approach to Pathophysiology and Cause of Tic Disorders Project Abstract At least 20% of all children have tics at some time in their life, making tic disorders a subject of substantial public health interest. However, only about 3% of all children have tics that last for a year or more. Thus chronic tic disorders, including Tourette syndrome, can be conceptualized as a two- step process: tics start, and then they fail to remit. By the numbers, the second part of this process is the more unusual and perhaps more closely related to disease, yet surprisingly, almost no research has examined this critical period after a first tic appears but before it is clear whether the child will go on to have a chronic tic disorder. Therefore prior research that has identified abnormalities of brain structure and function in children with TS generally does not clarify whether these abnormalities are related to tic appearance or to the more important process of tic disappearance. Furthermore, tic disappearance can be observed prospectively, allowing powerful within-subject analyses to test whether features of brain structure or function shortly after tic onset predict remission of tics before TS is diagnosable, and whether such features are state-related or more durable markers of vulnerability to tics. Colleagues in the TS field have agreed that such studies would be valuable, but have suspected that recruitment would be extremely difficult. However, we have now demonstrated enrollment of subjects with New Tics (defined as beginning within the previous 6 months, median 3.6 months) at a rate of 16 subjects per year when recruitment efforts were at their peak—though still on a shoestring budget without full staffing or media advertisements. We have implemented subject preparation and quality control methods that have allowed us to acquire structural and functional MRI data of high quality in many subjects. We now propose to enroll an additional 70 subjects with New Tics and characterize them carefully at baseline and at the 1-year anniversary of tic onset (when TS can first be diagnosed). Both time points will include clinical data, structural and functional MRI, and neuropsychological measures including ability to suppress tics. We expect that complete data will be available for 55-70 subjects (including those already collected), since MRI is sensitive to movement and we are selecting for subjects with tics and additional difficulty holding still (about half of children with tics also have ADHD). We will compare baseline data from this sample to matched tic-free control subjects, and to matched subjects who already have TS or a chronic tic disorder (leveraging existing data in our laboratories to provide some of the clinical and MRI data for these groups). Analyses will include tests of specific a priori hypotheses as well as machine learning analyses of the complete dataset. These comparisons will allow us to discover whether imaging differences in children with TS are present long before TS can be diagnosed, whether they fade when tics improve, and whether they predict outcome in children with new tics. Investigation of this “pre-Tourette” population opens an entirely new window for etiologic discovery in tic disorders. It may also have important clinical consequences, if the results identify which newly- ticcing children are at highest risk for development of a chronic tic disorder. Public Health Relevance Statement At least 20% of all children have tics at some time in their life, making tic disorders a subject of substantial public health interest. In many children the tics will disappear before they've lasted as long as a year, but in others they go on to become Tourette syndrome or Chronic Tic Disorder (TS/CTD). Prior research generally has not clarified whether abnormalities of brain structure and function in children with TS/CTD are related to tic appearance or to the more important process of tic disappearance. This project will study children with recent-onset tics using clinical evaluation, MRI, and neuropsychological measures, and repeat these measures at the earliest time point that TS/CTD can be diagnosed. The results from the first assessment will be compared to results from two matching comparison groups: children with no personal or family history of tics, and children who have had tics for more than a year (Existing TS/CTD). This new approach may provide a new angle on research into Tourette syndrome, in addition to providing sorely needed information about prognosis for children who just started ticcing.",The New Tics Study: A Novel Approach to Pathophysiology and Cause of Tic Disorders,9503067,R01MH104030,"['Advertisements', 'Age', 'Anniversary', 'Appearance', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Budgets', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Family history of', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Image', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Neuropsychology', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Quality Control', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Rest', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Tic disorder', 'Time', 'brain abnormalities', 'caudate nucleus', 'comparison group', 'critical period', 'dexterity', 'follow-up', 'habit learning', 'high risk', 'improved', 'inattention', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'medical attention', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'phenomenological models', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'secondary analysis', 'vector']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,636092,0.09991584157417101
"Predicting Heterogeneous Neurodevelopmental Outcomes in School-age Children with Early Caregiving Adversities Project Summary Children with severe Early Caregiving Adversities (ECAs) are the most vulnerable to psychopathology as a result of prolonged neglect, abuse, and care disruptions that impact neurodevelopment. It is currently estimated that addressing ECAs would lead to a 29.8% reduction in worldwide psychiatric illness. Existing research, including findings from the original grant of this renewal, has demonstrated that there is a very strong link between ECA exposures and increased risk for psychopathology and altered neurodevelopment at the population level; and yet, given the heterogeneity in ECA populations, there is a critical gap in knowledge regarding how ECAs increase any specific risks to an individual child. The proposed research addresses this significant mental health problem by combining sophisitcated data-analysis methods that use experiential and phenotypic heterogeneity together with longitudinal neuroimaging and behavioral assessments in school-age children. This approach will increase precision when linking ECAs and child outcomes associated with the Research Domain Criteria constructs of Negative Valence and Cognitive Control Systems (NVS/CCS). The overarching goal of the present work is to create an explanatory model for the heterogeneous impact of ECAs on neurodevelopmental trajectories of NVS/CCS. This project's premise is that children exposed to ECAs have highly heterogeneous developmental histories as well as heterogeneous outcomes; therefore, prediction of ECA outcomes requires cutting-edge, sophisticated data analytic methods. We hypothesize that data-driven approaches will 1) more precisely define NVS/CCS outcomes for school-aged children with ECAs, and 2) provide a more robust explanatory model for links between ECAs and NVS/CCS trajectories. Aim 1A subtypes children with a history of ECAs based on 2.5-year developmental trajectories of NVS/CCS. 300 6-8 year old children (250 sampled from previous institutional and foster care; 50 community comparisons) will provide neuroimaging, behavioral, and self/caregiver reports every 15 months for 2.5 years. Biclustering methods will be applied to the baseline and follow-up data to identify homogeneous NVS/CCS final outcome clusters of children. Aim 1B develops an explanatory model to predict developmental trajectory subtypes for children with ECAs, from early life profiles and brain/behavior phenotypes at the time of enrollment. Machine learning methods applied to early life profiles, baseline NVS/CCS profiles, and sex, will predict developmental trajectory subtypes. Aim 2 identifies adverse and protective life events during the 2.5-year assessment period that are predictive of 2.5-year follow-up outcomes for children with ECAs. The inclusion of child-sex and current life- events will identify potential divergence in pathways across middle childhood. This prospective design of children exposed to various ECAs is designed to develop predictive models for ECA trajectory subtypes and outcomes, which can inform our understanding of risk and protective factors in accord with the goals of precision medicine.   Project Narrative Children with severe Early Caregiving Adversities (ECAs) are the most vulnerable to psychopathology, and it is estimated that addressing ECAs would lead to a 29.8% reduction in worldwide psychiatric illness. Existing research has demonstrated that there is a very strong link between ECA exposures and increased risk for psychopathology and altered neurodevelopment at the population level; and yet, given the heterogeneity in ECA populations, there is a critical gap in knowledge regarding how ECAs increase any specific risks to an individual child.

"PREDICTING CHILDHOOD OUTCOMES IN PRETERM INFANTS USING CEREBRAL CONNECTIVITY DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Premature birth remains a major public health issue due to its continuing high incidence combined with the frequency of developmental impairments among surviving infants. In order to improve developmental outcomes in very preterm infants (VPT, born prior to 32 weeks' gestation), accurate and early identification of the alterations in brain development that lead to subsequent developmental impairment is required. The candidate for this K02 Independent Scientist Award is a uniquely trained pediatric neurologist who seeks to define the relationship between cerebral connectivity during infancy and childhood developmental outcomes. This project will involve a valuable, well-characterized VPT cohort (N=128) which includes high-risk children selected due to the presence of brain injury during the neonatal period. These children have undergone clinical characterization and MRI during the neonatal period and developmental assessment at age 2 years. They will now undergo standardized assessment of developmental outcomes at age 5 years. The central hypotheses are that VPT children will display a persisting range of motor and language difficulties, and that affected VPT children will display abnormalities on imaging measures obtained during infancy that predict childhood performance, both at the group and individual level, in these distinct and critical developmental domains. We propose to investigate these postulates by: 1) comprehensively evaluating childhood motor and language performance; 2) defining the relationship between alterations in domain-specific neonatal functional and structural connectivity and childhood motor and language outcomes; and 3) investigating differences in brain- wide cerebral connectivity in impaired VPT children using machine learning, pattern classification approach. The result will be characterization of the alterations in cerebral connectivity that underlie developmental disabilities in VPT children. In addition, we seek to develop highly valuable neuroimaging biomarkers that predict future motor and language impairment, enabling the provision of targeted care tailored to the needs of each individual infant. Finally, these tools will contribute to future, large-scale trials evaluating interventions designed to protect the developing brain. In pursuit of this goal, a focused career development program will complement the candidate's background in engineering and magnetic resonance methodology with training in developmental assessments and innovative image analysis approaches using applied mathematics, providing skills necessary to perform accurate longitudinal clinical research studies and develop individual prediction models. The supported activities will facilitate an NIH R-mechanism application centered upon innovative investigation of individual prediction models for developmental trajectories in VPT children during school-age, including repeat neuroimaging assessments during childhood. The culmination of these efforts will be transformative investigation that fosters improved outcomes for this high-risk population. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Despite continued high rates of disabilities in infants born prematurely, methods for accurately identifying those that would benefit most from specific therapies or protective interventions remain limited. This study is designed to improve our understanding of the alterations in brain function and structure that produce these deficits by using novel approaches to examine how magnetic resonance imaging data predicts early childhood outcomes. The goal is to identify imaging measures which identify preterm infants at risk for particular deficits, thereby allowing institution of timely therapies specific to each chid's needs and enabling larger research trials evaluating interventions designed to improve developmental outcomes in this vulnerable group.",PREDICTING CHILDHOOD OUTCOMES IN PRETERM INFANTS USING CEREBRAL CONNECTIVITY,9548924,K02NS089852,"['2 year old', '5 year old', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Caring', 'Cerebrum', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Disabilities', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Early identification', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Independent Scientist Award', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Institution', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Language Disorders', 'Lead', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Motor', 'Nature', 'Neonatal', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurologist', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Program Development', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'School-Age Population', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Survival Rate', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'career development', 'cohort', 'design', 'disability', 'early childhood', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'language impairment', 'motor deficit', 'motor impairment', 'neonatal brain', 'neonatal period', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'skills', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'white matter injury']",NINDS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K02,2018,137131,0.031835498577100094
"THE PRETERM BEHAVIORAL PHENOTYPE: TRAJECTORIES OF PSYCHOPATHOLOGY & CHANGES IN CEREBRAL CONNECTIVITY PROJECT SUMMARY: Children born prematurely are at elevated risk for psychiatric disorders, including ADHD, autism and anxiety. Indeed, the ‘preterm behavioral phenotype’ is comprised of inattention, anxiety and social- communication impairments. This constellation of comorbid disorders persists across the lifespan, accounting for long-term impairment and diminished quality of life among very preterm (VPT; born ≤32 weeks gestation) children, a population at high risk for altered brain development. Yet, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the increased prevalence of these symptoms remain undetermined. Further, VPT children face high exposure rates to deleterious psychosocial risk factors which have similarly been linked to adverse psychiatric outcomes and changes in brain development. We posit that decreased connectivity and the resulting diminished developmental trajectories within and across key functional networks (e.g., default mode, frontoparietal control and cingulo-opercular networks) and related white matter tracts (e.g., cingulum, corpus callosum and uncinate) underlie comorbid preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms that persist or worsen at age 9-10. This process begins during infancy and extends to middle childhood, with psychosocial risk playing an important modifying role. Advances in MRI methodology now enable characterization of structural and functional brain networks with unparalleled spatial and temporal resolution. Here, we couple these highly innovative, state-of-the-art MRI techniques with detailed psychiatric assessments to study our unique, sociodemographically-diverse longitudinal cohort of VPT and term-born children (N=302) with high rates of psychosocial adversity now reaching age 9-10. The cohort has been followed since birth, including prospective collection of high-quality neonatal functional and structural connectivity MRI data and longitudinal assessments of preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms and psychosocial and familial factors at ages 2 and 5, with >80% cohort retention to date at both assessment waves. Continued evaluation of this enriched cohort provides an opportunity to determine: 1) trajectories of preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms to define early indicators of later impairment enabling targeted interventions, 2) relationships between neonatal and age 9-10 functional and structural connectivity and these deficits, and 3) the modifying role of psychosocial adversity. Application of cutting-edge MRI acquisition and analysis methods, including machine learning approaches, enables unprecedented characterization of the effects of VPT birth on connectivity in the developing brain. We will extend these methods to delineate relationships between imaging measures and preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms, improving understanding of modifiable effects of early life exposures and psychosocial risk on psychiatric outcomes. These data are critical for developing individual- level neuroimaging, behavioral and psychosocial presymptomatic predictive models for adverse mental health outcomes, measures necessary to inform and evaluate treatments applicable during sensitive developmental periods which mitigate risks of psychopathology associated with prematurity and psychosocial adversity. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH This study is designed to improve our understanding of the changes in brain structure and function that underlie the elevated rates of inattention, anxiety and autism spectrum symptoms now increasingly recognized in prematurely-born children. Using cutting-edge magnetic resonance imaging methods, we will investigate these relationships in a unique, longitudinally-studied cohort of very preterm and term-born children with high rates of psychosocial adversity now reaching age 9-10 years and previously studied using neuroimaging during infancy and detailed assessments of psychiatric symptoms during early childhood. The overarching goal is development of new approaches for earlier, more accurate identification of children at risk for these disorders, enabling progress toward targeted interventions which improve outcomes by limiting risks for psychopathology associated with prematurity and psychosocial adversity.",THE PRETERM BEHAVIORAL PHENOTYPE: TRAJECTORIES OF PSYCHOPATHOLOGY & CHANGES IN CEREBRAL CONNECTIVITY,9568804,R01MH113570,"['Accounting', 'Age', 'Anisotropy', 'Anxiety', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Cerebrum', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Effect', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neonatal', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pattern', 'Perinatal', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Infant', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Survival Rate', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'associated symptom', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'early childhood', 'early life exposure', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'inattention', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'middle childhood', 'neonatal magnetic resonance imaging', 'neonate', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'premature', 'prospective', 'psychiatric disability', 'psychiatric symptom', 'psychosocial', 'sex', 'social', 'social communication', 'social communication impairment', 'targeted treatment', 'temporal measurement', 'white matter']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,622284,0.02504731526375336
"Verb learning and the early development of sentence comprehension DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Children use syntax to understand sentences and to learn verbs; this is syntactic bootstrapping. We proposed a Structure Mapping account of the origins of syntactic bootstrapping. On this account, children begin with an unlearned bias toward one-to-one mapping between nouns in sentences and participant-roles in events. Given this bias, children find the number of nouns in a sentence inherently meaningful. In the previous funding period, we tested key predictions of this account, and found strong evidence for structure-mapping. Identifying the set of nouns in sentences yields a partial representation of syntactic structure that allows toddlers to identify verbs, and to interpret novel transitive and intransitive verbs in simple sentences. The proposed research asks how syntactic bootstrapping moves beyond 'counting the nouns', scaling up to the true complexity of verbs and sentences. We focus on two data-sources: distributional learning and discourse structure. First, we propose that distributional learning creates probabilistic syntactic-semantic combinatorial knowledge about verbs. This combinatorial knowledge, also known as verb bias, permits syntactic bootstrapping, and from early in development is used online to help identify the structure and lexical content of sentences, guiding syntactic analysis. Second, we propose that a bias toward discourse continuity increases linguistic support for verb learning by allowing learners to collect evidence for arguments across nearby sentences. Verb bias guides this process, by cuing children to seek referents for missing arguments in the discourse context. To investigate these proposals we combine experiments with toddlers and preschoolers, and a computational model based on systems for automatic semantic role labeling. Experiments with children assess comprehension of familiar and invented verbs in sentences, by measuring children's visual fixations to relevant scenes or objects. Project 1 explores toddlers' encoding of syntactic-semantic combinatorial facts about verbs from listening experience. Project 2 explores toddlers' use of discourse context to guide sentence interpretation, constrained by verb bias. Project 3 asks to what extent verb bias in preschoolers changes with new distributional learning. In Project 4 we develop our computational model to investigate the same processes. Results from experiments with children constrain the features we equip the model to detect; we use the model to test the consequences of our claims for learning from corpora of natural child-directed speech. This combination of experimental and computational studies will advance scientific knowledge about how children learn their native languages, and guide the development of new, robust learning protocols that will be of use in automatic natural language processing. The proposed research will help us to understand how children learn the words and syntax of their native languages; such research will contribute to the detection and remediation of language delays, and to language pedagogy. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research will examine verb learning and the development of sentence comprehension, using a combination of experiments with toddlers and preschoolers, and a computational model of early sentence comprehension. Our findings should have considerable impact, for two main reasons: First, our work will shed light on how learners begin to find meaning in syntax, addressing long-standing and fundamental scientific questions about language development. Second, the findings should help us predict and understand the consequences of individual variations in the early language environment for language development: by studying how young children collect and use linguistic-distributional data about words, we can predict what kinds of data they need to make typical progress, and thus what kinds of early experiences might lead to risks for language difficulties.",Verb learning and the early development of sentence comprehension,9461567,R01HD054448,"['Address', 'Behavior', 'Child', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Language', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ocular Fixation', 'Participant', 'Play', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Semantics', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Toddler', 'Uncertainty', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'combinatorial', 'computer studies', 'early experience', 'expectation', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'lexical', 'novel', 'pedagogy', 'public health relevance', 'remediation', 'scale up', 'syntax', 'theories', 'word learning']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R01,2018,307933,-0.012583958327156744
"A Computational Biomechanical Airway Model for Obese Children at Risk for OSAS This application is being submitted to PA-18-591 in accordance with NOT-OD-18-194. The proposed supplement INCLUDE project is entitled: “Upper Airway Structure and Function and Risk for OSA in Children with Down Syndrome”. The project is within the scope of R01 HL130468 entitled: “A Computational Biomechanical Airway Model for Obese Children at Risk for OSAS” that focuses on implementing state-of-the-art magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) during wake and sleep conditions (Aim 1A) using analytical and machine learning techniques to determine the static (3D) and dynamic (4D) architecture and tissue characteristics of the upper airway in wake and sleep conditions (Aim 1B). These methods are coupled with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) (Aim 2A) and biomechanical modeling (Aim 2B) to establish the biomechanical basis of OSAS in children with obesity. The parent grant also evaluates the impact of treatment such as adenotonsillectomy or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) on airway mechanics (Aim 3A) and the clinical utility of image-based airway mechanical parameters in OSAS (Aim 3B). The tools and methodologies used in the parent project will be integrated in all Aims of this INCLUDE project. The proposed project addresses 2 important IC-specific priorities of NHLBI: 1) “Incorporation of individuals with Down syndrome into existing disease cohorts and clinical trials directed toward sleep apnea. This could include collection of tissue or blood specimens and -omics data generation and analysis, imaging, and computational modeling”, 2) Identification of potential risk and resilience factors that make individuals with Down syndrome susceptible to transient or persistent blood disorders and congenital heart disease”. The problem: Down syndrome (DS) (trisomy 21) is the most common genetic cause of developmental disability and mental retardation with an incidence of 1/800 live births (1). The prevalence of OSA in these children is very high and estimated between 50-95% (2-5), and much higher than the 1-4% prevalence in the general pediatric population (6). OSA has detrimental consequences in children, including cardiovascular, metabolic, and cognitive effects (6). This is particularly true for children with Down syndrome who are already predisposed to congenital heart anomalies and developmental delay. Therefore, the American Academy of pediatrics (AAP) emphasizes the need to screen for OSA within the first 6 months of life in all children with Down syndrome and continue to evaluate for the disorder on all medical encounters thereafter throughout childhood (7). Anatomical factors related to the Down syndrome phenotype have been attributed to the causation of OSA in this group. These include midfacial and mandibular hypoplasia (8-11), enlarged tongue (12, 13), adenoid and tonsilar hypertrophy (13, 14), laryngo-tracheal anomalies (15), and obesity (16-19). In addition, reduced neuromuscular tone has been suspected of having a role in the development of OSA in these subjects (3). Traditional methods to evaluate the upper airway in children with DS include plain lateral neck radiograph, cephalometric measurements, airway fluoroscopy, and nasal pharyngoscopy (8, 15, 20, 21). However, these methods provide only limited information regarding the entire upper airway structure. During the years our group has developed,applied, and published seminal work on the upper airway structure and function of children using MRI methodology (22-35). This body of work on normal children and children with craniofacial abnormalities including DS created a large MRI database that is the basis for the current proposal. NARRATIVE Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is a common and difficult to treat disorder in obese children and leads to significant medical consequences. We still do not understand why some obese children suffer from this disorder while other do not. The current study will use advance imaging analytical tools combined with biomechanical models to better understand the causes of the disorder and ways to improve outcomes of treatment in these children.",A Computational Biomechanical Airway Model for Obese Children at Risk for OSAS,9772627,R01HL130468,"['17 year old', 'Academy', 'Address', 'Airway Resistance', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Biomechanics', 'Blood specimen', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body mass index', 'Breathing', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Simulation', 'Continuous Positive Airway Pressure', 'Coupled', 'Craniofacial Abnormalities', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Developmental Disabilities', 'Diagnosis', 'Dilator', 'Disease', 'Down Syndrome', 'Drops', 'Epidemic', 'Etiology', 'Fluoroscopy', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hematological Disease', 'High Prevalence', 'Hypertrophy', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intercept', 'Intervention', 'Lateral', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Live Birth', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mandible', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Mental Retardation', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Muscle', 'Nasopharynx', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Neck', 'Neurocognitive', 'Nose', 'Obesity', 'Object Attachment', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Oropharyngeal', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pediatrics', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'ROC Curve', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Seminal', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Tissue Banks', 'Tissues', 'Tongue', 'Tonsil', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'awake', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'cardiometabolism', 'cohort', 'congenital heart disorder', 'design', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved outcome', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'longitudinal design', 'neuromuscular', 'novel', 'obesity in children', 'parent grant', 'parent project', 'pharyngeal critical pressure', 'pressure', 'resilience', 'respiratory', 'response', 'shear stress', 'standard care', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,"ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, INC",R01,2018,420407,0.06653076172342054
"Novel Accelerometer Calibration and Validation in Children andAdolescents Summary Accelerometers have been embraced by the scientific community as valid and reliable physical activity (PA) assessment tools. This is especially true in some sub-populations, such as children, who lack the ability to self- report their behaviors. Tremendous progress has been made in the objective assessment of PA and sedentary behavior (SB). Several measurement challenges remain that limit our ability to identify; dose-response associations with disease and risk factors, prevalence and determinants of these important health behaviors, changes in behavior due to time and intervention efforts. To overcome these challenges, we propose novel calibration procedures that will leverage the richness of three axes of raw acceleration data during free-living calibration activities, from wrist- and hip-worn accelerometers. Consistent with current PA recommendations for youth, the proposed study will focus on calibrating and validating accelerometer output to quantify intensity and duration of PA and identifying specific predominant modes of activity (e.g., sedentary time, locomotion, and fine/gross motor activity). Our primary goal is to follow best-practices data collection and analysis procedures to develop a comprehensive set of accelerometer algorithms that will accurately and precisely estimate minutes of various intensities of PA and mode of activity from hip- and wrist-worn accelerometers in children and adolescents (18 months to 21 years old), using video recorded direct observation during free-living activities as the criterion measure. Narrative Accurate and precise estimates of physical activity, sedentary behavior, and patterns of those behaviors in youth are essential in order to identify changes in those behaviors and to inform related policy decisions. The proposed research will extend previous accelerometer calibration studies by videotaping free-living activities in a large sample across a wide age range of children and adolescents. The raw acceleration signals from both hip- and wrist-worn devices will be analyzed using linear regression and machine learning methods to generate a family of freely available algorithms that produce accurate and precise estimates, reducing inconsistencies and confusion on use of previous accelerometer cutpoints in youth.",Novel Accelerometer Calibration and Validation in Children andAdolescents,9470866,R01DK110148,"['21 year old', 'Acceleration', 'Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavior', 'Calibration', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Confusion', 'Controlled Environment', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Family', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Health behavior change', 'Hip region structure', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Linear Regressions', 'Locomotion', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Output', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Physical assessment', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Videotape', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'Youth', 'age group', 'base', 'behavior change', 'computerized data processing', 'disorder risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'response', 'sedentary', 'sedentary lifestyle']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST,R01,2018,345436,0.06274023999338837
"Development and Evaluation of an Evidence-Based Mobile Health Caregiver Intervention for FASD Project Summary/Abstract

"A Computational Biomechanical Airway Model for Obese Children at Risk for OSAS ABSTRACT Childhood obesity remains epidemic and is most prevalent in minorities. Obese children have a higher risk for developing obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) with an estimated prevalence of 50%, compared to the general pediatric population with a known prevalence of 2-4%. OSAS carries with it significant neurocognitive, cardiovascular, and metabolic derangements. Additionally, obese children do not respond well to treatment such as adenotonsillectomy or weight loss with residual OSAS exceeding 50%. Despite progress that has been made in recent years to understand the anatomical and functional attributes of OSAS in children, the precise mechanism leading to the disorder remains unknown in the majority of obese children, hindering the development of efficacious treatments. Thus, the overarching goal of this study is to implement state-of-the-art dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and image analytics using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and biomechanical modeling, to establish the biomechanical basis that leads to OSAS or protects from it, in naïve and treated children with obesity. NARRATIVE Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is a common and difficult to treat disorder in obese children and leads to significant medical consequences.

"Development and Validation of an Automated Measurement of Child Screen Media Use: FLASH The obesity field is fraught with problems of measuring people's diet, physical activity and sedentary behaviors that are hindering the advancement of the field to find promising solutions for obesity prevention and treatment. An important example is screen media use, a prominent cause for sedentary time that has been linked to obesity and metabolic syndrome, as well as other unwanted physiologic, psychosocial, and academic outcomes in children. Given the important impact screen use has on children's health, our ability to measure the time children spend on screens is very limited. Current assessments typically rely either on (1) general questions estimating “typical use;” or self- or parent-report via screen use diaries, both which have reporting bias and recall bias; or (2) devises initially intended to restrict children's TV viewing (TV Allowance™), which may have intervention effects or miss-classify TV viewing time. While automatic and objective measures of physical activity have shown validity and reliability for quantifying children's physical activity, no system that is automatic, accurate and unobtrusive has been developed to assess children's screen use on different platforms. Advances in technology, such as person detection, accurate facial recognition based on images, and imaging, computer vision and signal processing algorithms now offer novel and promising solutions to objectively and automatically measure people's screen viewing behaviors. We will leverage these recent advances and integrate them to develop a first of its kind, in-home, unobtrusive, automatic, privacy preserving screen use monitoring system: Family Level Assessment of Screen use in the Home (FLASH) that uses an embedded computing platform connected to a video camera on larger, stationary screens (FLASH-TV); or functions as a background app using a front facing camera (FLASH-Mobile). Our trans-disciplinary group, consisting of behavioral researchers at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) and electrical engineers at Rice University, propose to develop and asses the validity of the FLASH to accurately identify whether and for how long a child is using screen media devices. In this multiple-PI application, the development of FLASH is led by engineers at Rice. Once a final system has been developed, alpha and beta tested, a validation study will take place in observation labs by the BCM behavioral researchers with 6-10 year old children for FLASH-TV and FLASH-Mobile (n=43). Comparisons of FLASH output will be made to staff observations of children participating in a set of structured predefined activities. Next FLASH will be assessed for feasibility and accuracy for identifying children's screen use across platforms in a naturalistic home setting (n=46), compared to direct observation and screen use diaries. This project has the potential of creating a paradigm shift in scientist's ability to assess the role screen use has on health outcomes or intervention effects of screen media reduction programs, similar to that of accelerometers for physical activity research. FLASH has the potential of having a significant impact on public health and clinical research regarding screen media use.   PROJECT NARRATIVE Higher levels of screen media use have been associated with obesity, metabolic syndrome and other unwanted health and psychosocial outcomes in children. Despite the recent attention screen use has received among public health and clinical circles, the measurement of screen use behaviors is very crude and inaccurate. In this application, we propose to develop and assess the validity of an in-home objective, unobtrusive, automatic, privacy preserving screen use monitoring system, called FLASH that has the potential to revolutionize the measurement of screen use behaviors.",Development and Validation of an Automated Measurement of Child Screen Media Use: FLASH,9461051,R01DK113269,"['10 year old', 'Accelerometer', 'Algorithms', 'Asses', 'Attention', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Child Health', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Data Reporting', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diet', 'Documentation', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Engineering', 'Face', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Privacy', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Rice', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Structure', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Video Recording', 'Weight', 'Youth', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'behavioral outcome', 'college', 'cost', 'diaries', 'field study', 'gaze', 'handheld mobile device', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'intervention effect', 'monitoring device', 'novel', 'obesity development', 'obesity prevention', 'obesity treatment', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'sedentary', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'signal processing', 'tv watching', 'validation studies']",NIDDK,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2018,435074,0.06252639336634973
"Biomechanics and Walking in Cerebral Palsy: Ankle Foot Orthoses - Footwear Combinations Project Summary/Abstract: Ambulatory children with cerebral palsy (CP) demonstrate significant gait deviations (e.g., excessive hip/knee flexion in stance), which limits their walking activity and ability to physically participate in day to day life. Ankle Foot Orthoses (AFO) is a fundamental rehabilitation strategy to facilitate walking in children with CP; yet, efficacy in this population remains equivocal. The immediate positive effect of Ankle Foot Orthoses-Footwear Combinations (AFO-FC), a novel systematic decision tree for orthotic prescription for gait deviations in CP has been documented in the lab. Case series data has documented significant positive effects on gait speed, community walking activity and parent satisfaction for the AFO-FC. The underlying biomechanical mechanisms and clinical predictors of effect are unclear. The objective of this pilot study application is to examine the effect of AFO-FC on overall gait deviations and walking speed as compared to current AFO in children with CP. To identify potential biomechanical mechanisms, we will capture gait deviations during stance. We will examine the effect of the AFO-FC on balance, daily walking activity, physical activity and satisfaction. The premise of the AFO-FC approach, which incorporates a rigid AFO, is that individualized segment alignment and shoe modifications controls ankle movement and appears visually to enhance hip/knee extension during mid stance and commencement of terminal stance. We hypothesize that AFO-FC approach will decrease gait deviations in stance towards the alignment of typically developing children, which will positively affect gait speed, balance, community-based walking and physical activity. This hypothesis will be tested by the following specific aims. Aim 1: examine the effect of AFO-FC on overall gait deviations and walking speed as compared to current AFO in children with CP. We propose a randomized waitlist study of 22 ambulatory children with CP and bilateral barefoot midstance crouch gait, ages 4 to 9 years to compare currently prescribed AFO to the AFO- FC. Gait deviations and walking speed will be measured by instrumented three dimensional gait analyses. Aim 2: examine the effect of AFO-FC on daily walking activity, balance and satisfaction as compared to current AFO in children with CP Walking activity will be captured by the StepWatch accelerometer; balance with the Pediatric Balance Scale and physical activity and satisfaction through parental report questionnaires. This project is innovative because it focuses on a novel approach to individualized orthotic prescription employing a published decision tree in a heterogeneous population with a study design that leverages recruitment and retention. The proposed research is significant because it will be the first step in a continuum of research that is expected to direct orthotic prescription and rehab strategies across pediatric disabilities and positively effect changes in community-based walking activity for children with CP. Advances in the understanding of the biomechanical mechanisms by which children with CP respond to AFO-FC are expected with relevance to the health and functional benefits of enhanced mobility and physical activity across the life span. Project Narrative: The proposed project is relevant to public health because the discovery of effective clinical orthotic management strategies and underlying biomechanical mechanisms is expected to positively effect changes in community-based walking activity, balance, physical activity and function for children with CP. This knowledge will inform current and future orthotic rehabilitation interventions for persons with neuromotor limitations. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the NICHD’s mission pertaining to development of knowledge that ensures the health, productivity, independence and well-being of people through optimal rehabilitation.",Biomechanics and Walking in Cerebral Palsy: Ankle Foot Orthoses - Footwear Combinations,9502787,R21HD094823,"['Accelerometer', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Ankle', 'Bilateral', 'Biomechanics', 'Case Series', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Equinus Deformity', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Gait speed', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heel', 'Hip region structure', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Joints', 'Kinetics', 'Knee', 'Knowledge', 'Leg', 'Length', 'Life', 'Limb structure', 'Longevity', 'Lower Extremity', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modification', 'Movement', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Orthotic Devices', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Productivity', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized', 'Reaction', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Shoes', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Waiting Lists', 'Walking', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'crouch gait', 'disability', 'experience', 'foot', 'functional outcomes', 'gait examination', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'kinematics', 'mobility enhancement', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'orthotics', 'prosthesis wearer', 'recruit', 'rehabilitation strategy', 'satisfaction', 'therapy design', 'trial comparing', 'vector', 'walking speed']",NICHD,SEATTLE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2018,227166,0.0879835970264937
"Predicting the early childhood outcomes of preterm brain shape abnormalities PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The last months of pregnancy are particularly important for the development of the child's brain, and the consequences of premature birth on its development can be substantial. Prematurely born children are at higher risk of various cognitive impairments and exhibits more behavioral disorders than full-term born children. Thus early detection and management of at risk children are essential. There is growing evidence of significant volumetric abnormalities in subcortical structures of premature neonates, which may be associated to negative long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. Understanding these abnormalities could help elucidate the underlying pathophysiology and enable early determination of at-risk patients, both of which would inform the design of novel treatment strategies. However, to date there is still a lack of sensitive, reliable, and accessible algorithms capable of characterizing the influence of prematurity on the anatomy of neonatal brain subcortical structures. In addition, few studies have looked directly at the long-term neurodevelopmental implications of these neonatal subcortical structures abnormalities. Predicting long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes early on – and preferably at neonatal ages – is likely to have a transformative effect on their outcome. Our preliminary data indicate significant morphological differences in the putamen, ventricles, corpus callosum, and thalamus between preterm and term neonates. We propose to develop biomarkers of prematurity by statistically comparing the morphological and diffusion properties of subcortical structures between preterm and term neonates using brain MRI. These results will further be used in a sparse learning framework to predict long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes of prematurity. Hypotheses: By combining subcortical morphological and diffusion properties, we will be able to: (1) delineate specific correlative relationships between structures regionally and differentially affected by normal maturation and different patterns of white matter injury, and (2) improve the specificity of neuroimaging to predict neurodevelopmental outcomes earlier. Aim 1: Build a new toolbox for neonatal subcortical structures analyses that combine 1) a group lasso-based analysis of significant regions of shape changes, 2) a structural correlation network analysis, 3) a neonatal tractography, and 4) tensor-based analysis on tracts. Aim 2: Ascertain biomarkers of prematurity in neonates with different patterns of abnormalities. Aim 3: Assess the predictive potential of imaging and clinical features on neurodevelopmental outcomes among premature children at 12 and 18 months and 6-8 years of age. Impact: This application will provide the first complete subcortical network analysis in both term and preterm neonates. In the first study of its kind for prematurity, we will use sparse and multi-task learning to determine which of the biomarkers of prematurity at birth are the best predictors of long-term outcome. The expected findings could improve our ability to predict these outcomes and enable the design of early treatments – before years of pathological brain development and symptoms occur. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH We propose to develop biomarkers of prematurity by statistically comparing the morphological and diffusion properties of subcortical structures between preterm and term neonates. A better understanding of the neurological biomarkers of prematurity will help promote early clinical management of prematurely born infants who are at higher risk of many neurodevelopmental deficits, including attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and various learning impairments (i.e. dyslexia, dysorthographia, dyscalculia).",Predicting the early childhood outcomes of preterm brain shape abnormalities,9568765,R01EB025032,"['8 year old', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain scan', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Cognitive', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dyslexia', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Exhibits', 'Functional disorder', 'Hearing', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Lasso', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Neonatal', 'Network-based', 'Neurodevelopmental Deficit', 'Neurologic', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Problem behavior', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain shape', 'caudate nucleus', 'design', 'early childhood', 'high risk', 'imaging potential', 'improved', 'interest', 'lateral ventricle', 'mathematics disability', 'morphometry', 'multitask', 'neonatal brain', 'neonate', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'premature', 'premature neonates', 'preterm newborn', 'putamen', 'social communication', 'tractography', 'treatment strategy', 'vector', 'white matter', 'white matter injury']",NIBIB,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OF LOS ANGELES,R01,2018,392718,0.013576843711666734
"Microbiota, Inflammation and Environmental Enteric Dysfunction (MiEED) PROJECT SUMMARY In this application, I am requesting support from a career development award to support my research proposal titled “Microbiota, Inflammation and Environmental Enteric Dysfunction”. I will be undertaking this work with the mentorship of Dr. Jeffrey Gordon (Primary US mentor) at the Washington University, St Louis and Dr. Asad Ali (Primary LMIC mentor) at the Aga Khan University. This project builds on our existing studies of Environmental Enteric Dysfunction (EED), funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The current application aims to improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of EED by studying the evolution of gut microbial configuration in children who have clinical and histological evidence of EED. EED is common in children living in impoverished conditions with limited access to clean drinking water and sanitation. Histopathological changes of EED in small bowel mucosa include alteration in crypt to villous ratio along with lymphocytic infiltration of the villous epithelium and lamina propria. Although studies involving biopsies of small bowel mucosa are critical to study EED, these studies are uncommon because of logistic challenges involving performing endoscopies in field settings in LMICs. We have previously demonstrated in an ongoing BMGF funded study that we are able to safely obtain such biopsies, we now have a unique opportunity to study the relationship between gut microbiome evolution and EED in this cohort. The central hypothesis of the current application is that children with histological confirmation of EED have shared features of a bacterial community which is different from healthy controls and non-EED subjects, and that such changes in bacterial configuration are associated with enteric and systemic inflammation. For testing these hypotheses, evaluation of gut microbiome in healthy and stunted children will be carried out to identify the age discriminatory bacterial taxa in children with and without confirmation of EED. Dr. Gordon will be providing mentorship and experience in gut microbiome and microbiota analysis. Dr. Ali will provide the needed infrastructure of the field site and laboratory facilities, along with linking the microbiome analysis with clinical and histological outcomes of interest. The Aga Khan University is a leading regional research institute with multiple support systems for junior investigators which will be vital for my career transition as an independent scientist. My long term goal is to be the principal investigator of my own laboratory, focusing on studying the gut microbiome and its relationship with communicable and non-communicable diseases. I envision working on microbiota derived therapy for EED, and to find targets in the inflammatory pathways driven by changes in gut homeostasis. PROJECT NARRATIVE Globally, Pakistan has the third highest rate of stunting among children aged < 5 years. Environmental Enteric Dysfunction (EED) is proposed to be a critical factor responsible for chronic growth faltering in children in resource limited settings. This research utilizes an innovative approach to study a program of postnatal gut microbiome development in children and its impact on child growth. This proposal will provide an ideal training platform for a translational scientist, covering the domains of mucosal immunology, histopathology, computational analysis, microbiome analysis and host immune responses. The skills learnt from this project will be critical for the capacity development of both the LMIC institution and the candidate herself.","Microbiota, Inflammation and Environmental Enteric Dysfunction (MiEED)",9549157,K43TW010697,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Bangladesh', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Birth', 'Career Mobility', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronology', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Community Developments', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Duodenum', 'Endoscopy', 'Enteral', 'Epithelium', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Gut Mucosa', 'Height', 'Histologic', 'Histopathologic Grade', 'Histopathology', 'Homeostasis', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunoglobulin A', 'Immunologist', 'Immunology', 'Impairment', 'Infiltration', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Institution', 'Intestinal permeability', 'Intestines', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lamina Propria', 'Link', 'Logistics', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malnutrition', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Milieu Therapy', 'Modeling', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Mus', 'Outcome', 'Pakistan', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sanitation', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Small Intestines', 'Structure', 'Support System', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Sustainable Development', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Villous', 'Washington', 'Weight', 'Work', 'aged', 'bacterial community', 'base', 'career', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'cytokine', 'drinking water', 'environmental change', 'experience', 'fecal microbiota', 'forest', 'global health', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'high risk', 'host microbiome', 'immune activation', 'immune function', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'intestinal villi', 'laboratory facility', 'learning strategy', 'low and middle-income countries', 'low income country', 'member', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiome analysis', 'microbiota', 'peripheral blood', 'postnatal', 'preclinical study', 'programs', 'rRNA Genes', 'skills', 'translational scientist']",FIC,AGA KHAN UNIVERSITY (PAKISTAN),K43,2018,62726,0.04254303503459196
"The relationship of fecal microbiomes and nutritional status in CF ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intestinal tract disease is responsible for a substantial amount of the morbidity and mortality among people with the genetic disease cystic fibrosis (CF). The manifestations of CF intestinal disease frequently occur during infancy and result from pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (PI), resulting in profound nutrient malabsorption and malnutrition, and consequently in growth failure and intestinal obstruction. Despite aggressive, early nutritional intervention with pancreatic enzyme replacement and other therapies, early growth failure remains common among infants with CF, suggesting that characteristics other than PI contribute to growth and nutritional failure in infants with CF. The identification of thes growth and nutritional determinants in children with CF therefore remains a key research goal in CF care. Recently, a clue to a potentially critical contributor to nutrient and energy uptake in children has emerged from the study of the microbes present in the gastrointestinal tract- the gut microbiota. Research has identified a complex relationship between gut microbiota, nutritional intake, nutrient absorption, and other health measures. GI tract microbes are known to contribute significantly to human nutrient metabolism and energy harvest, and they are altered in many disease states. Therefore, infant GI tract microbes may represent important determinants of CF nutritional outcomes, which in turn can significantly impact severity of lung disease and overall longevity. We recently showed that infants and children with CF had GI microbiota that differ markedly from those of children without CF, and that this dysbiosis correlated with severity of GI dysfunction. However, the relationships between CF GI microbiota with growth and other clinically important outcomes have not been studied. We hypothesize that the intestinal microbiomes among children with CF correlate with severity of malabsorption, intestinal inflammation, gastrointestinal signs and symptoms, vitamin and mineral deficiency, and nutritional status. To test these hypotheses, this ancillary study will define the fecal microbiomes of 250 infants with CF being enrolled in an ongoing multicenter study of infant nutrition (the Baby Observational NUtrition Study (BONUS), funded by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and the National Institutes of Health) using ultra high-throughput, culture-independent sequencing methods. With these resources, we will (1) define the fecal microbiomes, composed of the microbiota (the species of microbes present) and metagenomes (the microbial genes present, which reflects the metabolic capacity of the microbiota) of at least four stool samples per subject over the first year of life, and (2) determine the relationship of fecal microbiomes, and their evolution over the year of study, with nutritional and clinical parameters (including weight, height, body mass index, growth rate of each of these parameters among subjects, serum vitamin levels, fecal nutrient and metabolite content, GI symptoms, and measures of inflammation). We will use massively parallel next- generation DNA sequencing methods, combined with advanced bioinformatic analytical methods, with which we have extensive experience. Our goal is to define the role of the infant CF GI microbiome in growth and nutrition, with the hope of identifying interventions that will improve early growth, and thus long-term outcomes, in CF. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent scientific evidence suggests that the microbes that live in the gastrointestinal tracts of humans and other animals play key roles in the metabolism of nutrients, harvest of energy for the host, and the uptake of vitamins. Therefore, these microbes may be important contributors to diseases in which nutrients are poorly absorbed, the gastrointestinal tract is diseased, and/or the host grows poorly. The aim of this project is to determine the role of gastrointestinal microbes in the relentless and difficult-to-treat growth failure in children with the genetic disease cystic fibrosis, with the hope of both identifying interventions that will lead to better nutritional outcomes in these and in other children with poo early growth.",The relationship of fecal microbiomes and nutritional status in CF,9553779,R01DK095869,"['Address', 'Ancillary Study', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Genes', 'Bacteroides', 'Bioinformatics', 'Body mass index', 'Breast Feeding', 'Carbohydrates', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'DNA analysis', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Dietary intake', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Enrollment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evolution', 'Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency', 'Failure', 'Fat-Soluble Vitamin', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Genes', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Harvest', 'Health', 'Height', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Infant', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Intestinal Diseases', 'Intestinal Obstruction', 'Intestines', 'Leukocyte L1 Antigen Complex', 'Life', 'Life Expectancy', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Longevity', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malabsorption Syndromes', 'Malnutrition', 'Massive Parallel Sequencing', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microbiology', 'Micronutrients', 'Minerals', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Neonatal Screening', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional', 'Nutritional Study', 'Nutritional status', 'Observational Study', 'Obstruction', 'Outcome', 'Pancreatic enzyme', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'Proteobacteria', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Specimen', 'Study models', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Vitamins', 'Volatile Fatty Acids', 'Weight', 'absorption', 'analytical method', 'aqueous', 'candidate marker', 'children with cystic fibrosis', 'design', 'dosage', 'dysbiosis', 'early cystic fibrosis', 'enzyme replacement therapy', 'experience', 'fecal microbiome', 'fecal microbiota', 'gastrointestinal', 'gastrointestinal sign', 'gastrointestinal symptom', 'gene complementation', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'improved', 'infancy', 'infant nutrition', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'mortality', 'next generation', 'novel', 'nutrient absorption', 'nutrient metabolism', 'nutrition', 'public health relevance', 'routine care', 'stool sample', 'uptake']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2018,619708,0.0700545120731259
"Detecting Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Pediatric Emergency Department Care Using the PECARN Data Registry. Project Summary Understanding and eliminating racial and ethnic disparities in health care are national priorities. There is growing evidence that such disparities extend to the care of children. Our overall goals are to Detect, Understand, and Reduce racial and ethnic disparities in the emergency care of children. Through this proposal we will have the capacity to utilize the AHRQ funded Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) Registry, a comprehensive clinical registry of all pediatric emergency department (ED) visits from 7 EDs to detect racial and ethnic disparities in the management of children seeking care in the ED. Once we detect the magnitude of racial and ethnic disparities in health care provision, we can then seek to understand why such disparities exist, which can then inform interventions to reduce racial and ethnic disparities and achieve health equity. Through rigorous evaluation and use of multicenter comprehensive clinical data, this proposal will provide critical evidence and lay the framework for the next steps of our research mission - to develop and test interventions to reduce racial and ethnic disparities in the provision of pediatric emergency care. Project Narrative Eliminating racial and ethnic disparities in the provision of health services is a national priority. Since the emergency department (ED) is universally available for all children to access care, it is critically important to determine whether pediatric care in EDs is being delivered equitably. With this proposal, we intend to utilize the PECARN Registry, a large registry that contains comprehensive clinical data from all pediatric ED visits made to 7 EDs, to detect whether racial and ethnic disparities exist in health care delivery for children seeking care in the ED.

"PREDICTING OUTCOME IN CHILDREN WITH TIC DISORDERS USING NEUROIMAGING DATA DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As many as 25% of all children have tics (brief, repetitive movements or noises) at some point, yet individuals have greatly varying prognoses. Even within the first year after tic onset, some children improve and experience no significant impairment, while others develop a chronic disorder (Tourette syndrome: TS) that can severely impinge upon their quality of life. Understanding the brain features present early in the course of TS that mediate or predict these different outcomes could revolutionize prognosis and treatment. The purpose of this Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) is to provide the applicant with the training necessary to transition to independence with a research program focused on the brain mechanisms underlying TS and related disorders (e.g., attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: ADHD, obsessive-compulsive disorder: OCD). The applicant's long-term goal is to identify predictive biomarkers that can help guide prognosis and treatment. In order to achieve such goals, the applicant will receive unparalleled mentorship by experts in TS and neuroimaging methodologies (Drs. K. Black, B. Schlaggar, E. Sowell, R. Poldrack, and T. Hershey) and will have access to superb clinical and imaging resources at Washington University. The proposed training plan will enable the applicant to achieve several short-term goals necessary to facilitate her long-term goals, including new training in structural MRI methods, advanced analytic strategies, and longitudinal study design, and continued training in resting state functional connectivity MRI and in the clinical aspects of TS and its comorbid conditions. These training goals will be advanced through the proposed research. First, supervised learning methods will be used to identify patterns of brain structure and function that can classify an individual child as having TS or not, providing a principled starting point for exploring predictive biomarkers (Aim 1). Second, unsupervised learning methods will be used to identify brain-based phenotypic subgroups of TS, helping to better account for the heterogeneity of TS (Aim 2). Finally, supervised learning methods will be used to predict symptom progression for children when they first present with tics, using longitudinal follow-up of children during ther first year after tic onset (Aim 3). Thus, the proposed project is a first step toward brain- based individualized predictions for children with tics. Notably, the proposed methods can be extended to other childhood neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g., autism, ADHD), setting the stage for early treatment, as well as discovery of the underlying mechanisms. The longitudinal data collected as part of this award will be foundational for future R01 applications targeting the developmental trajectory of TS. The training and research plan proposed in this application will facilitate the applicant's transition to a unique and independent research career in translational developmental neuroscience. With a research program that employs multiple converging techniques and analysis methods to interrogate biomarkers of TS and related disorders, the applicant will continue to address research questions relevant to the NIMH throughout her independent career. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Up to 25% of all children have tics (i.e., repetitive, purposeless movements or noises) at some point, yet these individuals have tremendously varying prognoses. Within the first year after tic onset, some children experience marked improvement and no significant impairment, while others develop a chronic disorder that can severely impinge upon their quality of life. Therefore, tic disorders, including Tourette syndrome (TS), would benefit highly from individualized predictions. Understanding the brain features present early in the course of TS that mediate or predict different outcomes could revolutionize prognosis and treatment. The proposed project is a first step toward brain-based individualized predictions for children with tics. More generally, the proposed methods may give insights into how to approach other neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).",PREDICTING OUTCOME IN CHILDREN WITH TIC DISORDERS USING NEUROIMAGING DATA,9504522,K01MH104592,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'Base of the Brain', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early treatment', 'Flowcharts', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tic disorder', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Washington', 'analytical tool', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'career', 'clinical predictors', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'developmental disease', 'disease classification', 'endophenotype', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal design', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized predictions', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive marker', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K01,2018,144559,0.04289562942173087
"SCH: GEAR - Grounded Early Adaptive Rehabilitation ﻿PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions}: According to the 2010 US census (http://www.census.gov/prod/2011 pubs/acsbr1 0-12. pdf) 2.8 million school-aged children (aged 5 to 17) suffer from some form of mental and/or physical disability. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) guarantees such children equal access to education. However, children aged 1 to 5, while even more in need of early rehabilitation therapy and social interaction, do not receive the same attention. This proposal describes a plan for developing a new paradigm for pediatric rehabilitation. The paradigm involves robots that interact socially with special needs children, within a closed feedback control loop. Its components include new methods for modeling and representation of children motion, visual activity recognition, machine learning and behavior adaptation, and general-sum game-theoretic analysis of human-robot interaction. The research groups in the two collaborating institutions, University of Delaware (UD) and Johns Hopkins University (JHU), have produced preliminary results and evidence which suggest that the envisioned technical innovations in the domains mentioned above are feasible, and that physical implementation is possible.  There are three intertwined research thrusts in the proposed activity, that address specific long-standing challenges in each area: 1. pediatric rehabilitation: develop a robot-assisted, pediatric rehabilitation environment which combines motor training with social interaction; 2. computer vision and perception: develop interpretable perception and machine learning algorithms for adaptive activity recognition; 3. robot control: develop the control and coordination algorithms to enable directed and purposeful human-robot interaction. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Each year, 10 000 infants in the U.S. develop cerebral palsy and 4 000 infants have birth defects of the spine and the brain. The motor delays for these infants have lifelong consequences. This gap in mobility is a significant secondary impairment. We propose a new portable motor rehabilitation system with social robotic interfaces that maximizes rehabilitation dosage. The project will provide insights into motor development in special needs children suggesting a new early intervention paradigm for children with motor disabilities.",SCH: GEAR - Grounded Early Adaptive Rehabilitation,9348402,R01HD087133,"['Adaptive Behaviors', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Body part', 'Brain', 'Censuses', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Dancing', 'Data', 'Delaware', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disabled Persons', 'Early Intervention', 'Education', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Equipment', 'Feedback', 'Friends', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Human Activities', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Institution', 'Instruction', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Patients', 'Peer Group', 'Perception', 'Physical activity', 'Physically Handicapped', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'School-Age Population', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Socialization', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Transducers', 'Universities', 'Vertebral column', 'Visual', 'aged', 'base', 'catalyst', 'cognitive disability', 'computer game', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'disability', 'dosage', 'educational atmosphere', 'equipment training', 'human-robot interaction', 'innovation', 'insight', 'instructor', 'motor rehabilitation', 'neuromuscular', 'peer', 'personalized medicine', 'physical therapist', 'portability', 'robot assistance', 'robot control', 'skeletal', 'social']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE,R01,2017,477276,0.07858704806871286
"Evaluation of machine learning to mobilize detection and therapy of developmental delay in children Project Summary Access to diagnosis of autism and to invaluable early interventional therapy is severely hampered by the imbalance between the number of children needing care and the inadequate number of clinical practitioners who can deliver that care. This numerical imbalance is unlikely to change in the near future, and therefore there is an urgent need and an exciting opportunity to innovate new methods of care delivery that can appropriately empower caregivers of children at risk for or with a diagnosis of autism, and that capitalize on mobile tools and wearable devices. Using machine learning and large-scale data mining, we have built a mobile system to quantify and track the severity of autism that takes only minutes of a caregiver’s time and that has promise for repeat use at home due to its speed, accuracy and mobility. We have concomitantly developed a machine-learning system for automatic facial expression recognition that runs on Google Glass and delivers real time social cues to individuals with autism in that child’s natural environment. Our goal in this research program is to work with our clinical colleagues at Stanford’s Autism Center to test and refine these complementary machine-learning systems for accuracy and optimal use by families and their child with autism from their natural environments. We will then combine the two systems in a multi-month longitudinal trial designed to harness our mobilized machine learning tool to quantitatively measure the efficacy of our Autism Glasses as a therapeutic assistant that functions in real time and within the child’s natural environment. Our proposed experiments with at least 40 subjects at risk for developmental delay promise to demonstrate how to leverage digital health technologies to improve, mobilize and quicken the detection and treatment of autism. The work also will result in a new and unique dataset that validates the ability to bring the social learning process outside of the clinic and into the real world, leading to a faster, more fluid way for children with autism to gain social skills. We also expect our work to show how measurable indicators of behavioral improvement during therapy will facilitate the process of tracking progress on an increasingly more granular scale, and hopefully set the stage for more effective, precise and personalized treatment. Project Narrative There is a growing and striking imbalance between the number of clinical care providers and the number of children at risk for or managing an autism diagnosis, creating an urgent need to innovate new methods of care delivery that can appropriately empower caregivers and that capitalize on mobile tools and wearable devices. Our research proposal is focused on building two complementary machine learning tools – one for rapid, mobile measurement of the autism phenotype and one for at-home social learning on Google Glasses – that we believe will open the diagnostic bottleneck and provide a valuable form of behavioral therapy that can be used at home and outside of the clinical setting.",Evaluation of machine learning to mobilize detection and therapy of developmental delay in children,9297669,R21HD091500,"['Address', 'Age', 'Android', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Developmental Therapeutics Program', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Intervention', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Emotions', 'Employee Strikes', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Expression Recognition', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Technology', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Liquid substance', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Operating System', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Running', 'Schedule', 'Self-Direction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Work', 'behavior measurement', 'care delivery', 'clinical care', 'data archive', 'data mining', 'design', 'digital', 'experimental study', 'handheld equipment', 'human-in-the-loop', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'intervention program', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'prototype', 'social', 'social learning', 'social skills', 'stem', 'tool', 'trial design']",NICHD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R21,2017,196250,-0.014186203677752432
"Machine Learning Algorithms to Measure Physical Activity in Children with Cerebral Palsy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common physical disability of childhood with a prevalence of 2.5 to 3.6 cases per 1000 live births. Inadequate physical activity (PA) and poor fitness are major problems impacting the health and well-being of children with CP. Moreover, low PA may contribute to the development of disabling secondary conditions such as obesity, chronic pain, fatigue, and osteoporosis. Children with CP frequently undergo therapeutic interventions and/or orthopedic surgery to improve their mobility and increase habitual PA. The primary outcome measures used pre-post interventions are typically clinical measures of gross motor function or functional capacity. None of these tests, however, measure PA performance.  Accelerometry-based motion sensors are the method of choice for assessing PA in children. Our group has shown that accelerometers provide valid and reliable assessments of ambulatory activity in youth with CP. We have developed and validated CP-specific count thresholds to estimate time spent in sedentary, light-intensity, and moderate-to-vigorous intensity PA. However, there is a knowledge gap on optimal approaches in accelerometer data processing to measure PA in children with CP especially given the misclassification error and because cut-points do not perform well in children with more severe functional limitations.  The long-term goal of this project is to improve PA measures in children with CP. The overall objective of this application is to use machine learning in accelerometer data processing to improve PA measures in children with CP. The proposed study will be the first to develop, evaluate, and deploy machine learning algorithms to measure activity type and energy expenditure in children with CP. The specific aims of this project are to: 1) Develop and test machine learning algorithms to predict PA type, walking speed, and energy expenditure in ambulant children and adolescents with CP; 2) compare the accuracy of PA intensity estimates provided by machine learning algorithms to those provided by conventional cut-point methods; and 3) evaluate the performance of the resultant CP prediction models in an independent sample of children with Acquired Brain Injury (ABI).  The proposed project is in line with the NIH mission because the resultant prediction models will enable clinicians and rehabilitation professionals to more effectively monitor the PA levels of their patients to improve health and function. Improved objective measures of PA will also enable health researchers to better understand the short-and long-term health benefits of regular PA and impact of PA on adverse health conditions associated with CP. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research study is relevant to public health because it examines innovative machine learning approaches in measuring physical activity in ambulant children with cerebral palsy (CP); a condition that is the most prevalent physical disability of childhood resulting in compromised neuromuscular and musculoskeletal function with secondary co-morbidities (i.e., decreased fitness, functional mobility and physical activity), and increased health utilization and cost. Accurate, yet practical clinical physical activity measures to examine rehabilitation effectiveness for children with CP are currently unavailable, despite an emphasis on activity- based interventions to promote function and physical activity. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the NIH's mission in that it seeks to generate new knowledge on optimal physical activity measures and contribute this knowledge to clinical applications to measure physical activity outcomes in children with CP.",Machine Learning Algorithms to Measure Physical Activity in Children with Cerebral Palsy,9346616,R21HD086745,"['Acceleration', 'Accelerometer', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Adolescent', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain Injuries', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Child Behavior', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Engineering', 'Fatigue', 'Frequencies', 'Gait', 'Gait speed', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Live Birth', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedic Surgery procedures', 'Osteoporosis', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Physical activity', 'Physical assessment', 'Physical therapy exercises', 'Physically Handicapped', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Signal Transduction', 'Supervision', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'chronic pain', 'clinical application', 'computer science', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'experience', 'fitness', 'improved', 'innovation', 'light intensity', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuromuscular', 'novel', 'pediatric patients', 'post intervention', 'prediction algorithm', 'primary outcome', 'rehabilitation science', 'research study', 'sedentary', 'sensor', 'time use', 'vigorous intensity', 'walking speed']",NICHD,DREXEL UNIVERSITY,R21,2017,172086,0.1153374268159975
"A Data Science Approach to Air Toxics and Children's Environmental Health PROJECT SUMMARY: This proposal aims to characterize the associations between prenatal exposure to interpretable combinations of air toxics and children’s cognitive health through the efficient use of big public health data. With guidance from multidisciplinary advisors, the candidate will develop skills in data science, machine learning and advanced biostatistics to supplement her training in epidemiologic methods. This will allow her to progress in her career and advance research on combined environmental exposures and children’s health. Previous research has found associations between prenatal exposure to single air pollutants and children’s cognitive health but has lacked the ability to investigate combined impacts of multiple pollutants, including the synergistic/antagonistic interactions between pollutants that have been observed in experimental studies. Understanding the effects of combined exposures is a strategic goal of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, and the field of environmental health is transitioning from single-pollutant approaches to more holistic paradigms, such as the exposome. Identifying associations and interactions within the context of high-dimensional exposure data presents a computational challenge. Methods from domains such as data science, including machine learning methods, can be incorporated into the epidemiologic toolbox for addressing environmental mixtures and multiple exposures. The goal of this Career Development Award is to advance the candidate into an independent research career at the intersection of big data science and children’s environmental health. Through formal coursework, directed learning and field rotations, the candidate will gain skills in data science, machine learning and advanced biostatistics. Mentors, advisors and consultants have been selected for their complementary expertise, relevant research experience and mentoring abilities. The proposed research will leverage the skills gained from the training plan and apply them to characterize associations between prenatal exposure to interpretable combinations of air toxics and 3rd grade standardized test scores, a school-based measure of cognitive outcomes. Residence at birth will be used to link data on air toxics, a subset of air pollutants, to an administrative data linkage of public health registries and education data for approximately 220,000 children born in New York City from 1994-1998. The candidate will develop and validate a two-stage approach of hypotheses generation followed by targeted analyses in order to identify combinations of air toxics associated with children’s test scores within the context of high-dimensional exposure data (Aim 1). Targeted analyses using well-established epidemiologic methods for effect estimation and assessment of interaction between air toxics will be performed. (Aim2) Potential mediators of the relationship between air toxics and test scores can then be identified using statistical mediation and data science approaches. (Aim 3) Completion of these aims will uniquely position the candidate to conduct future research on combined environmental exposures and children’s health. PROJECT NARRATIVE Epidemiologic studies have shown that prenatal and/or early-life exposures to ambient air pollutants are associated with multiple measures of neurodevelopment and cognition in childhood. However, most of the previous studies characterized exposure using a single pollutant, even though ambient air is a complex mixture. This study will identify the combined effects of prenatal exposure to multiple air pollutants on children's standardized test scores within a large, representative population of urban children.",A Data Science Approach to Air Toxics and Children's Environmental Health,9313526,K99ES027022,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Air Pollutants', 'Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Monitoring', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Child', 'Child health care', 'Childhood', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Linkages', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development Plans', 'Distal', 'Education', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Information Systems', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'New York City', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Rotation', 'Schools', 'Selection Bias', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Technical Expertise', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Urban Population', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'early life exposure', 'epidemiological model', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'forest', 'genome wide association study', 'health data', 'high dimensionality', 'learning strategy', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurodevelopment', 'pollutant', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'research and development', 'residence', 'skills', 'third grade', 'urban children']",NIEHS,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,K99,2017,96716,0.04501189797897044
"The New Tics Study: A Novel Approach to Pathophysiology and Cause of Tic Disorders Project Abstract At least 20% of all children have tics at some time in their life, making tic disorders a subject of substantial public health interest. However, only about 3% of all children have tics that last for a year or more. Thus chronic tic disorders, including Tourette syndrome, can be conceptualized as a two- step process: tics start, and then they fail to remit. By the numbers, the second part of this process is the more unusual and perhaps more closely related to disease, yet surprisingly, almost no research has examined this critical period after a first tic appears but before it is clear whether the child will go on to have a chronic tic disorder. Therefore prior research that has identified abnormalities of brain structure and function in children with TS generally does not clarify whether these abnormalities are related to tic appearance or to the more important process of tic disappearance. Furthermore, tic disappearance can be observed prospectively, allowing powerful within-subject analyses to test whether features of brain structure or function shortly after tic onset predict remission of tics before TS is diagnosable, and whether such features are state-related or more durable markers of vulnerability to tics. Colleagues in the TS field have agreed that such studies would be valuable, but have suspected that recruitment would be extremely difficult. However, we have now demonstrated enrollment of subjects with New Tics (defined as beginning within the previous 6 months, median 3.6 months) at a rate of 16 subjects per year when recruitment efforts were at their peak—though still on a shoestring budget without full staffing or media advertisements. We have implemented subject preparation and quality control methods that have allowed us to acquire structural and functional MRI data of high quality in many subjects. We now propose to enroll an additional 70 subjects with New Tics and characterize them carefully at baseline and at the 1-year anniversary of tic onset (when TS can first be diagnosed). Both time points will include clinical data, structural and functional MRI, and neuropsychological measures including ability to suppress tics. We expect that complete data will be available for 55-70 subjects (including those already collected), since MRI is sensitive to movement and we are selecting for subjects with tics and additional difficulty holding still (about half of children with tics also have ADHD). We will compare baseline data from this sample to matched tic-free control subjects, and to matched subjects who already have TS or a chronic tic disorder (leveraging existing data in our laboratories to provide some of the clinical and MRI data for these groups). Analyses will include tests of specific a priori hypotheses as well as machine learning analyses of the complete dataset. These comparisons will allow us to discover whether imaging differences in children with TS are present long before TS can be diagnosed, whether they fade when tics improve, and whether they predict outcome in children with new tics. Investigation of this “pre-Tourette” population opens an entirely new window for etiologic discovery in tic disorders. It may also have important clinical consequences, if the results identify which newly- ticcing children are at highest risk for development of a chronic tic disorder. Public Health Relevance Statement At least 20% of all children have tics at some time in their life, making tic disorders a subject of substantial public health interest. In many children the tics will disappear before they've lasted as long as a year, but in others they go on to become Tourette syndrome or Chronic Tic Disorder (TS/CTD). Prior research generally has not clarified whether abnormalities of brain structure and function in children with TS/CTD are related to tic appearance or to the more important process of tic disappearance. This project will study children with recent-onset tics using clinical evaluation, MRI, and neuropsychological measures, and repeat these measures at the earliest time point that TS/CTD can be diagnosed. The results from the first assessment will be compared to results from two matching comparison groups: children with no personal or family history of tics, and children who have had tics for more than a year (Existing TS/CTD). This new approach may provide a new angle on research into Tourette syndrome, in addition to providing sorely needed information about prognosis for children who just started ticcing.",The New Tics Study: A Novel Approach to Pathophysiology and Cause of Tic Disorders,9311704,R01MH104030,"['Advertisements', 'Age', 'Anniversary', 'Appearance', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Budgets', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Family history of', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Image', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Neuropsychology', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Quality Control', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Rest', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Tic disorder', 'Time', 'brain abnormalities', 'caudate nucleus', 'comparison group', 'critical period', 'dexterity', 'follow-up', 'habit learning', 'high risk', 'improved', 'inattention', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'medical attention', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'phenomenological models', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'secondary analysis', 'vector']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,721638,0.09991584157417101
"Predicting Heterogeneous Neurodevelopmental Outcomes in School-age Children with Early Caregiving Adversities Project Summary Children with severe Early Caregiving Adversities (ECAs) are the most vulnerable to psychopathology as a result of prolonged neglect, abuse, and care disruptions that impact neurodevelopment. It is currently estimated that addressing ECAs would lead to a 29.8% reduction in worldwide psychiatric illness. Existing research, including findings from the original grant of this renewal, has demonstrated that there is a very strong link between ECA exposures and increased risk for psychopathology and altered neurodevelopment at the population level; and yet, given the heterogeneity in ECA populations, there is a critical gap in knowledge regarding how ECAs increase any specific risks to an individual child. The proposed research addresses this significant mental health problem by combining sophisitcated data-analysis methods that use experiential and phenotypic heterogeneity together with longitudinal neuroimaging and behavioral assessments in school-age children. This approach will increase precision when linking ECAs and child outcomes associated with the Research Domain Criteria constructs of Negative Valence and Cognitive Control Systems (NVS/CCS). The overarching goal of the present work is to create an explanatory model for the heterogeneous impact of ECAs on neurodevelopmental trajectories of NVS/CCS. This project's premise is that children exposed to ECAs have highly heterogeneous developmental histories as well as heterogeneous outcomes; therefore, prediction of ECA outcomes requires cutting-edge, sophisticated data analytic methods. We hypothesize that data-driven approaches will 1) more precisely define NVS/CCS outcomes for school-aged children with ECAs, and 2) provide a more robust explanatory model for links between ECAs and NVS/CCS trajectories. Aim 1A subtypes children with a history of ECAs based on 2.5-year developmental trajectories of NVS/CCS. 300 6-8 year old children (250 sampled from previous institutional and foster care; 50 community comparisons) will provide neuroimaging, behavioral, and self/caregiver reports every 15 months for 2.5 years. Biclustering methods will be applied to the baseline and follow-up data to identify homogeneous NVS/CCS final outcome clusters of children. Aim 1B develops an explanatory model to predict developmental trajectory subtypes for children with ECAs, from early life profiles and brain/behavior phenotypes at the time of enrollment. Machine learning methods applied to early life profiles, baseline NVS/CCS profiles, and sex, will predict developmental trajectory subtypes. Aim 2 identifies adverse and protective life events during the 2.5-year assessment period that are predictive of 2.5-year follow-up outcomes for children with ECAs. The inclusion of child-sex and current life- events will identify potential divergence in pathways across middle childhood. This prospective design of children exposed to various ECAs is designed to develop predictive models for ECA trajectory subtypes and outcomes, which can inform our understanding of risk and protective factors in accord with the goals of precision medicine.   Project Narrative Children with severe Early Caregiving Adversities (ECAs) are the most vulnerable to psychopathology, and it is estimated that addressing ECAs would lead to a 29.8% reduction in worldwide psychiatric illness. Existing research has demonstrated that there is a very strong link between ECA exposures and increased risk for psychopathology and altered neurodevelopment at the population level; and yet, given the heterogeneity in ECA populations, there is a critical gap in knowledge regarding how ECAs increase any specific risks to an individual child. The proposed research addresses this significant mental health problem by combining longitudinal multimodal brain imaging and high- dimensional behavioral assessments in school-age children together with sophisticated data analytic techniques to increase precision when linking heterogeneous ECAs and child outcome with the goal of predicting mental health outcomes and identifying children who would benefit most from specific early interventions.  ",Predicting Heterogeneous Neurodevelopmental Outcomes in School-age Children with Early Caregiving Adversities,9384268,R01MH091864,"['10 year old', '8 year old', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Catalogs', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Child Rearing', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Communities', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Decision Trees', 'Dependency', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Grouping', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Nature', 'Negative Valence', 'Orphanages', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathway interactions', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Psychopathology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'School-Age Population', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Violence', 'Visit', 'Work', 'abuse neglect', 'analytical method', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'caregiving', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive control', 'computerized', 'design', 'follow-up', 'foster care', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'middle childhood', 'multimodality', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'outcome prediction', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prepuberty', 'prospective', 'resilience', 'sex', 'socioeconomics']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R01,2017,782745,0.10922623473364844
"PREDICTING CHILDHOOD OUTCOMES IN PRETERM INFANTS USING CEREBRAL CONNECTIVITY DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Premature birth remains a major public health issue due to its continuing high incidence combined with the frequency of developmental impairments among surviving infants. In order to improve developmental outcomes in very preterm infants (VPT, born prior to 32 weeks' gestation), accurate and early identification of the alterations in brain development that lead to subsequent developmental impairment is required. The candidate for this K02 Independent Scientist Award is a uniquely trained pediatric neurologist who seeks to define the relationship between cerebral connectivity during infancy and childhood developmental outcomes. This project will involve a valuable, well-characterized VPT cohort (N=128) which includes high-risk children selected due to the presence of brain injury during the neonatal period. These children have undergone clinical characterization and MRI during the neonatal period and developmental assessment at age 2 years. They will now undergo standardized assessment of developmental outcomes at age 5 years. The central hypotheses are that VPT children will display a persisting range of motor and language difficulties, and that affected VPT children will display abnormalities on imaging measures obtained during infancy that predict childhood performance, both at the group and individual level, in these distinct and critical developmental domains. We propose to investigate these postulates by: 1) comprehensively evaluating childhood motor and language performance; 2) defining the relationship between alterations in domain-specific neonatal functional and structural connectivity and childhood motor and language outcomes; and 3) investigating differences in brain- wide cerebral connectivity in impaired VPT children using machine learning, pattern classification approach. The result will be characterization of the alterations in cerebral connectivity that underlie developmental disabilities in VPT children. In addition, we seek to develop highly valuable neuroimaging biomarkers that predict future motor and language impairment, enabling the provision of targeted care tailored to the needs of each individual infant. Finally, these tools will contribute to future, large-scale trials evaluating interventions designed to protect the developing brain. In pursuit of this goal, a focused career development program will complement the candidate's background in engineering and magnetic resonance methodology with training in developmental assessments and innovative image analysis approaches using applied mathematics, providing skills necessary to perform accurate longitudinal clinical research studies and develop individual prediction models. The supported activities will facilitate an NIH R-mechanism application centered upon innovative investigation of individual prediction models for developmental trajectories in VPT children during school-age, including repeat neuroimaging assessments during childhood. The culmination of these efforts will be transformative investigation that fosters improved outcomes for this high-risk population. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Despite continued high rates of disabilities in infants born prematurely, methods for accurately identifying those that would benefit most from specific therapies or protective interventions remain limited. This study is designed to improve our understanding of the alterations in brain function and structure that produce these deficits by using novel approaches to examine how magnetic resonance imaging data predicts early childhood outcomes. The goal is to identify imaging measures which identify preterm infants at risk for particular deficits, thereby allowing institution of timely therapies specific to each chid's needs and enabling larger research trials evaluating interventions designed to improve developmental outcomes in this vulnerable group.",PREDICTING CHILDHOOD OUTCOMES IN PRETERM INFANTS USING CEREBRAL CONNECTIVITY,9324377,K02NS089852,"['2 year old', '5 year old', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Caring', 'Cerebrum', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Disabilities', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Early identification', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Independent Scientist Award', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Institution', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Language Disorders', 'Lead', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Nature', 'Neonatal', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurologist', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Program Development', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'School-Age Population', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Survival Rate', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'career development', 'cohort', 'design', 'disability', 'early childhood', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'language impairment', 'motor deficit', 'motor impairment', 'neonatal brain', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'skills', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'white matter injury']",NINDS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K02,2017,137131,0.031835498577100094
"THE PRETERM BEHAVIORAL PHENOTYPE: TRAJECTORIES OF PSYCHOPATHOLOGY & CHANGES IN CEREBRAL CONNECTIVITY PROJECT SUMMARY: Children born prematurely are at elevated risk for psychiatric disorders, including ADHD, autism and anxiety. Indeed, the ‘preterm behavioral phenotype’ is comprised of inattention, anxiety and social- communication impairments. This constellation of comorbid disorders persists across the lifespan, accounting for long-term impairment and diminished quality of life among very preterm (VPT; born ≤32 weeks gestation) children, a population at high risk for altered brain development. Yet, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the increased prevalence of these symptoms remain undetermined. Further, VPT children face high exposure rates to deleterious psychosocial risk factors which have similarly been linked to adverse psychiatric outcomes and changes in brain development. We posit that decreased connectivity and the resulting diminished developmental trajectories within and across key functional networks (e.g., default mode, frontoparietal control and cingulo-opercular networks) and related white matter tracts (e.g., cingulum, corpus callosum and uncinate) underlie comorbid preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms that persist or worsen at age 9-10. This process begins during infancy and extends to middle childhood, with psychosocial risk playing an important modifying role. Advances in MRI methodology now enable characterization of structural and functional brain networks with unparalleled spatial and temporal resolution. Here, we couple these highly innovative, state-of-the-art MRI techniques with detailed psychiatric assessments to study our unique, sociodemographically-diverse longitudinal cohort of VPT and term-born children (N=302) with high rates of psychosocial adversity now reaching age 9-10. The cohort has been followed since birth, including prospective collection of high-quality neonatal functional and structural connectivity MRI data and longitudinal assessments of preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms and psychosocial and familial factors at ages 2 and 5, with >80% cohort retention to date at both assessment waves. Continued evaluation of this enriched cohort provides an opportunity to determine: 1) trajectories of preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms to define early indicators of later impairment enabling targeted interventions, 2) relationships between neonatal and age 9-10 functional and structural connectivity and these deficits, and 3) the modifying role of psychosocial adversity. Application of cutting-edge MRI acquisition and analysis methods, including machine learning approaches, enables unprecedented characterization of the effects of VPT birth on connectivity in the developing brain. We will extend these methods to delineate relationships between imaging measures and preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms, improving understanding of modifiable effects of early life exposures and psychosocial risk on psychiatric outcomes. These data are critical for developing individual- level neuroimaging, behavioral and psychosocial presymptomatic predictive models for adverse mental health outcomes, measures necessary to inform and evaluate treatments applicable during sensitive developmental periods which mitigate risks of psychopathology associated with prematurity and psychosocial adversity. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH This study is designed to improve our understanding of the changes in brain structure and function that underlie the elevated rates of inattention, anxiety and autism spectrum symptoms now increasingly recognized in prematurely-born children. Using cutting-edge magnetic resonance imaging methods, we will investigate these relationships in a unique, longitudinally-studied cohort of very preterm and term-born children with high rates of psychosocial adversity now reaching age 9-10 years and previously studied using neuroimaging during infancy and detailed assessments of psychiatric symptoms during early childhood. The overarching goal is development of new approaches for earlier, more accurate identification of children at risk for these disorders, enabling progress toward targeted interventions which improve outcomes by limiting risks for psychopathology associated with prematurity and psychosocial adversity.",THE PRETERM BEHAVIORAL PHENOTYPE: TRAJECTORIES OF PSYCHOPATHOLOGY & CHANGES IN CEREBRAL CONNECTIVITY,9469790,R01MH113570,"['Accounting', 'Age', 'Anisotropy', 'Anxiety', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Cerebrum', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Effect', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neonatal', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pattern', 'Perinatal', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Infant', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Survival Rate', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'associated symptom', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'early childhood', 'early life exposure', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'inattention', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'middle childhood', 'neonatal magnetic resonance imaging', 'neonate', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'premature', 'prospective', 'psychiatric disability', 'psychiatric symptom', 'psychosocial', 'sex', 'social', 'social communication', 'social communication impairment', 'targeted treatment', 'temporal measurement', 'white matter']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,613948,0.02504731526375336
"Verb learning and the early development of sentence comprehension DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Children use syntax to understand sentences and to learn verbs; this is syntactic bootstrapping. We proposed a Structure Mapping account of the origins of syntactic bootstrapping. On this account, children begin with an unlearned bias toward one-to-one mapping between nouns in sentences and participant-roles in events. Given this bias, children find the number of nouns in a sentence inherently meaningful. In the previous funding period, we tested key predictions of this account, and found strong evidence for structure-mapping. Identifying the set of nouns in sentences yields a partial representation of syntactic structure that allows toddlers to identify verbs, and to interpret novel transitive and intransitive verbs in simple sentences. The proposed research asks how syntactic bootstrapping moves beyond 'counting the nouns', scaling up to the true complexity of verbs and sentences. We focus on two data-sources: distributional learning and discourse structure. First, we propose that distributional learning creates probabilistic syntactic-semantic combinatorial knowledge about verbs. This combinatorial knowledge, also known as verb bias, permits syntactic bootstrapping, and from early in development is used online to help identify the structure and lexical content of sentences, guiding syntactic analysis. Second, we propose that a bias toward discourse continuity increases linguistic support for verb learning by allowing learners to collect evidence for arguments across nearby sentences. Verb bias guides this process, by cuing children to seek referents for missing arguments in the discourse context. To investigate these proposals we combine experiments with toddlers and preschoolers, and a computational model based on systems for automatic semantic role labeling. Experiments with children assess comprehension of familiar and invented verbs in sentences, by measuring children's visual fixations to relevant scenes or objects. Project 1 explores toddlers' encoding of syntactic-semantic combinatorial facts about verbs from listening experience. Project 2 explores toddlers' use of discourse context to guide sentence interpretation, constrained by verb bias. Project 3 asks to what extent verb bias in preschoolers changes with new distributional learning. In Project 4 we develop our computational model to investigate the same processes. Results from experiments with children constrain the features we equip the model to detect; we use the model to test the consequences of our claims for learning from corpora of natural child-directed speech. This combination of experimental and computational studies will advance scientific knowledge about how children learn their native languages, and guide the development of new, robust learning protocols that will be of use in automatic natural language processing. The proposed research will help us to understand how children learn the words and syntax of their native languages; such research will contribute to the detection and remediation of language delays, and to language pedagogy. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research will examine verb learning and the development of sentence comprehension, using a combination of experiments with toddlers and preschoolers, and a computational model of early sentence comprehension. Our findings should have considerable impact, for two main reasons: First, our work will shed light on how learners begin to find meaning in syntax, addressing long-standing and fundamental scientific questions about language development. Second, the findings should help us predict and understand the consequences of individual variations in the early language environment for language development: by studying how young children collect and use linguistic-distributional data about words, we can predict what kinds of data they need to make typical progress, and thus what kinds of early experiences might lead to risks for language difficulties.",Verb learning and the early development of sentence comprehension,9244818,R01HD054448,"['Address', 'Behavior', 'Child', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Language', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ocular Fixation', 'Participant', 'Play', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Semantics', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Toddler', 'Uncertainty', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'combinatorial', 'computer studies', 'early experience', 'expectation', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'lexical', 'novel', 'pedagogy', 'public health relevance', 'remediation', 'scale up', 'syntax', 'theories', 'word learning']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R01,2017,308492,-0.012583958327156744
"Novel Accelerometer Calibration and Validation in Children andAdolescents Summary Accelerometers have been embraced by the scientific community as valid and reliable physical activity (PA) assessment tools. This is especially true in some sub-populations, such as children, who lack the ability to self- report their behaviors. Tremendous progress has been made in the objective assessment of PA and sedentary behavior (SB). Several measurement challenges remain that limit our ability to identify; dose-response associations with disease and risk factors, prevalence and determinants of these important health behaviors, changes in behavior due to time and intervention efforts. To overcome these challenges, we propose novel calibration procedures that will leverage the richness of three axes of raw acceleration data during free-living calibration activities, from wrist- and hip-worn accelerometers. Consistent with current PA recommendations for youth, the proposed study will focus on calibrating and validating accelerometer output to quantify intensity and duration of PA and identifying specific predominant modes of activity (e.g., sedentary time, locomotion, and fine/gross motor activity). Our primary goal is to follow best-practices data collection and analysis procedures to develop a comprehensive set of accelerometer algorithms that will accurately and precisely estimate minutes of various intensities of PA and mode of activity from hip- and wrist-worn accelerometers in children and adolescents (18 months to 21 years old), using video recorded direct observation during free-living activities as the criterion measure. Narrative Accurate and precise estimates of physical activity, sedentary behavior, and patterns of those behaviors in youth are essential in order to identify changes in those behaviors and to inform related policy decisions. The proposed research will extend previous accelerometer calibration studies by videotaping free-living activities in a large sample across a wide age range of children and adolescents. The raw acceleration signals from both hip- and wrist-worn devices will be analyzed using linear regression and machine learning methods to generate a family of freely available algorithms that produce accurate and precise estimates, reducing inconsistencies and confusion on use of previous accelerometer cutpoints in youth.",Novel Accelerometer Calibration and Validation in Children andAdolescents,9308944,R01DK110148,"['21 year old', 'Acceleration', 'Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavior', 'Calibration', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Confusion', 'Controlled Environment', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Family', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Health behavior change', 'Hip region structure', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Linear Regressions', 'Locomotion', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Output', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Physical assessment', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Videotape', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'Youth', 'age group', 'base', 'behavior change', 'computerized data processing', 'disorder risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'response', 'sedentary', 'sedentary lifestyle']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST,R01,2017,339155,0.06274023999338837
"Development and Evaluation of an Evidence-Based Mobile Health Caregiver Intervention for FASD Project Summary/Abstract   Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) represent a major public health problem that affects up to 2 to 5

"Early understanding of multi-digit numbers Place value concepts and multi-digit numbers are the foundations of mathematics; however, many  children struggle at acquiring this knowledge. Poor understanding of the place value concepts has  been linked to difficulties in mathematics learning through the elementary and middle school  grades, and it is present not only for children with learning disabilities but also for a large  proportion of normally developing children. It is, thus, important to understand the developmental  mechanisms of multi-digit number learning and potential sources of early experiences that allow  some children to readily grasp the concepts while others continue to struggle. Recent research on place value concepts has suggested that children have partial knowledge of  multi-digit numbers at the preschool period, before receiving formal training from schools. These  precursors of multi-digit number knowledge can serve as important stepping-stones for children to  master the concept of place value once entering schools. However, there are at least two gaps in  our current understanding of the development  of place value concepts. First, how does early  understanding of multi-digit numbers relate to formal school training of the place value concepts?  Second, how do children come to acquire partial knowledge of multi-digit numbers at such a young  age in the first place? The goal of the proposed research aims at filling these gaps in the  literature with three specific aims. Aim 1 tests the hypothesis that early knowledge of multi-digit  numbers is predictive of later school learning of the place value concepts. I propose to conduct a  3-year longitudinal study to measure children’s early understanding of multi-digit numbers at the  start and end of kindergarten, 1st  and 2nd grades. The study will test how early knowledge of  number names and written numerals, as well as other individual difference measurements (e.g., age,  gender, SES, number sense, home exposures to numbers),  relate to the learning of base-10  principles in grade school. Aim 2 tests the hypothesis that acquiring early knowledge of  multi-digit numbers is a form of statistical learning, during which children extract latent  structures that govern the mapping between number words and written numerals through sparse  co-occurrence data. A training study is designed to give children casual experiences with  multi-digit numbers in engaging and child- friendly activities (e.g., picture-book reading, ipad  games). The same children in the statistical learning training will also be given formal school  training afterward, allowing us to assess and provide causal evidence for the hypothesis that early  knowledge prepares children for formal school training of the place value concepts. The knowledge  gained from this research will have implications for: a) determining the role of early knowledge of  multi-digit numbers in preparing children to learn about base-10 notation at schools; b) linking  statistical learning from sparse co-occurrence data about number words and multi-digit numbers to  early partial knowledge of place value; c) documenting how differences in early learning  environment (or input) may contribute to developmental inequalities in later school performances. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research aims at understanding the early development of multi-digit numbers, its learning mechanisms and its impact on formal school training of place value concepts. The period of development studied here, from 3 to 5 years of age, is a period during which sizable individual differences in multi-digit number knowledge starts to emerge, which may contribute to early developmental inequalities that limit the development of some children even after entering school. The proposed work is relevant to public health in that it will shed light on how differences in early learning environment lead to individual differences in early understanding of multi-digit numbers, potentially serving as the foundation for future early mathematical training programs.",Early understanding of multi-digit numbers,9394832,F32HD090827,"['5 year old', '6 year old', 'Age', 'Books', 'Child', 'Consequentialism', 'Correlation Studies', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Digit structure', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inequality', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Letters', 'Light', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Names', 'Nursery Schools', 'Only Child', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Preschool Child', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Work', 'base', 'design', 'early experience', 'educational atmosphere', 'elementary school', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'first grade', 'formal learning', 'grasp', 'junior high school', 'kindergarten', 'mathematical ability', 'mathematical learning', 'mathematics disability', 'second grade', 'socioeconomics', 'success']",NICHD,INDIANA UNIVERSITY BLOOMINGTON,F32,2017,56694,0.07681851940368907
"A Computational Biomechanical Airway Model for Obese Children at Risk for OSAS ABSTRACT Childhood obesity remains epidemic and is most prevalent in minorities. Obese children have a higher risk for developing obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) with an estimated prevalence of 50%, compared to the general pediatric population with a known prevalence of 2-4%. OSAS carries with it significant neurocognitive, cardiovascular, and metabolic derangements. Additionally, obese children do not respond well to treatment such as adenotonsillectomy or weight loss with residual OSAS exceeding 50%. Despite progress that has been made in recent years to understand the anatomical and functional attributes of OSAS in children, the precise mechanism leading to the disorder remains unknown in the majority of obese children, hindering the development of efficacious treatments. Thus, the overarching goal of this study is to implement state-of-the-art dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and image analytics using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and biomechanical modeling, to establish the biomechanical basis that leads to OSAS or protects from it, in naïve and treated children with obesity. NARRATIVE Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is a common and difficult to treat disorder in obese children and leads to significant medical consequences. We still do not understand why some obese children suffer from this disorder while other do not. The current study will use advance imaging analytical tools combined with biomechanical models to better understand the causes of the disorder and ways to improve outcomes of treatment in these children.",A Computational Biomechanical Airway Model for Obese Children at Risk for OSAS,9327032,R01HL130468,"['17 year old', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Biomechanics', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body mass index', 'Breathing', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Continuous Positive Airway Pressure', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dilator', 'Disease', 'Drops', 'Epidemic', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intercept', 'Intervention', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Muscle', 'Nasopharynx', 'Neurocognitive', 'Obesity', 'Object Attachment', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Oropharyngeal', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Property', 'ROC Curve', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Sleep', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tonsil', 'Treatment outcome', 'analytical tool', 'awake', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'longitudinal design', 'novel', 'obesity in children', 'pharyngeal critical pressure', 'pressure', 'respiratory', 'response', 'standard care', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,"ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, INC",R01,2017,757906,0.09895461521146323
"Development and Validation of an Automated Measurement of Child Screen Media Use: FLASH The obesity field is fraught with problems of measuring people's diet, physical activity and sedentary behaviors that are hindering the advancement of the field to find promising solutions for obesity prevention and treatment. An important example is screen media use, a prominent cause for sedentary time that has been linked to obesity and metabolic syndrome, as well as other unwanted physiologic, psychosocial, and academic outcomes in children. Given the important impact screen use has on children's health, our ability to measure the time children spend on screens is very limited. Current assessments typically rely either on (1) general questions estimating “typical use;” or self- or parent-report via screen use diaries, both which have reporting bias and recall bias; or (2) devises initially intended to restrict children's TV viewing (TV Allowance™), which may have intervention effects or miss-classify TV viewing time. While automatic and objective measures of physical activity have shown validity and reliability for quantifying children's physical activity, no system that is automatic, accurate and unobtrusive has been developed to assess children's screen use on different platforms. Advances in technology, such as person detection, accurate facial recognition based on images, and imaging, computer vision and signal processing algorithms now offer novel and promising solutions to objectively and automatically measure people's screen viewing behaviors. We will leverage these recent advances and integrate them to develop a first of its kind, in-home, unobtrusive, automatic, privacy preserving screen use monitoring system: Family Level Assessment of Screen use in the Home (FLASH) that uses an embedded computing platform connected to a video camera on larger, stationary screens (FLASH-TV); or functions as a background app using a front facing camera (FLASH-Mobile). Our trans-disciplinary group, consisting of behavioral researchers at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) and electrical engineers at Rice University, propose to develop and asses the validity of the FLASH to accurately identify whether and for how long a child is using screen media devices. In this multiple-PI application, the development of FLASH is led by engineers at Rice. Once a final system has been developed, alpha and beta tested, a validation study will take place in observation labs by the BCM behavioral researchers with 6-10 year old children for FLASH-TV and FLASH-Mobile (n=43). Comparisons of FLASH output will be made to staff observations of children participating in a set of structured predefined activities. Next FLASH will be assessed for feasibility and accuracy for identifying children's screen use across platforms in a naturalistic home setting (n=46), compared to direct observation and screen use diaries. This project has the potential of creating a paradigm shift in scientist's ability to assess the role screen use has on health outcomes or intervention effects of screen media reduction programs, similar to that of accelerometers for physical activity research. FLASH has the potential of having a significant impact on public health and clinical research regarding screen media use.   PROJECT NARRATIVE Higher levels of screen media use have been associated with obesity, metabolic syndrome and other unwanted health and psychosocial outcomes in children. Despite the recent attention screen use has received among public health and clinical circles, the measurement of screen use behaviors is very crude and inaccurate.

"Microbiota, Inflammation and Environmental Enteric Dysfunction (MiEED) PROJECT SUMMARY In this application, I am requesting support from a career development award to support my research proposal titled “Microbiota, Inflammation and Environmental Enteric Dysfunction”. I will be undertaking this work with the mentorship of Dr. Jeffrey Gordon (Primary US mentor) at the Washington University, St Louis and Dr. Asad Ali (Primary LMIC mentor) at the Aga Khan University. This project builds on our existing studies of Environmental Enteric Dysfunction (EED), funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The current application aims to improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of EED by studying the evolution of gut microbial configuration in children who have clinical and histological evidence of EED. EED is common in children living in impoverished conditions with limited access to clean drinking water and sanitation. Histopathological changes of EED in small bowel mucosa include alteration in crypt to villous ratio along with lymphocytic infiltration of the villous epithelium and lamina propria. Although studies involving biopsies of small bowel mucosa are critical to study EED, these studies are uncommon because of logistic challenges involving performing endoscopies in field settings in LMICs. We have previously demonstrated in an ongoing BMGF funded study that we are able to safely obtain such biopsies, we now have a unique opportunity to study the relationship between gut microbiome evolution and EED in this cohort. The central hypothesis of the current application is that children with histological confirmation of EED have shared features of a bacterial community which is different from healthy controls and non-EED subjects, and that such changes in bacterial configuration are associated with enteric and systemic inflammation. For testing these hypotheses, evaluation of gut microbiome in healthy and stunted children will be carried out to identify the age discriminatory bacterial taxa in children with and without confirmation of EED. Dr. Gordon will be providing mentorship and experience in gut microbiome and microbiota analysis. Dr. Ali will provide the needed infrastructure of the field site and laboratory facilities, along with linking the microbiome analysis with clinical and histological outcomes of interest. The Aga Khan University is a leading regional research institute with multiple support systems for junior investigators which will be vital for my career transition as an independent scientist. My long term goal is to be the principal investigator of my own laboratory, focusing on studying the gut microbiome and its relationship with communicable and non-communicable diseases. I envision working on microbiota derived therapy for EED, and to find targets in the inflammatory pathways driven by changes in gut homeostasis. PROJECT NARRATIVE Globally, Pakistan has the third highest rate of stunting among children aged < 5 years. Environmental Enteric Dysfunction (EED) is proposed to be a critical factor responsible for chronic growth faltering in children in resource limited settings. This research utilizes an innovative approach to study a program of postnatal gut microbiome development in children and its impact on child growth. This proposal will provide an ideal training platform for a translational scientist, covering the domains of mucosal immunology, histopathology, computational analysis, microbiome analysis and host immune responses. The skills learnt from this project will be critical for the capacity development of both the LMIC institution and the candidate herself.","Microbiota, Inflammation and Environmental Enteric Dysfunction (MiEED)",9402123,K43TW010697,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Bangladesh', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Birth', 'Career Mobility', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Child health care', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronology', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Community Developments', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Duodenum', 'Endoscopy', 'Enteral', 'Epithelium', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Height', 'Histologic', 'Histopathologic Grade', 'Histopathology', 'Homeostasis', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunoglobulin A', 'Immunologist', 'Immunology', 'Impairment', 'Infiltration', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Institution', 'Intestines', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lamina Propria', 'Link', 'Logistics', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malnutrition', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Milieu Therapy', 'Modeling', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Mus', 'Outcome', 'Pakistan', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Permeability', 'Phenotype', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sanitation', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Small Intestines', 'Structure', 'Support System', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Sustainable Development', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Villous', 'Washington', 'Weight', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'career', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'cytokine', 'drinking water', 'environmental change', 'experience', 'forest', 'global health', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'high risk', 'immune activation', 'immune function', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'intestinal villi', 'laboratory facility', 'learning strategy', 'low and middle-income countries', 'low income country', 'member', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'peripheral blood', 'postnatal', 'preclinical study', 'programs', 'rRNA Genes', 'skills', 'translational scientist']",FIC,AGA KHAN UNIVERSITY (PAKISTAN),K43,2017,57663,0.04254303503459196
"Predicting the early childhood outcomes of preterm brain shape abnormalities PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The last months of pregnancy are particularly important for the development of the child's brain, and the consequences of premature birth on its development can be substantial. Prematurely born children are at higher risk of various cognitive impairments and exhibits more behavioral disorders than full-term born children. Thus early detection and management of at risk children are essential. There is growing evidence of significant volumetric abnormalities in subcortical structures of premature neonates, which may be associated to negative long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. Understanding these abnormalities could help elucidate the underlying pathophysiology and enable early determination of at-risk patients, both of which would inform the design of novel treatment strategies. However, to date there is still a lack of sensitive, reliable, and accessible algorithms capable of characterizing the influence of prematurity on the anatomy of neonatal brain subcortical structures. In addition, few studies have looked directly at the long-term neurodevelopmental implications of these neonatal subcortical structures abnormalities. Predicting long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes early on – and preferably at neonatal ages – is likely to have a transformative effect on their outcome. Our preliminary data indicate significant morphological differences in the putamen, ventricles, corpus callosum, and thalamus between preterm and term neonates. We propose to develop biomarkers of prematurity by statistically comparing the morphological and diffusion properties of subcortical structures between preterm and term neonates using brain MRI. These results will further be used in a sparse learning framework to predict long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes of prematurity. Hypotheses: By combining subcortical morphological and diffusion properties, we will be able to: (1) delineate specific correlative relationships between structures regionally and differentially affected by normal maturation and different patterns of white matter injury, and (2) improve the specificity of neuroimaging to predict neurodevelopmental outcomes earlier. Aim 1: Build a new toolbox for neonatal subcortical structures analyses that combine 1) a group lasso-based analysis of significant regions of shape changes, 2) a structural correlation network analysis, 3) a neonatal tractography, and 4) tensor-based analysis on tracts. Aim 2: Ascertain biomarkers of prematurity in neonates with different patterns of abnormalities. Aim 3: Assess the predictive potential of imaging and clinical features on neurodevelopmental outcomes among premature children at 12 and 18 months and 6-8 years of age. Impact: This application will provide the first complete subcortical network analysis in both term and preterm neonates. In the first study of its kind for prematurity, we will use sparse and multi-task learning to determine which of the biomarkers of prematurity at birth are the best predictors of long-term outcome. The expected findings could improve our ability to predict these outcomes and enable the design of early treatments – before years of pathological brain development and symptoms occur. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH We propose to develop biomarkers of prematurity by statistically comparing the morphological and diffusion properties of subcortical structures between preterm and term neonates. A better understanding of the neurological biomarkers of prematurity will help promote early clinical management of prematurely born infants who are at higher risk of many neurodevelopmental deficits, including attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and various learning impairments (i.e. dyslexia, dysorthographia, dyscalculia).",Predicting the early childhood outcomes of preterm brain shape abnormalities,9397322,R01EB025032,"['8 year old', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain scan', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Cognitive', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dyslexia', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Exhibits', 'Functional disorder', 'Hearing', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Lasso', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Neonatal', 'Network-based', 'Neurodevelopmental Deficit', 'Neurologic', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Problem behavior', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain shape', 'caudate nucleus', 'design', 'early childhood', 'high risk', 'imaging potential', 'improved', 'interest', 'lateral ventricle', 'mathematics disability', 'morphometry', 'multitask', 'neonatal brain', 'neonate', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'premature', 'premature neonates', 'preterm newborn', 'putamen', 'social communication', 'tractography', 'treatment strategy', 'vector', 'white matter', 'white matter injury']",NIBIB,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OF LOS ANGELES,R01,2017,435809,0.013576843711666734
"The relationship of fecal microbiomes and nutritional status in CF ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intestinal tract disease is responsible for a substantial amount of the morbidity and mortality among people with the genetic disease cystic fibrosis (CF). The manifestations of CF intestinal disease frequently occur during infancy and result from pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (PI), resulting in profound nutrient malabsorption and malnutrition, and consequently in growth failure and intestinal obstruction. Despite aggressive, early nutritional intervention with pancreatic enzyme replacement and other therapies, early growth failure remains common among infants with CF, suggesting that characteristics other than PI contribute to growth and nutritional failure in infants with CF. The identification of thes growth and nutritional determinants in children with CF therefore remains a key research goal in CF care. Recently, a clue to a potentially critical contributor to nutrient and energy uptake in children has emerged from the study of the microbes present in the gastrointestinal tract- the gut microbiota. Research has identified a complex relationship between gut microbiota, nutritional intake, nutrient absorption, and other health measures. GI tract microbes are known to contribute significantly to human nutrient metabolism and energy harvest, and they are altered in many disease states. Therefore, infant GI tract microbes may represent important determinants of CF nutritional outcomes, which in turn can significantly impact severity of lung disease and overall longevity. We recently showed that infants and children with CF had GI microbiota that differ markedly from those of children without CF, and that this dysbiosis correlated with severity of GI dysfunction. However, the relationships between CF GI microbiota with growth and other clinically important outcomes have not been studied. We hypothesize that the intestinal microbiomes among children with CF correlate with severity of malabsorption, intestinal inflammation, gastrointestinal signs and symptoms, vitamin and mineral deficiency, and nutritional status. To test these hypotheses, this ancillary study will define the fecal microbiomes of 250 infants with CF being enrolled in an ongoing multicenter study of infant nutrition (the Baby Observational NUtrition Study (BONUS), funded by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and the National Institutes of Health) using ultra high-throughput, culture-independent sequencing methods. With these resources, we will (1) define the fecal microbiomes, composed of the microbiota (the species of microbes present) and metagenomes (the microbial genes present, which reflects the metabolic capacity of the microbiota) of at least four stool samples per subject over the first year of life, and (2) determine the relationship of fecal microbiomes, and their evolution over the year of study, with nutritional and clinical parameters (including weight, height, body mass index, growth rate of each of these parameters among subjects, serum vitamin levels, fecal nutrient and metabolite content, GI symptoms, and measures of inflammation). We will use massively parallel next- generation DNA sequencing methods, combined with advanced bioinformatic analytical methods, with which we have extensive experience. Our goal is to define the role of the infant CF GI microbiome in growth and nutrition, with the hope of identifying interventions that will improve early growth, and thus long-term outcomes, in CF. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent scientific evidence suggests that the microbes that live in the gastrointestinal tracts of humans and other animals play key roles in the metabolism of nutrients, harvest of energy for the host, and the uptake of vitamins. Therefore, these microbes may be important contributors to diseases in which nutrients are poorly absorbed, the gastrointestinal tract is diseased, and/or the host grows poorly. The aim of this project is to determine the role of gastrointestinal microbes in the relentless and difficult-to-treat growth failure in children with the genetic disease cystic fibrosis, with the hope of both identifying interventions that will lead to better nutritional outcomes in these and in other children with poo early growth.",The relationship of fecal microbiomes and nutritional status in CF,9349480,R01DK095869,"['Address', 'Ancillary Study', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Genes', 'Bacteroides', 'Bioinformatics', 'Body mass index', 'Breast Feeding', 'Carbohydrates', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'DNA analysis', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Dietary intake', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Enrollment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evolution', 'Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency', 'Failure', 'Fat-Soluble Vitamin', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Feces', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Harvest', 'Health', 'Height', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Infant', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Intestinal Diseases', 'Intestinal Obstruction', 'Intestines', 'Leukocyte L1 Antigen Complex', 'Life', 'Life Expectancy', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Longevity', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malabsorption Syndromes', 'Malnutrition', 'Massive Parallel Sequencing', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microbiology', 'Micronutrients', 'Minerals', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Neonatal Screening', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional', 'Nutritional Study', 'Nutritional status', 'Observational Study', 'Obstruction', 'Outcome', 'Pancreatic enzyme', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'Proteobacteria', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Specimen', 'Study models', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Vitamins', 'Volatile Fatty Acids', 'Weight', 'absorption', 'analytical method', 'aqueous', 'candidate marker', 'children with cystic fibrosis', 'design', 'dosage', 'early cystic fibrosis', 'enzyme replacement therapy', 'experience', 'gastrointestinal', 'gastrointestinal sign', 'gastrointestinal symptom', 'gene complementation', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'improved', 'infancy', 'infant nutrition', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'mortality', 'next generation', 'novel', 'nutrient absorption', 'nutrient metabolism', 'nutrition', 'public health relevance', 'routine care', 'uptake']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2017,619708,0.0700545120731259
"Detecting Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Pediatric Emergency Department Care Using the PECARN Data Registry. Project Summary Understanding and eliminating racial and ethnic disparities in health care are national priorities. There is growing evidence that such disparities extend to the care of children. Our overall goals are to Detect, Understand, and Reduce racial and ethnic disparities in the emergency care of children. Through this proposal we will have the capacity to utilize the AHRQ funded Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) Registry, a comprehensive clinical registry of all pediatric emergency department (ED) visits from 7 EDs to detect racial and ethnic disparities in the management of children seeking care in the ED. Once we detect the magnitude of racial and ethnic disparities in health care provision, we can then seek to understand why such disparities exist, which can then inform interventions to reduce racial and ethnic disparities and achieve health equity. Through rigorous evaluation and use of multicenter comprehensive clinical data, this proposal will provide critical evidence and lay the framework for the next steps of our research mission - to develop and test interventions to reduce racial and ethnic disparities in the provision of pediatric emergency care. Project Narrative Eliminating racial and ethnic disparities in the provision of health services is a national priority. Since the emergency department (ED) is universally available for all children to access care, it is critically important to determine whether pediatric care in EDs is being delivered equitably.

"SCH: GEAR - Grounded Early Adaptive Rehabilitation ﻿PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions}: According to the 2010 US census (http://www.census.gov/prod/2011 pubs/acsbr1 0-12. pdf) 2.8 million school-aged children (aged 5 to 17) suffer from some form of mental and/or physical disability. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) guarantees such children equal access to education. However, children aged 1 to 5, while even more in need of early rehabilitation therapy and social interaction, do not receive the same attention. This proposal describes a plan for developing a new paradigm for pediatric rehabilitation. The paradigm involves robots that interact socially with special needs children, within a closed feedback control loop. Its components include new methods for modeling and representation of children motion, visual activity recognition, machine learning and behavior adaptation, and general-sum game-theoretic analysis of human-robot interaction. The research groups in the two collaborating institutions, University of Delaware (UD) and Johns Hopkins University (JHU), have produced preliminary results and evidence which suggest that the envisioned technical innovations in the domains mentioned above are feasible, and that physical implementation is possible.  There are three intertwined research thrusts in the proposed activity, that address specific long-standing challenges in each area: 1. pediatric rehabilitation: develop a robot-assisted, pediatric rehabilitation environment which combines motor training with social interaction; 2. computer vision and perception: develop interpretable perception and machine learning algorithms for adaptive activity recognition; 3. robot control: develop the control and coordination algorithms to enable directed and purposeful human-robot interaction. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Each year, 10 000 infants in the U.S. develop cerebral palsy and 4 000 infants have birth defects of the spine and the brain. The motor delays for these infants have lifelong consequences. This gap in mobility is a significant secondary impairment. We propose a new portable motor rehabilitation system with social robotic interfaces that maximizes rehabilitation dosage. The project will provide insights into motor development in special needs children suggesting a new early intervention paradigm for children with motor disabilities.",SCH: GEAR - Grounded Early Adaptive Rehabilitation,9146176,R01HD087133,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Body part', 'Brain', 'Censuses', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Dancing', 'Data', 'Delaware', 'Development', 'Disabled Persons', 'Early Intervention', 'Education', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Equipment', 'Feedback', 'Friends', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Human Activities', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Institution', 'Instruction', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Patients', 'Peer Group', 'Perception', 'Physical activity', 'Physically Handicapped', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'School-Age Population', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Socialization', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Transducers', 'Universities', 'Vertebral column', 'Visual', 'Visual Motion', 'Weight', 'aged', 'base', 'catalyst', 'cognitive disability', 'computer game', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'disability', 'dosage', 'educational atmosphere', 'equipment training', 'human-robot interaction', 'innovation', 'insight', 'instructor', 'learned behavior', 'meetings', 'motor rehabilitation', 'neuromuscular', 'peer', 'personalized medicine', 'physical therapist', 'robot assistance', 'robot control', 'skeletal', 'social', 'technology training']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE,R01,2016,477724,0.07858704806871286
"Machine Learning Algorithms to Measure Physical Activity in Children with Cerebral Palsy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common physical disability of childhood with a prevalence of 2.5 to 3.6 cases per 1000 live births. Inadequate physical activity (PA) and poor fitness are major problems impacting the health and well-being of children with CP. Moreover, low PA may contribute to the development of disabling secondary conditions such as obesity, chronic pain, fatigue, and osteoporosis. Children with CP frequently undergo therapeutic interventions and/or orthopedic surgery to improve their mobility and increase habitual PA. The primary outcome measures used pre-post interventions are typically clinical measures of gross motor function or functional capacity. None of these tests, however, measure PA performance.  Accelerometry-based motion sensors are the method of choice for assessing PA in children. Our group has shown that accelerometers provide valid and reliable assessments of ambulatory activity in youth with CP. We have developed and validated CP-specific count thresholds to estimate time spent in sedentary, light-intensity, and moderate-to-vigorous intensity PA. However, there is a knowledge gap on optimal approaches in accelerometer data processing to measure PA in children with CP especially given the misclassification error and because cut-points do not perform well in children with more severe functional limitations.  The long-term goal of this project is to improve PA measures in children with CP. The overall objective of this application is to use machine learning in accelerometer data processing to improve PA measures in children with CP. The proposed study will be the first to develop, evaluate, and deploy machine learning algorithms to measure activity type and energy expenditure in children with CP. The specific aims of this project are to: 1) Develop and test machine learning algorithms to predict PA type, walking speed, and energy expenditure in ambulant children and adolescents with CP; 2) compare the accuracy of PA intensity estimates provided by machine learning algorithms to those provided by conventional cut-point methods; and 3) evaluate the performance of the resultant CP prediction models in an independent sample of children with Acquired Brain Injury (ABI).  The proposed project is in line with the NIH mission because the resultant prediction models will enable clinicians and rehabilitation professionals to more effectively monitor the PA levels of their patients to improve health and function. Improved objective measures of PA will also enable health researchers to better understand the short-and long-term health benefits of regular PA and impact of PA on adverse health conditions associated with CP. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research study is relevant to public health because it examines innovative machine learning approaches in measuring physical activity in ambulant children with cerebral palsy (CP); a condition that is the most prevalent physical disability of childhood resulting in compromised neuromuscular and musculoskeletal function with secondary co-morbidities (i.e., decreased fitness, functional mobility and physical activity), and increased health utilization and cost. Accurate, yet practical clinical physical activity measures to examine rehabilitation effectiveness for children with CP are currently unavailable, despite an emphasis on activity- based interventions to promote function and physical activity. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the NIH's mission in that it seeks to generate new knowledge on optimal physical activity measures and contribute this knowledge to clinical applications to measure physical activity outcomes in children with CP.",Machine Learning Algorithms to Measure Physical Activity in Children with Cerebral Palsy,9180261,R21HD086745,"['Acceleration', 'Accelerometer', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Adolescent', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain Injuries', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Child Behavior', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Engineering', 'Fatigue', 'Frequencies', 'Gait', 'Gait speed', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Live Birth', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedic Surgery procedures', 'Osteoporosis', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Physical activity', 'Physical therapy exercises', 'Physically Handicapped', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Signal Transduction', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'chronic pain', 'clinical application', 'computer science', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'experience', 'fitness', 'improved', 'innovation', 'light intensity', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuromuscular', 'novel', 'pediatric patients', 'post intervention', 'prediction algorithm', 'primary outcome', 'rehabilitation science', 'research study', 'sedentary', 'sensor', 'time use', 'vigorous intensity', 'walking speed']",NICHD,DREXEL UNIVERSITY,R21,2016,221705,0.1153374268159975
"PREDICTING OUTCOME IN CHILDREN WITH NEW-ONSET TICS USING NEUROIMAGING DATA ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Childhood onset neuropsychiatric disorders are often debilitating and are increasing in prevalence. Tourette Syndrome/Chronic Tic Disorder (TS/CTD), we propose, has a course that lends itself especially well to discovering optimal strategies for early diagnosis and prevention of developmental disorders. Common clinical practice and epidemiological data suggest that a large fraction (10-25%) of all children manifest motor and/or vocal tics at some age. Yet only 1-3% of all children have tics for the full year required for diagnosis of TS/CTD. The objective of the proposed research is to understand the structural and functional neuroimaging features of children with new-onset tics (""New Tics""), as the neurobiology of this population has not been investigated. Studying children with New Tics should provide the most leverage in understanding why tics remit in some children but not others. This proposal compares neuroimaging features of New Tics to TS/CTD and to controls, implements machine-learning tools to predict whether children with New Tics will remit or develop TS/CTD, and utilizes longitudinal scans to identify within-subject changes that occur as tics remit or persist.  The proposed study will apply resting-state functional connectivity MRI (rs fcMRI) and structural MRI methods to investigate children with New Tics. Neuroimaging will be conducted on children with current, new- onset tics, and comparisons will be made to existing MRI data from children with diagnosed TS/CTD and controls. Follow-up evaluation (1 year after tic onset) of New Tics will allow us to identify which children's tics remitted completely and whic were actually in the earliest stages of TS/CTD, thus sorting this group into Remitted Tics and Converted TS/CTD subgroups. Based on the epidemiological data, we expect most of New Tics subjects to fall in the Remitted Tics subgroup. Longitudinal scans of the New Tics children will enable us to assess within-subject changes that occur with remittance or persistence of tics. This study will also apply machine learning tools, specifically Support Vector Machines (SVMs), to characterize features that distinguish Remitted Tics and Existing TS/CTD groups. Those features will then be used to predict whether tics in the New Tics group will remit (Remitted Tics) or persist (Converted TS/CTD) on an individual patient basis. Thus, we will be poised to identify differences, and potentially early predictors, of remittance and TS/CTD.  This study will provide innovative, important data on a common clinical presentation: the child with New Tics. Completing our aims successfully will allow individual prediction of remission or progression, or at least will allow a New Tics sample to be enriched for high risk of developing TS/CTD, which would make prevention studies for TS/CTD feasible. We will also gain insight into the neurobiology of New Tics. Finally, this study is an essential first step towards a definitive longitudinal study that can improve diagnostic accuracy and settle questions of cause and effect. With successful completion of our aims, similar methods can be applied to other childhood onset neuropsychiatric disorders, setting the stage for early treatment or prevention of chronicity. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Roughly 1 out of 5 school age children will develop tics, i.e. repetitive, purposeless movements or noises. However, only about 3% of all children have a chronic tic disorder, such as Tourette syndrome (TS), so tics are transient (lasting less than 1 year) in most children with tics. Tics can cause significant morbidity and adversely affect quality of life. It is of great clinical and scientific interest to be able to predict which child with newonset of tics will go on to have morbidity from chronic tics, and understanding of the neurobiology of transient tics has an excellent chance of improving our ability to manage these patients and perhaps even prevent development of TS. More generally, this approach may give insights into how to approach other neurodevelopmental disorders such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or autism.",PREDICTING OUTCOME IN CHILDREN WITH NEW-ONSET TICS USING NEUROIMAGING DATA,8995710,R21NS091635,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain region', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Course', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease remission', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Opinion', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Remittance', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'School-Age Population', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Staging', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Tic disorder', 'Transient Tics', 'Vocal Tics', 'Weight', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disorder control', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'predict clinical outcome', 'prevent', 'tool', 'unpublished works']",NINDS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2016,190625,0.1150192887200291
"Real-Time Prediction of Acute Arrest in Infants with Single Ventricle Physiology ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Each year in the US, there are thousands of children who are born with a severe congenital deformation, where one of the two ventricles in the heart is severely underdeveloped. If they survive infancy, these children can go on to live full and normal lives. The mortality rate for this condition is 15%, and 63% of these deaths are due to cardio-respiratory arrests. This alarming rate of arrest events persists despite vigilant ICU care with the best available intensive monitoring equipment. Our overall goal is to improve current patient monitoring systems by developing machine learning algorithms that can predict the onset of an arrest event, hours before it occurs. This early warning indication can be provided to nurses and doctors who can intervene to prevent these life-threatening events from occurring, improving outcomes for these critically ill children. Preliminary studies at Texas Children's Hospital have resulted in a computer algorithm that can estimate the odds of arrest in single ventricle children, 1-2 hours prior to overt symptoms. The algorithm is based on a logistic regression risk model, and was developed using over 55,000 hours of vital sign observations. The specific aims of the proposed research are: (1) To test the hypothesis that this computer algorithm can provide an early warning of arrest, with sufficient accuracy for clinical use; (2) To improve the performance of this algorithm by incorporating additional sensor technologies; (3) To understand the relationship between the risk score provided by this algorithm and other post-surgical complications that commonly occur in these children during the their hospitalization. Aim 1 is a validation study of this algorithm on a large, prospective, and independent cohort, in order to measure its true predictive performance. Performance metrics to be measured will be the ROC area and positive and negative likelihood ratios. This will help us determine the optimal threshold for the detection of an arrest event. Aims 2 and 3 focus on improving the detection accuracy of the algorithm using Near Infrared Reflectance Spectroscopy (NIRS) monitoring, and relating the risk of arrest to outcomes such as mechanical circulatory support, re-operation, arrhythmia, and necrotizing enterocolitis. Successful completion of these aims will result in the first clinically validated, real- time early warning system for anticipating acute arrest events in children with single ventricle physiology. The techniques and technologies developed in this work are immediately translatable to other diseases and conditions for both adults and children. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Thousands of children each year are born in the US with only a single functional ventricle, putting them at substantial risk of acute cardiac arrest and ultimately death. This project will validate a new monitoring technology which can predict the onset of arrest 1-2 hours before it occurs in this population. This technology will provide nurses and doctors the valuable time that they need to mitigate problems leading up to arrest before these problems become life threatening, improving the chance of survival for these critically ill children.",Real-Time Prediction of Acute Arrest in Infants with Single Ventricle Physiology,9324456,R56HL131574,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Common Ventricle', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computers', 'Critically ill children', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Equipment', 'Event', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hospitalization', 'Hour', 'Infant', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Necrotizing Enterocolitis', 'Nurses', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Palliative Surgery', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Monitoring System', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Postoperative Period', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severity of illness', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Staging', 'Surgical complication', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'base', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'design', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'infancy', 'mortality', 'operation', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'repaired', 'respiratory', 'sensor', 'technology/technique', 'validation studies']",NHLBI,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R56,2016,277123,0.1031665665351055
"PREDICTING CHILDHOOD OUTCOMES IN PRETERM INFANTS USING CEREBRAL CONNECTIVITY DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Premature birth remains a major public health issue due to its continuing high incidence combined with the frequency of developmental impairments among surviving infants. In order to improve developmental outcomes in very preterm infants (VPT, born prior to 32 weeks' gestation), accurate and early identification of the alterations in brain development that lead to subsequent developmental impairment is required. The candidate for this K02 Independent Scientist Award is a uniquely trained pediatric neurologist who seeks to define the relationship between cerebral connectivity during infancy and childhood developmental outcomes. This project will involve a valuable, well-characterized VPT cohort (N=128) which includes high-risk children selected due to the presence of brain injury during the neonatal period. These children have undergone clinical characterization and MRI during the neonatal period and developmental assessment at age 2 years. They will now undergo standardized assessment of developmental outcomes at age 5 years. The central hypotheses are that VPT children will display a persisting range of motor and language difficulties, and that affected VPT children will display abnormalities on imaging measures obtained during infancy that predict childhood performance, both at the group and individual level, in these distinct and critical developmental domains. We propose to investigate these postulates by: 1) comprehensively evaluating childhood motor and language performance; 2) defining the relationship between alterations in domain-specific neonatal functional and structural connectivity and childhood motor and language outcomes; and 3) investigating differences in brain- wide cerebral connectivity in impaired VPT children using machine learning, pattern classification approach. The result will be characterization of the alterations in cerebral connectivity that underlie developmental disabilities in VPT children. In addition, we seek to develop highly valuable neuroimaging biomarkers that predict future motor and language impairment, enabling the provision of targeted care tailored to the needs of each individual infant. Finally, these tools will contribute to future, large-scale trials evaluating interventions designed to protect the developing brain. In pursuit of this goal, a focused career development program will complement the candidate's background in engineering and magnetic resonance methodology with training in developmental assessments and innovative image analysis approaches using applied mathematics, providing skills necessary to perform accurate longitudinal clinical research studies and develop individual prediction models. The supported activities will facilitate an NIH R-mechanism application centered upon innovative investigation of individual prediction models for developmental trajectories in VPT children during school-age, including repeat neuroimaging assessments during childhood. The culmination of these efforts will be transformative investigation that fosters improved outcomes for this high-risk population. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Despite continued high rates of disabilities in infants born prematurely, methods for accurately identifying those that would benefit most from specific therapies or protective interventions remain limited. This study is designed to improve our understanding of the alterations in brain function and structure that produce these deficits by using novel approaches to examine how magnetic resonance imaging data predicts early childhood outcomes. The goal is to identify imaging measures which identify preterm infants at risk for particular deficits, thereby allowing institution of timely therapies specific to each chid's needs and enabling larger research trials evaluating interventions designed to improve developmental outcomes in this vulnerable group.",PREDICTING CHILDHOOD OUTCOMES IN PRETERM INFANTS USING CEREBRAL CONNECTIVITY,9118361,K02NS089852,"['2 year old', '5 year old', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Caring', 'Cerebrum', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Disabilities', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Early identification', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Independent Scientist Award', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Institution', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Language Disorders', 'Lead', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Nature', 'Neonatal', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurologist', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'School-Age Population', 'Structure', 'Survival Rate', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'career development', 'cohort', 'design', 'disability', 'early childhood', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'language impairment', 'motor deficit', 'motor impairment', 'neonatal brain', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prospective', 'research study', 'skills', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'white matter injury']",NINDS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K02,2016,191131,0.031835498577100094
"Verb learning and the early development of sentence comprehension DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Children use syntax to understand sentences and to learn verbs; this is syntactic bootstrapping. We proposed a Structure Mapping account of the origins of syntactic bootstrapping. On this account, children begin with an unlearned bias toward one-to-one mapping between nouns in sentences and participant-roles in events. Given this bias, children find the number of nouns in a sentence inherently meaningful. In the previous funding period, we tested key predictions of this account, and found strong evidence for structure-mapping. Identifying the set of nouns in sentences yields a partial representation of syntactic structure that allows toddlers to identify verbs, and to interpret novel transitive and intransitive verbs in simple sentences. The proposed research asks how syntactic bootstrapping moves beyond 'counting the nouns', scaling up to the true complexity of verbs and sentences. We focus on two data-sources: distributional learning and discourse structure. First, we propose that distributional learning creates probabilistic syntactic-semantic combinatorial knowledge about verbs. This combinatorial knowledge, also known as verb bias, permits syntactic bootstrapping, and from early in development is used online to help identify the structure and lexical content of sentences, guiding syntactic analysis. Second, we propose that a bias toward discourse continuity increases linguistic support for verb learning by allowing learners to collect evidence for arguments across nearby sentences. Verb bias guides this process, by cuing children to seek referents for missing arguments in the discourse context. To investigate these proposals we combine experiments with toddlers and preschoolers, and a computational model based on systems for automatic semantic role labeling. Experiments with children assess comprehension of familiar and invented verbs in sentences, by measuring children's visual fixations to relevant scenes or objects. Project 1 explores toddlers' encoding of syntactic-semantic combinatorial facts about verbs from listening experience. Project 2 explores toddlers' use of discourse context to guide sentence interpretation, constrained by verb bias. Project 3 asks to what extent verb bias in preschoolers changes with new distributional learning. In Project 4 we develop our computational model to investigate the same processes. Results from experiments with children constrain the features we equip the model to detect; we use the model to test the consequences of our claims for learning from corpora of natural child-directed speech. This combination of experimental and computational studies will advance scientific knowledge about how children learn their native languages, and guide the development of new, robust learning protocols that will be of use in automatic natural language processing. The proposed research will help us to understand how children learn the words and syntax of their native languages; such research will contribute to the detection and remediation of language delays, and to language pedagogy. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research will examine verb learning and the development of sentence comprehension, using a combination of experiments with toddlers and preschoolers, and a computational model of early sentence comprehension. Our findings should have considerable impact, for two main reasons: First, our work will shed light on how learners begin to find meaning in syntax, addressing long-standing and fundamental scientific questions about language development. Second, the findings should help us predict and understand the consequences of individual variations in the early language environment for language development: by studying how young children collect and use linguistic-distributional data about words, we can predict what kinds of data they need to make typical progress, and thus what kinds of early experiences might lead to risks for language difficulties.",Verb learning and the early development of sentence comprehension,9040977,R01HD054448,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Behavior', 'Child', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Language', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ocular Fixation', 'Participant', 'Play', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Semantics', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Toddler', 'Uncertainty', 'Variant', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'combinatorial', 'computer studies', 'early experience', 'expectation', 'experience', 'improved', 'lexical', 'novel', 'pedagogy', 'remediation', 'research study', 'scale up', 'syntax', 'theories', 'word learning']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R01,2016,305943,-0.012583958327156744
"Novel Accelerometer Calibration and Validation in Children andAdolescents Summary Accelerometers have been embraced by the scientific community as valid and reliable physical activity (PA) assessment tools. This is especially true in some sub-populations, such as children, who lack the ability to self- report their behaviors. Tremendous progress has been made in the objective assessment of PA and sedentary behavior (SB). Several measurement challenges remain that limit our ability to identify; dose-response associations with disease and risk factors, prevalence and determinants of these important health behaviors, changes in behavior due to time and intervention efforts. To overcome these challenges, we propose novel calibration procedures that will leverage the richness of three axes of raw acceleration data during free-living calibration activities, from wrist- and hip-worn accelerometers. Consistent with current PA recommendations for youth, the proposed study will focus on calibrating and validating accelerometer output to quantify intensity and duration of PA and identifying specific predominant modes of activity (e.g., sedentary time, locomotion, and fine/gross motor activity). Our primary goal is to follow best-practices data collection and analysis procedures to develop a comprehensive set of accelerometer algorithms that will accurately and precisely estimate minutes of various intensities of PA and mode of activity from hip- and wrist-worn accelerometers in children and adolescents (18 months to 21 years old), using video recorded direct observation during free-living activities as the criterion measure. Narrative Accurate and precise estimates of physical activity, sedentary behavior, and patterns of those behaviors in youth are essential in order to identify changes in those behaviors and to inform related policy decisions. The proposed research will extend previous accelerometer calibration studies by videotaping free-living activities in a large sample across a wide age range of children and adolescents. The raw acceleration signals from both hip- and wrist-worn devices will be analyzed using linear regression and machine learning methods to generate a family of freely available algorithms that produce accurate and precise estimates, reducing inconsistencies and confusion on use of previous accelerometer cutpoints in youth.",Novel Accelerometer Calibration and Validation in Children andAdolescents,9157753,R01DK110148,"['21 year old', 'Acceleration', 'Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavior', 'Calibration', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Confusion', 'Controlled Environment', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Family', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Health behavior change', 'Hip region structure', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Life', 'Linear Regressions', 'Locomotion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Output', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Video Recording', 'Videotape', 'Wrist', 'Youth', 'age group', 'base', 'behavior change', 'cohort', 'computerized data processing', 'disorder risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'response', 'sedentary', 'sedentary activity', 'sedentary lifestyle']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST,R01,2016,400434,0.06274023999338837
"A Computational Biomechanical Airway Model for Obese Children at Risk for OSAS ABSTRACT Childhood obesity remains epidemic and is most prevalent in minorities. Obese children have a higher risk for developing obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) with an estimated prevalence of 50%, compared to the general pediatric population with a known prevalence of 2-4%. OSAS carries with it significant neurocognitive, cardiovascular, and metabolic derangements. Additionally, obese children do not respond well to treatment such as adenotonsillectomy or weight loss with residual OSAS exceeding 50%. Despite progress that has been made in recent years to understand the anatomical and functional attributes of OSAS in children, the precise mechanism leading to the disorder remains unknown in the majority of obese children, hindering the development of efficacious treatments. Thus, the overarching goal of this study is to implement state-of-the-art dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and image analytics using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and biomechanical modeling, to establish the biomechanical basis that leads to OSAS or protects from it, in naïve and treated children with obesity. NARRATIVE Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is a common and difficult to treat disorder in obese children and leads to significant medical consequences. We still do not understand why some obese children suffer from this disorder while other do not. The current study will use advance imaging analytical tools combined with biomechanical models to better understand the causes of the disorder and ways to improve outcomes of treatment in these children.",A Computational Biomechanical Airway Model for Obese Children at Risk for OSAS,9176080,R01HL130468,"['17 year old', 'Adenoidal structure', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Biomechanics', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Breathing', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Continuous Positive Airway Pressure', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dilator', 'Disease', 'Drops', 'Epidemic', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intercept', 'Intervention', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Muscle', 'Nasopharynx', 'Neurocognitive', 'Obesity', 'Object Attachment', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Oropharyngeal', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Property', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Sleep', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tonsil', 'analytical tool', 'awake', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'longitudinal design', 'novel', 'obesity in children', 'pharyngeal critical pressure', 'pressure', 'respiratory', 'response', 'standard care', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,"ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, INC",R01,2016,788036,0.09895461521146323
"A preschool biomarker for literacy DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As many as one in ten children have the poor reading and spelling skills that comprise developmental dyslexia. It is widely accepted that there is a neurological basis; however, the nature of that basis is hotly debated. Nevertheless, one consistent view is that poor phonological processing-the ability to access and manipulate the sound units of language-is involved in dyslexia. Indeed, a majority of children with reading deficits exhibit difficulties on an array of phonological processing tasks. A growing body of research has discovered that speech-sound transcription, as measured by electrophysiology, shows striking relationships with phonological processing skills and reading ability in school-age children. As such, we have developed a suite of subcortical and cortical physiological tests that probe some of the core deficits that researchers have postulated as the root elements of poor phonological processing. We will target the subcortical processing of time-varying signals and stimulus regularities, and cortical hemispheric specialization to both fast and slow signals. In a longitudinal cohort of four- to eight-year-olds, we will model the normal neurological speech transcription process, quantify its development, and examine its relationship with the development of literacy-related skills. Our intention is that by leveraging these electrophysiological probes to a pre-reading age group, a biomarker, in preschoolers, may be found that predicts a child's eventual reading skill as he/she progresses through the primary grades. If such a biomarker is found, it would pave the way for earlier and more effectively targeted intervention. As objective neurophysiological measures of literacy become available, a logical step is to apply what has been learned about subcortical and cortical physiology and their relationships with reading to young pre- readers. The outcome of the proposed work will be a deeper understanding of the biological underpinnings of literacy, particularly in pre-literate children, and a means to exploit objective biological responses as biomarkers of future literacy. This outcome will positively impact our understanding of the core deficits leading to poor reading, and has the potential to spur early intervention programs to head off the potential onset of developmental dyslexia.",A preschool biomarker for literacy,9032506,R01HD069414,"['4 year old', '8 year old', 'Acoustics', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Auditory Brainstem Responses', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain Stem', 'Cerebral Dominance', 'Child', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental reading disorder', 'Disease', 'Dyslexia', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Employee Strikes', 'Exhibits', 'Failure', 'Financial cost', 'Future', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Intention', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurologic', 'Nursery Schools', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Physiological Processes', 'Physiology', 'Plant Roots', 'Primary Schools', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Reading Disorder', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scalp structure', 'School-Age Population', 'Schools', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Speech Sound', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Synapses', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transcription Process', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'age group', 'auditory pathway', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive skill', 'cohort', 'contextual factors', 'corticofugal fiber', 'experience', 'falls', 'intervention program', 'literacy', 'literate', 'neurophysiology', 'peer', 'phonology', 'reading ability', 'reading difficulties', 'relating to nervous system', 'remediation', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'sound', 'spelling', 'stimulus processing']",NICHD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,373707,0.02616712468704533
"The relationship of fecal microbiomes and nutritional status in CF ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intestinal tract disease is responsible for a substantial amount of the morbidity and mortality among people with the genetic disease cystic fibrosis (CF). The manifestations of CF intestinal disease frequently occur during infancy and result from pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (PI), resulting in profound nutrient malabsorption and malnutrition, and consequently in growth failure and intestinal obstruction. Despite aggressive, early nutritional intervention with pancreatic enzyme replacement and other therapies, early growth failure remains common among infants with CF, suggesting that characteristics other than PI contribute to growth and nutritional failure in infants with CF. The identification of thes growth and nutritional determinants in children with CF therefore remains a key research goal in CF care. Recently, a clue to a potentially critical contributor to nutrient and energy uptake in children has emerged from the study of the microbes present in the gastrointestinal tract- the gut microbiota. Research has identified a complex relationship between gut microbiota, nutritional intake, nutrient absorption, and other health measures. GI tract microbes are known to contribute significantly to human nutrient metabolism and energy harvest, and they are altered in many disease states. Therefore, infant GI tract microbes may represent important determinants of CF nutritional outcomes, which in turn can significantly impact severity of lung disease and overall longevity. We recently showed that infants and children with CF had GI microbiota that differ markedly from those of children without CF, and that this dysbiosis correlated with severity of GI dysfunction. However, the relationships between CF GI microbiota with growth and other clinically important outcomes have not been studied. We hypothesize that the intestinal microbiomes among children with CF correlate with severity of malabsorption, intestinal inflammation, gastrointestinal signs and symptoms, vitamin and mineral deficiency, and nutritional status. To test these hypotheses, this ancillary study will define the fecal microbiomes of 250 infants with CF being enrolled in an ongoing multicenter study of infant nutrition (the Baby Observational NUtrition Study (BONUS), funded by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and the National Institutes of Health) using ultra high-throughput, culture-independent sequencing methods. With these resources, we will (1) define the fecal microbiomes, composed of the microbiota (the species of microbes present) and metagenomes (the microbial genes present, which reflects the metabolic capacity of the microbiota) of at least four stool samples per subject over the first year of life, and (2) determine the relationship of fecal microbiomes, and their evolution over the year of study, with nutritional and clinical parameters (including weight, height, body mass index, growth rate of each of these parameters among subjects, serum vitamin levels, fecal nutrient and metabolite content, GI symptoms, and measures of inflammation). We will use massively parallel next- generation DNA sequencing methods, combined with advanced bioinformatic analytical methods, with which we have extensive experience. Our goal is to define the role of the infant CF GI microbiome in growth and nutrition, with the hope of identifying interventions that will improve early growth, and thus long-term outcomes, in CF. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent scientific evidence suggests that the microbes that live in the gastrointestinal tracts of humans and other animals play key roles in the metabolism of nutrients, harvest of energy for the host, and the uptake of vitamins. Therefore, these microbes may be important contributors to diseases in which nutrients are poorly absorbed, the gastrointestinal tract is diseased, and/or the host grows poorly. The aim of this project is to determine the role of gastrointestinal microbes in the relentless and difficult-to-treat growth failure in children with the genetic disease cystic fibrosis, with the hope of both identifying interventions that will lead to better nutritional outcomes in these and in other children with poo early growth.",The relationship of fecal microbiomes and nutritional status in CF,9134726,R01DK095869,"['Address', 'Ancillary Study', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Genes', 'Bacteroides', 'Bioinformatics', 'Body mass index', 'Breast Feeding', 'Carbohydrates', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Dietary intake', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Enrollment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evolution', 'Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency', 'Failure', 'Fat-Soluble Vitamin', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Feces', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Harvest', 'Health', 'Height', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Infant', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Intestinal Diseases', 'Intestinal Obstruction', 'Intestines', 'Lead', 'Leukocyte L1 Antigen Complex', 'Life', 'Life Expectancy', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Longevity', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malabsorption Syndromes', 'Malnutrition', 'Massive Parallel Sequencing', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Micronutrients', 'Minerals', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Neonatal Screening', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional', 'Nutritional Study', 'Nutritional status', 'Observational Study', 'Obstruction', 'Outcome', 'Pancreatic enzyme', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteobacteria', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Specimen', 'Study models', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Vitamins', 'Volatile Fatty Acids', 'Weight', 'absorption', 'analytical method', 'aqueous', 'candidate marker', 'children with cystic fibrosis', 'design', 'dosage', 'early cystic fibrosis', 'enzyme replacement therapy', 'experience', 'gastrointestinal', 'gastrointestinal sign', 'gastrointestinal symptom', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'improved', 'infancy', 'infant nutrition', 'meetings', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'mortality', 'next generation', 'novel', 'nutrient absorption', 'nutrient metabolism', 'nutrition', 'routine care', 'uptake']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2016,653525,0.0700545120731259
"SCH: GEAR - Grounded Early Adaptive Rehabilitation ﻿PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions}: According to the 2010 US census (http://www.census.gov/prod/2011 pubs/acsbr1 0-12. pdf) 2.8 million school-aged children (aged 5 to 17) suffer from some form of mental and/or physical disability. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) guarantees such children equal access to education. However, children aged 1 to 5, while even more in need of early rehabilitation therapy and social interaction, do not receive the same attention. This proposal describes a plan for developing a new paradigm for pediatric rehabilitation. The paradigm involves robots that interact socially with special needs children, within a closed feedback control loop. Its components include new methods for modeling and representation of children motion, visual activity recognition, machine learning and behavior adaptation, and general-sum game-theoretic analysis of human-robot interaction. The research groups in the two collaborating institutions, University of Delaware (UD) and Johns Hopkins University (JHU), have produced preliminary results and evidence which suggest that the envisioned technical innovations in the domains mentioned above are feasible, and that physical implementation is possible.  There are three intertwined research thrusts in the proposed activity, that address specific long-standing challenges in each area: 1. pediatric rehabilitation: develop a robot-assisted, pediatric rehabilitation environment which combines motor training with social interaction; 2. computer vision and perception: develop interpretable perception and machine learning algorithms for adaptive activity recognition; 3. robot control: develop the control and coordination algorithms to enable directed and purposeful human-robot interaction. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Each year, 10 000 infants in the U.S. develop cerebral palsy and 4 000 infants have birth defects of the spine and the brain. The motor delays for these infants have lifelong consequences. This gap in mobility is a significant secondary impairment. We propose a new portable motor rehabilitation system with social robotic interfaces that maximizes rehabilitation dosage. The project will provide insights into motor development in special needs children suggesting a new early intervention paradigm for children with motor disabilities.",SCH: GEAR - Grounded Early Adaptive Rehabilitation,9067563,R01HD087133,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Body part', 'Brain', 'Censuses', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Dancing', 'Data', 'Delaware', 'Development', 'Disabled Persons', 'Early Intervention', 'Education', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Equipment', 'Feedback', 'Friends', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Human Activities', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Institution', 'Instruction', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Patients', 'Peer Group', 'Perception', 'Physical activity', 'Physically Handicapped', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'School-Age Population', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Socialization', 'Solutions', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Transducers', 'Universities', 'Vertebral column', 'Visual', 'Visual Motion', 'Weight', 'aged', 'base', 'catalyst', 'cognitive disability', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'disability', 'dosage', 'innovation', 'insight', 'instructor', 'learned behavior', 'meetings', 'neuromuscular', 'peer', 'personalized medicine', 'robot assistance', 'skeletal', 'social']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE,R01,2015,503237,0.07858704806871286
"PREDICTING OUTCOME IN CHILDREN WITH NEW-ONSET TICS USING NEUROIMAGING DATA ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Childhood onset neuropsychiatric disorders are often debilitating and are increasing in prevalence. Tourette Syndrome/Chronic Tic Disorder (TS/CTD), we propose, has a course that lends itself especially well to discovering optimal strategies for early diagnosis and prevention of developmental disorders. Common clinical practice and epidemiological data suggest that a large fraction (10-25%) of all children manifest motor and/or vocal tics at some age. Yet only 1-3% of all children have tics for the full year required for diagnosis of TS/CTD. The objective of the proposed research is to understand the structural and functional neuroimaging features of children with new-onset tics (""New Tics""), as the neurobiology of this population has not been investigated. Studying children with New Tics should provide the most leverage in understanding why tics remit in some children but not others. This proposal compares neuroimaging features of New Tics to TS/CTD and to controls, implements machine-learning tools to predict whether children with New Tics will remit or develop TS/CTD, and utilizes longitudinal scans to identify within-subject changes that occur as tics remit or persist.  The proposed study will apply resting-state functional connectivity MRI (rs fcMRI) and structural MRI methods to investigate children with New Tics. Neuroimaging will be conducted on children with current, new- onset tics, and comparisons will be made to existing MRI data from children with diagnosed TS/CTD and controls. Follow-up evaluation (1 year after tic onset) of New Tics will allow us to identify which children's tics remitted completely and whic were actually in the earliest stages of TS/CTD, thus sorting this group into Remitted Tics and Converted TS/CTD subgroups. Based on the epidemiological data, we expect most of New Tics subjects to fall in the Remitted Tics subgroup. Longitudinal scans of the New Tics children will enable us to assess within-subject changes that occur with remittance or persistence of tics. This study will also apply machine learning tools, specifically Support Vector Machines (SVMs), to characterize features that distinguish Remitted Tics and Existing TS/CTD groups. Those features will then be used to predict whether tics in the New Tics group will remit (Remitted Tics) or persist (Converted TS/CTD) on an individual patient basis. Thus, we will be poised to identify differences, and potentially early predictors, of remittance and TS/CTD.  This study will provide innovative, important data on a common clinical presentation: the child with New Tics. Completing our aims successfully will allow individual prediction of remission or progression, or at least will allow a New Tics sample to be enriched for high risk of developing TS/CTD, which would make prevention studies for TS/CTD feasible. We will also gain insight into the neurobiology of New Tics. Finally, this study is an essential first step towards a definitive longitudinal study that can improve diagnostic accuracy and settle questions of cause and effect. With successful completion of our aims, similar methods can be applied to other childhood onset neuropsychiatric disorders, setting the stage for early treatment or prevention of chronicity.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Roughly 1 out of 5 school age children will develop tics, i.e. repetitive, purposeless movements or noises. However, only about 3% of all children have a chronic tic disorder, such as Tourette syndrome (TS), so tics are transient (lasting less than 1 year) in most children with tics. Tics can cause significant morbidity and adversely affect quality of life. It is of great clinical and scientific interest to be able to predict which child with newonset of tics will go on to have morbidity from chronic tics, and understanding of the neurobiology of transient tics has an excellent chance of improving our ability to manage these patients and perhaps even prevent development of TS. More generally, this approach may give insights into how to approach other neurodevelopmental disorders such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or autism.                ",PREDICTING OUTCOME IN CHILDREN WITH NEW-ONSET TICS USING NEUROIMAGING DATA,8870047,R21NS091635,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain region', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Opinion', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Relative (related person)', 'Remittance', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'School-Age Population', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Staging', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Tic disorder', 'Transient Tics', 'Vocal Tics', 'Weight', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disorder control', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'tool', 'unpublished works']",NINDS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2015,228750,0.1150192887200291
"PREDICTING CHILDHOOD OUTCOMES IN PRETERM INFANTS USING CEREBRAL CONNECTIVITY DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Premature birth remains a major public health issue due to its continuing high incidence combined with the frequency of developmental impairments among surviving infants. In order to improve developmental outcomes in very preterm infants (VPT, born prior to 32 weeks' gestation), accurate and early identification of the alterations in brain development that lead to subsequent developmental impairment is required. The candidate for this K02 Independent Scientist Award is a uniquely trained pediatric neurologist who seeks to define the relationship between cerebral connectivity during infancy and childhood developmental outcomes. This project will involve a valuable, well-characterized VPT cohort (N=128) which includes high-risk children selected due to the presence of brain injury during the neonatal period. These children have undergone clinical characterization and MRI during the neonatal period and developmental assessment at age 2 years. They will now undergo standardized assessment of developmental outcomes at age 5 years. The central hypotheses are that VPT children will display a persisting range of motor and language difficulties, and that affected VPT children will display abnormalities on imaging measures obtained during infancy that predict childhood performance, both at the group and individual level, in these distinct and critical developmental domains. We propose to investigate these postulates by: 1) comprehensively evaluating childhood motor and language performance; 2) defining the relationship between alterations in domain-specific neonatal functional and structural connectivity and childhood motor and language outcomes; and 3) investigating differences in brain- wide cerebral connectivity in impaired VPT children using machine learning, pattern classification approach. The result will be characterization of the alterations in cerebral connectivity that underlie developmental disabilities in VPT children. In addition, we seek to develop highly valuable neuroimaging biomarkers that predict future motor and language impairment, enabling the provision of targeted care tailored to the needs of each individual infant. Finally, these tools will contribute to future, large-scale trials evaluating interventions designed to protect the developing brain. In pursuit of this goal, a focused career development program will complement the candidate's background in engineering and magnetic resonance methodology with training in developmental assessments and innovative image analysis approaches using applied mathematics, providing skills necessary to perform accurate longitudinal clinical research studies and develop individual prediction models. The supported activities will facilitate an NIH R-mechanism application centered upon innovative investigation of individual prediction models for developmental trajectories in VPT children during school-age, including repeat neuroimaging assessments during childhood. The culmination of these efforts will be transformative investigation that fosters improved outcomes for this high-risk population. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Despite continued high rates of disabilities in infants born prematurely, methods for accurately identifying those that would benefit most from specific therapies or protective interventions remain limited. This study is designed to improve our understanding of the alterations in brain function and structure that produce these deficits by using novel approaches to examine how magnetic resonance imaging data predicts early childhood outcomes. The goal is to identify imaging measures which identify preterm infants at risk for particular deficits, thereby allowing institution of timely therapies specific to each chid's needs and enabling larger research trials evaluating interventions designed to improve developmental outcomes in this vulnerable group.",PREDICTING CHILDHOOD OUTCOMES IN PRETERM INFANTS USING CEREBRAL CONNECTIVITY,8934210,K02NS089852,"['2 year old', '5 year old', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Caring', 'Cerebrum', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Disabilities', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Early identification', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Independent Scientist Award', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Institution', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Language Disorders', 'Lead', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Nature', 'Neonatal', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurologist', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'School-Age Population', 'Structure', 'Survival Rate', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'career development', 'cohort', 'design', 'disability', 'early childhood', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'motor deficit', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prospective', 'research study', 'skills', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'white matter injury']",NINDS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K02,2015,191131,0.031835498577100094
"Verb learning and the early development of sentence comprehension DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Children use syntax to understand sentences and to learn verbs; this is syntactic bootstrapping. We proposed a Structure Mapping account of the origins of syntactic bootstrapping. On this account, children begin with an unlearned bias toward one-to-one mapping between nouns in sentences and participant-roles in events. Given this bias, children find the number of nouns in a sentence inherently meaningful. In the previous funding period, we tested key predictions of this account, and found strong evidence for structure-mapping. Identifying the set of nouns in sentences yields a partial representation of syntactic structure that allows toddlers to identify verbs, and to interpret novel transitive and intransitive verbs in simple sentences. The proposed research asks how syntactic bootstrapping moves beyond 'counting the nouns', scaling up to the true complexity of verbs and sentences. We focus on two data-sources: distributional learning and discourse structure. First, we propose that distributional learning creates probabilistic syntactic-semantic combinatorial knowledge about verbs. This combinatorial knowledge, also known as verb bias, permits syntactic bootstrapping, and from early in development is used online to help identify the structure and lexical content of sentences, guiding syntactic analysis. Second, we propose that a bias toward discourse continuity increases linguistic support for verb learning by allowing learners to collect evidence for arguments across nearby sentences. Verb bias guides this process, by cuing children to seek referents for missing arguments in the discourse context. To investigate these proposals we combine experiments with toddlers and preschoolers, and a computational model based on systems for automatic semantic role labeling. Experiments with children assess comprehension of familiar and invented verbs in sentences, by measuring children's visual fixations to relevant scenes or objects. Project 1 explores toddlers' encoding of syntactic-semantic combinatorial facts about verbs from listening experience. Project 2 explores toddlers' use of discourse context to guide sentence interpretation, constrained by verb bias. Project 3 asks to what extent verb bias in preschoolers changes with new distributional learning. In Project 4 we develop our computational model to investigate the same processes. Results from experiments with children constrain the features we equip the model to detect; we use the model to test the consequences of our claims for learning from corpora of natural child-directed speech. This combination of experimental and computational studies will advance scientific knowledge about how children learn their native languages, and guide the development of new, robust learning protocols that will be of use in automatic natural language processing. The proposed research will help us to understand how children learn the words and syntax of their native languages; such research will contribute to the detection and remediation of language delays, and to language pedagogy. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research will examine verb learning and the development of sentence comprehension, using a combination of experiments with toddlers and preschoolers, and a computational model of early sentence comprehension. Our findings should have considerable impact, for two main reasons: First, our work will shed light on how learners begin to find meaning in syntax, addressing long-standing and fundamental scientific questions about language development. Second, the findings should help us predict and understand the consequences of individual variations in the early language environment for language development: by studying how young children collect and use linguistic-distributional data about words, we can predict what kinds of data they need to make typical progress, and thus what kinds of early experiences might lead to risks for language difficulties.",Verb learning and the early development of sentence comprehension,8837036,R01HD054448,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Behavior', 'Child', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Language', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ocular Fixation', 'Participant', 'Play', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Semantics', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Toddler', 'Uncertainty', 'Variant', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'combinatorial', 'computer studies', 'early experience', 'expectation', 'experience', 'improved', 'lexical', 'novel', 'remediation', 'research study', 'scale up', 'syntax', 'theories', 'word learning']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R01,2015,301821,-0.012583958327156744
"In utero antidepressant exposures and risk for autism DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In utero exposure to antidepressants was recently associated with increased risk for autism in an analysis of a large health care claims database. This result is consistent with twin studies indicating greater concordance for autism among dizygotic twins compared to non-twin siblings, likely pointing to shared in utero risk. The need to clarify the risk posed by antidepressants is acute, as it has profound public health implications. Confirmation of the finding would support a rare modifiable risk factor for autism, and help to elucidate the underlying pathophysiology of the disorder. Conversely, if the finding is a false positive, it might lead to undertreatment of major depression among pregnant women, with consequent risks to both mother and fetus. The proposed study will utilize electronic medical record (EMR) data from more than 4 million individuals in a large New England health system. The investigators and their colleagues have previously applied an EMR query toolkit, which they helped to develop, to characterize treatment outcomes and conduct pharmacovigilance and genetic studies in psychiatry and beyond. Notably, this health care system includes large obstetrics, psychiatry, and pediatric practices, and is a referral center for child neuropsychiatri disorders. Children ages 4-12 with a diagnosis of autism who were delivered in this system will be identified using validated natural language processing tools. A matched (2:1) cohort of children with a diagnosis of ADHD will be identified, along with a matched (5:1) control cohort of children receiving routine pediatric care. The EMR will then be used to match each child with their mother, allowing characterization of maternal socio-demographic status, medical and psychiatric illness, and medication treatment during pregnancy. To further improve precision, Massachusetts state birth certificate data will be queried. This data includes details of perinatal care, exposures, and complications, as well as paternal age and socio-demographic status. Regression models will be applied to the resulting data set, encompassing more than 700 children with autism, 1400 children with ADHD, and 3500 healthy control children. In addition to examining the association between antidepressant exposure and autism liability, with appropriate control for confounding, this data set will allow investigation of other putative in utero and perinatal risk factors, creating a key resource for future studies. This project will innovate in two key respects. First, it will address the problem of confounding by indication present in prior antidepressant pharmacovigilance studies, using tools developed by the investigators for characterizing depression severity/comorbidity and course to better match cases and controls. Second, it will establish the utility of an EMR-based approach for studying pregnancy exposures and outcomes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will estimate the amount of autism risk, if any, associated with exposure to antidepressants and other medicines before birth. This information will allow mothers to make more informed decisions weighing the risks and benefits of treatment for depression and related illnesses during pregnancy. It may also contribute to a better understanding of the causes of autism itself.",In utero antidepressant exposures and risk for autism,8829343,R01MH100286,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Age', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Anxiety', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavioral', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Birth', 'Birth Certificates', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Comorbidity', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Dizygotic Twins', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Fetus', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genetic Load', 'Genetic study', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Insurance Claim Review', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Massachusetts', 'Maternal Exposure', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'New England', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Paternal Age', 'Perinatal', 'Perinatal Care', 'Perinatal Exposure', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor', 'Severities', 'Siblings', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment outcome', 'Twin Studies', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'case control', 'clinical application', 'cohort', 'data mining', 'depressive symptoms', 'improved', 'in utero', 'innovation', 'interest', 'maternal depression', 'modifiable risk', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'prenatal risk factor', 'randomized trial', 'sample collection', 'tool']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2015,348000,0.014744478336495389
"Neurobehavioral Contributors to Math Failure: A Reward-Based Learning Framework DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this set of applications, we propose to initiate a new Learning Disabilities Research Hub focusing initially on high risk for mathematics failure. We proposed to situate this new Hub within an existing strong infrastructure for pediatric neurobehavioral and imaging research, the Pediatric Neurocognition, Imaging, and Genetics (PING) data resource. PING infrastructure provides many important advantages for building a new cross disciplinary and multiple-investigator program, as it has already brought together a strong team of behavioral, clinical, imaging, computational, and genetics investigators as a closely integrated team, and most importantly has attracted a very talented group of young investigators and graduate students focused on the problems addressed in the proposed research. A unifying theme of the studies that our team has proposed is the notion that math failure, and perhaps academic failure more broadly, emerges gradually through interactions of putative early conceptual weaknesses, attributable in some cases to poor functioning and anomalous neural architecture in specific neural systems, with increasing reward-based biases that contribute, additively or non-additively, to suppression of the normal learning trajectory. Consistent with this theme we refer to our proposed research hub as the Roles of Emotion and Choice (REaCh) in Learning Disabilities Research Hub (LDRH). The proposed REaCh Hub has 3 components: a new research project to investigate key questions about learning and the neural architecture during early development in children at high risk for math failure, and two cores. The Administrative Core proposal describes the management plan for the new Hub and the PING infrastructure that will be adapted for the new studies; and focuses on a nested mentoring plan for ensuring close interaction between trainees at different levels with mid-level and senior investigators within focused workgroups. The assets of the Core for within-Hub and extra-Hub data sharing are also described. A Developmental Infrastructure Core proposal describes the administration of a small grant program to support novel work within the Hub by junior investigators, trainees, and investigators from disciplines outside of the original REaCh LDRH group. A new Learning Disabilities Research Hub would be created to bring scientists with different kinds of expertise together to study learning disabilities, focusing initially on risk for math failure in young children. The scientists would study learning and brain development in children and focus specifically on the importance of the children's emotional responses to mathematical information.",Neurobehavioral Contributors to Math Failure: A Reward-Based Learning Framework,8885862,R24HD075489,"['12 year old', 'Accounting', 'Achievement', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Animals', 'Anisotropy', 'Anxiety', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Association Learning', 'Attention', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Choice Behavior', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Ensure', 'Exposure to', 'Failure', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurocognition', 'Neurocognitive', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pediatric Research', 'Perception', 'Perceptual learning', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'School-Age Population', 'Scientist', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stimulus', 'Surface', 'System', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'classical conditioning', 'computational neuroscience', 'data sharing', 'elementary school', 'emotional factor', 'experience', 'genome-wide', 'graduate student', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'intraparietal sulcus', 'mathematical ability', 'mathematical learning', 'mathematical model', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'preference', 'programs', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'reward processing', 'skills']",NICHD,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R24,2015,547017,0.053036561022965056
"A preschool biomarker for literacy DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As many as one in ten children have the poor reading and spelling skills that comprise developmental dyslexia. It is widely accepted that there is a neurological basis; however, the nature of that basis is hotly debated. Nevertheless, one consistent view is that poor phonological processing-the ability to access and manipulate the sound units of language-is involved in dyslexia. Indeed, a majority of children with reading deficits exhibit difficulties on an array of phonological processing tasks. A growing body of research has discovered that speech-sound transcription, as measured by electrophysiology, shows striking relationships with phonological processing skills and reading ability in school-age children. As such, we have developed a suite of subcortical and cortical physiological tests that probe some of the core deficits that researchers have postulated as the root elements of poor phonological processing. We will target the subcortical processing of time-varying signals and stimulus regularities, and cortical hemispheric specialization to both fast and slow signals. In a longitudinal cohort of four- to eight-year-olds, we will model the normal neurological speech transcription process, quantify its development, and examine its relationship with the development of literacy-related skills. Our intention is that by leveraging these electrophysiological probes to a pre-reading age group, a biomarker, in preschoolers, may be found that predicts a child's eventual reading skill as he/she progresses through the primary grades. If such a biomarker is found, it would pave the way for earlier and more effectively targeted intervention. As objective neurophysiological measures of literacy become available, a logical step is to apply what has been learned about subcortical and cortical physiology and their relationships with reading to young pre- readers. The outcome of the proposed work will be a deeper understanding of the biological underpinnings of literacy, particularly in pre-literate children, and a means to exploit objective biological responses as biomarkers of future literacy. This outcome will positively impact our understanding of the core deficits leading to poor reading, and has the potential to spur early intervention programs to head off the potential onset of developmental dyslexia.",A preschool biomarker for literacy,8826794,R01HD069414,"['4 year old', '8 year old', 'Acoustics', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Auditory Brainstem Responses', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain Stem', 'Cerebral Dominance', 'Child', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental reading disorder', 'Disease', 'Dyslexia', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Employee Strikes', 'Exhibits', 'Failure', 'Financial cost', 'Future', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Intention', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurologic', 'Nursery Schools', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Physiological Processes', 'Physiology', 'Plant Roots', 'Primary Schools', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Reading Disorder', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scalp structure', 'School-Age Population', 'Schools', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Speech Sound', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Synapses', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transcription Process', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'age group', 'auditory pathway', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive skill', 'cohort', 'contextual factors', 'corticofugal fiber', 'experience', 'falls', 'intervention program', 'literacy', 'literate', 'neurophysiology', 'peer', 'phonology', 'reading ability', 'reading difficulties', 'relating to nervous system', 'remediation', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'sound', 'spelling', 'stimulus processing']",NICHD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,356936,0.02616712468704533
"The relationship of fecal microbiomes and nutritional status in CF ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intestinal tract disease is responsible for a substantial amount of the morbidity and mortality among people with the genetic disease cystic fibrosis (CF). The manifestations of CF intestinal disease frequently occur during infancy and result from pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (PI), resulting in profound nutrient malabsorption and malnutrition, and consequently in growth failure and intestinal obstruction. Despite aggressive, early nutritional intervention with pancreatic enzyme replacement and other therapies, early growth failure remains common among infants with CF, suggesting that characteristics other than PI contribute to growth and nutritional failure in infants with CF. The identification of thes growth and nutritional determinants in children with CF therefore remains a key research goal in CF care. Recently, a clue to a potentially critical contributor to nutrient and energy uptake in children has emerged from the study of the microbes present in the gastrointestinal tract- the gut microbiota. Research has identified a complex relationship between gut microbiota, nutritional intake, nutrient absorption, and other health measures. GI tract microbes are known to contribute significantly to human nutrient metabolism and energy harvest, and they are altered in many disease states. Therefore, infant GI tract microbes may represent important determinants of CF nutritional outcomes, which in turn can significantly impact severity of lung disease and overall longevity. We recently showed that infants and children with CF had GI microbiota that differ markedly from those of children without CF, and that this dysbiosis correlated with severity of GI dysfunction. However, the relationships between CF GI microbiota with growth and other clinically important outcomes have not been studied. We hypothesize that the intestinal microbiomes among children with CF correlate with severity of malabsorption, intestinal inflammation, gastrointestinal signs and symptoms, vitamin and mineral deficiency, and nutritional status. To test these hypotheses, this ancillary study will define the fecal microbiomes of 250 infants with CF being enrolled in an ongoing multicenter study of infant nutrition (the Baby Observational NUtrition Study (BONUS), funded by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and the National Institutes of Health) using ultra high-throughput, culture-independent sequencing methods. With these resources, we will (1) define the fecal microbiomes, composed of the microbiota (the species of microbes present) and metagenomes (the microbial genes present, which reflects the metabolic capacity of the microbiota) of at least four stool samples per subject over the first year of life, and (2) determine the relationship of fecal microbiomes, and their evolution over the year of study, with nutritional and clinical parameters (including weight, height, body mass index, growth rate of each of these parameters among subjects, serum vitamin levels, fecal nutrient and metabolite content, GI symptoms, and measures of inflammation). We will use massively parallel next- generation DNA sequencing methods, combined with advanced bioinformatic analytical methods, with which we have extensive experience. Our goal is to define the role of the infant CF GI microbiome in growth and nutrition, with the hope of identifying interventions that will improve early growth, and thus long-term outcomes, in CF. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent scientific evidence suggests that the microbes that live in the gastrointestinal tracts of humans and other animals play key roles in the metabolism of nutrients, harvest of energy for the host, and the uptake of vitamins. Therefore, these microbes may be important contributors to diseases in which nutrients are poorly absorbed, the gastrointestinal tract is diseased, and/or the host grows poorly. The aim of this project is to determine the role of gastrointestinal microbes in the relentless and difficult-to-treat growth failure in children with the genetic disease cystic fibrosis, with the hope of both identifying interventions that will lead to better nutritional outcomes in these and in other children with poo early growth.",The relationship of fecal microbiomes and nutritional status in CF,8929222,R01DK095869,"['Address', 'Ancillary Study', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Genes', 'Bacteroides', 'Bioinformatics', 'Body mass index', 'Breast Feeding', 'Carbohydrates', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Dietary intake', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Enrollment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evolution', 'Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency', 'Failure', 'Fat-Soluble Vitamin', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Feces', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Harvest', 'Health', 'Height', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Infant', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Intestinal Diseases', 'Intestinal Obstruction', 'Intestines', 'Lead', 'Leukocyte L1 Antigen Complex', 'Life', 'Life Expectancy', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Longevity', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malabsorption Syndromes', 'Malnutrition', 'Massive Parallel Sequencing', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Micronutrients', 'Minerals', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Neonatal Screening', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional', 'Nutritional Study', 'Nutritional status', 'Observational Study', 'Obstruction', 'Outcome', 'Pancreatic enzyme', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteobacteria', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Specimen', 'Study models', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Vitamins', 'Volatile Fatty Acids', 'Weight', 'absorption', 'analytical method', 'aqueous', 'candidate marker', 'children with cystic fibrosis', 'design', 'dosage', 'early cystic fibrosis', 'enzyme replacement therapy', 'experience', 'gastrointestinal', 'gastrointestinal sign', 'gastrointestinal symptom', 'gut microbiota', 'improved', 'infancy', 'infant nutrition', 'meetings', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'mortality', 'next generation', 'novel', 'nutrient absorption', 'nutrient metabolism', 'nutrition', 'routine care', 'uptake']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2015,645802,0.0700545120731259
"PREDICTING CHILDHOOD OUTCOMES IN PRETERM INFANTS USING CEREBRAL CONNECTIVITY     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Premature birth remains a major public health issue due to its continuing high incidence combined with the frequency of developmental impairments among surviving infants. In order to improve developmental outcomes in very preterm infants (VPT, born prior to 32 weeks' gestation), accurate and early identification of the alterations in brain development that lead to subsequent developmental impairment is required. The candidate for this K02 Independent Scientist Award is a uniquely trained pediatric neurologist who seeks to define the relationship between cerebral connectivity during infancy and childhood developmental outcomes. This project will involve a valuable, well-characterized VPT cohort (N=128) which includes high-risk children selected due to the presence of brain injury during the neonatal period. These children have undergone clinical characterization and MRI during the neonatal period and developmental assessment at age 2 years. They will now undergo standardized assessment of developmental outcomes at age 5 years. The central hypotheses are that VPT children will display a persisting range of motor and language difficulties, and that affected VPT children will display abnormalities on imaging measures obtained during infancy that predict childhood performance, both at the group and individual level, in these distinct and critical developmental domains. We propose to investigate these postulates by: 1) comprehensively evaluating childhood motor and language performance; 2) defining the relationship between alterations in domain-specific neonatal functional and structural connectivity and childhood motor and language outcomes; and 3) investigating differences in brain- wide cerebral connectivity in impaired VPT children using machine learning, pattern classification approach. The result will be characterization of the alterations in cerebral connectivity that underlie developmental disabilities in VPT children. In addition, we seek to develop highly valuable neuroimaging biomarkers that predict future motor and language impairment, enabling the provision of targeted care tailored to the needs of each individual infant. Finally, these tools will contribute to future, large-scale trials evaluating interventions designed to protect the developing brain. In pursuit of this goal, a focused career development program will complement the candidate's background in engineering and magnetic resonance methodology with training in developmental assessments and innovative image analysis approaches using applied mathematics, providing skills necessary to perform accurate longitudinal clinical research studies and develop individual prediction models. The supported activities will facilitate an NIH R-mechanism application centered upon innovative investigation of individual prediction models for developmental trajectories in VPT children during school-age, including repeat neuroimaging assessments during childhood. The culmination of these efforts will be transformative investigation that fosters improved outcomes for this high-risk population.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Despite continued high rates of disabilities in infants born prematurely, methods for accurately identifying those that would benefit most from specific therapies or protective interventions remain limited. This study is designed to improve our understanding of the alterations in brain function and structure that produce these deficits by using novel approaches to examine how magnetic resonance imaging data predicts early childhood outcomes. The goal is to identify imaging measures which identify preterm infants at risk for particular deficits, thereby allowing institution of timely therapies specific to each chid's needs and enabling larger research trials evaluating interventions designed to improve developmental outcomes in this vulnerable group.                ",PREDICTING CHILDHOOD OUTCOMES IN PRETERM INFANTS USING CEREBRAL CONNECTIVITY,8804757,K02NS089852,"['2 year old', '5 year old', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Caring', 'Cerebrum', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Disabilities', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Early identification', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Independent Scientist Award', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Institution', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Language Disorders', 'Lead', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Nature', 'Neonatal', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurologist', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'School-Age Population', 'Structure', 'Survival Rate', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'career development', 'cohort', 'design', 'disability', 'early childhood', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'motor deficit', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'skills', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'white matter injury']",NINDS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K02,2014,191131,0.031835498577100094
"Verb learning and the early development of sentence comprehension     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Children use syntax to understand sentences and to learn verbs; this is syntactic bootstrapping. We proposed a Structure Mapping account of the origins of syntactic bootstrapping. On this account, children begin with an unlearned bias toward one-to-one mapping between nouns in sentences and participant-roles in events. Given this bias, children find the number of nouns in a sentence inherently meaningful. In the previous funding period, we tested key predictions of this account, and found strong evidence for structure-mapping. Identifying the set of nouns in sentences yields a partial representation of syntactic structure that allows toddlers to identify verbs, and to interpret novel transitive and intransitive verbs in simple sentences. The proposed research asks how syntactic bootstrapping moves beyond 'counting the nouns', scaling up to the true complexity of verbs and sentences. We focus on two data-sources: distributional learning and discourse structure. First, we propose that distributional learning creates probabilistic syntactic-semantic combinatorial knowledge about verbs. This combinatorial knowledge, also known as verb bias, permits syntactic bootstrapping, and from early in development is used online to help identify the structure and lexical content of sentences, guiding syntactic analysis. Second, we propose that a bias toward discourse continuity increases linguistic support for verb learning by allowing learners to collect evidence for arguments across nearby sentences. Verb bias guides this process, by cuing children to seek referents for missing arguments in the discourse context. To investigate these proposals we combine experiments with toddlers and preschoolers, and a computational model based on systems for automatic semantic role labeling. Experiments with children assess comprehension of familiar and invented verbs in sentences, by measuring children's visual fixations to relevant scenes or objects. Project 1 explores toddlers' encoding of syntactic-semantic combinatorial facts about verbs from listening experience. Project 2 explores toddlers' use of discourse context to guide sentence interpretation, constrained by verb bias. Project 3 asks to what extent verb bias in preschoolers changes with new distributional learning. In Project 4 we develop our computational model to investigate the same processes. Results from experiments with children constrain the features we equip the model to detect; we use the model to test the consequences of our claims for learning from corpora of natural child-directed speech. This combination of experimental and computational studies will advance scientific knowledge about how children learn their native languages, and guide the development of new, robust learning protocols that will be of use in automatic natural language processing. The proposed research will help us to understand how children learn the words and syntax of their native languages; such research will contribute to the detection and remediation of language delays, and to language pedagogy.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research will examine verb learning and the development of sentence comprehension, using a combination of experiments with toddlers and preschoolers, and a computational model of early sentence comprehension. Our findings should have considerable impact, for two main reasons: First, our work will shed light on how learners begin to find meaning in syntax, addressing long-standing and fundamental scientific questions about language development. Second, the findings should help us predict and understand the consequences of individual variations in the early language environment for language development: by studying how young children collect and use linguistic-distributional data about words, we can predict what kinds of data they need to make typical progress, and thus what kinds of early experiences might lead to risks for language difficulties.            ",Verb learning and the early development of sentence comprehension,8697336,R01HD054448,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Behavior', 'Child', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Language', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ocular Fixation', 'Participant', 'Play', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Semantics', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Toddler', 'Uncertainty', 'Variant', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'combinatorial', 'computer studies', 'early experience', 'expectation', 'experience', 'improved', 'lexical', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'remediation', 'research study', 'scale up', 'syntax', 'theories']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R01,2014,310072,-0.012583958327156744
"In utero antidepressant exposures and risk for autism     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In utero exposure to antidepressants was recently associated with increased risk for autism in an analysis of a large health care claims database. This result is consistent with twin studies indicating greater concordance for autism among dizygotic twins compared to non-twin siblings, likely pointing to shared in utero risk. The need to clarify the risk posed by antidepressants is acute, as it has profound public health implications. Confirmation of the finding would support a rare modifiable risk factor for autism, and help to elucidate the underlying pathophysiology of the disorder. Conversely, if the finding is a false positive, it might lead to undertreatment of major depression among pregnant women, with consequent risks to both mother and fetus. The proposed study will utilize electronic medical record (EMR) data from more than 4 million individuals in a large New England health system. The investigators and their colleagues have previously applied an EMR query toolkit, which they helped to develop, to characterize treatment outcomes and conduct pharmacovigilance and genetic studies in psychiatry and beyond. Notably, this health care system includes large obstetrics, psychiatry, and pediatric practices, and is a referral center for child neuropsychiatri disorders. Children ages 4-12 with a diagnosis of autism who were delivered in this system will be identified using validated natural language processing tools. A matched (2:1) cohort of children with a diagnosis of ADHD will be identified, along with a matched (5:1) control cohort of children receiving routine pediatric care. The EMR will then be used to match each child with their mother, allowing characterization of maternal socio-demographic status, medical and psychiatric illness, and medication treatment during pregnancy. To further improve precision, Massachusetts state birth certificate data will be queried. This data includes details of perinatal care, exposures, and complications, as well as paternal age and socio-demographic status. Regression models will be applied to the resulting data set, encompassing more than 700 children with autism, 1400 children with ADHD, and 3500 healthy control children. In addition to examining the association between antidepressant exposure and autism liability, with appropriate control for confounding, this data set will allow investigation of other putative in utero and perinatal risk factors, creating a key resource for future studies. This project will innovate in two key respects. First, it will address the problem of confounding by indication present in prior antidepressant pharmacovigilance studies, using tools developed by the investigators for characterizing depression severity/comorbidity and course to better match cases and controls. Second, it will establish the utility of an EMR-based approach for studying pregnancy exposures and outcomes.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will estimate the amount of autism risk, if any, associated with exposure to antidepressants and other medicines before birth. This information will allow mothers to make more informed decisions weighing the risks and benefits of treatment for depression and related illnesses during pregnancy. It may also contribute to a better understanding of the causes of autism itself.            ",In utero antidepressant exposures and risk for autism,8663964,R01MH100286,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Age', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Anxiety', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavioral', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Birth', 'Birth Certificates', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Comorbidity', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Dizygotic Twins', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Fetus', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Load', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Insurance Claim Review', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Massachusetts', 'Maternal Exposure', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'New England', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Paternal Age', 'Perinatal', 'Perinatal Care', 'Perinatal Exposure', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor', 'Severities', 'Siblings', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment outcome', 'Twin Studies', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'case control', 'clinical application', 'cohort', 'data mining', 'depressive symptoms', 'improved', 'in utero', 'innovation', 'interest', 'maternal depression', 'modifiable risk', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'prenatal risk factor', 'public health relevance', 'randomized trial', 'sample collection', 'tool']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2014,348000,0.014744478336495389
"Neurobehavioral Contributors to Math Failure: A Reward-Based Learning Framework DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this set of applications, we propose to initiate a new Learning Disabilities Research Hub focusing initially on high risk for mathematics failure. We proposed to situate this new Hub within an existing strong infrastructure for pediatric neurobehavioral and imaging research, the Pediatric Neurocognition, Imaging, and Genetics (PING) data resource. PING infrastructure provides many important advantages for building a new cross disciplinary and multiple-investigator program, as it has already brought together a strong team of behavioral, clinical, imaging, computational, and genetics investigators as a closely integrated team, and most importantly has attracted a very talented group of young investigators and graduate students focused on the problems addressed in the proposed research. A unifying theme of the studies that our team has proposed is the notion that math failure, and perhaps academic failure more broadly, emerges gradually through interactions of putative early conceptual weaknesses, attributable in some cases to poor functioning and anomalous neural architecture in specific neural systems, with increasing reward-based biases that contribute, additively or non-additively, to suppression of the normal learning trajectory. Consistent with this theme we refer to our proposed research hub as the Roles of Emotion and Choice (REaCh) in Learning Disabilities Research Hub (LDRH). The proposed REaCh Hub has 3 components: a new research project to investigate key questions about learning and the neural architecture during early development in children at high risk for math failure, and two cores. The Administrative Core proposal describes the management plan for the new Hub and the PING infrastructure that will be adapted for the new studies; and focuses on a nested mentoring plan for ensuring close interaction between trainees at different levels with mid-level and senior investigators within focused workgroups. The assets of the Core for within-Hub and extra-Hub data sharing are also described. A Developmental Infrastructure Core proposal describes the administration of a small grant program to support novel work within the Hub by junior investigators, trainees, and investigators from disciplines outside of the original REaCh LDRH group. A new Learning Disabilities Research Hub would be created to bring scientists with different kinds of expertise together to study learning disabilities, focusing initially on risk for math failure in young children.

"A preschool biomarker for literacy     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As many as one in ten children have the poor reading and spelling skills that comprise developmental dyslexia. It is widely accepted that there is a neurological basis; however, the nature of that basis is hotly debated. Nevertheless, one consistent view is that poor phonological processing-the ability to access and manipulate the sound units of language-is involved in dyslexia. Indeed, a majority of children with reading deficits exhibit difficulties on an array of phonological processing tasks. A growing body of research has discovered that speech-sound transcription, as measured by electrophysiology, shows striking relationships with phonological processing skills and reading ability in school-age children. As such, we have developed a suite of subcortical and cortical physiological tests that probe some of the core deficits that researchers have postulated as the root elements of poor phonological processing. We will target the subcortical processing of time-varying signals and stimulus regularities, and cortical hemispheric specialization to both fast and slow signals. In a longitudinal cohort of four- to eight-year-olds, we will model the normal neurological speech transcription process, quantify its development, and examine its relationship with the development of literacy-related skills. Our intention is that by leveraging these electrophysiological probes to a pre-reading age group, a biomarker, in preschoolers, may be found that predicts a child's eventual reading skill as he/she progresses through the primary grades. If such a biomarker is found, it would pave the way for earlier and more effectively targeted intervention.          As objective neurophysiological measures of literacy become available, a logical step is to apply what has been learned about subcortical and cortical physiology and their relationships with reading to young pre- readers. The outcome of the proposed work will be a deeper understanding of the biological underpinnings of literacy, particularly in pre-literate children, and a means to exploit objective biological responses as biomarkers of future literacy. This outcome will positively impact our understanding of the core deficits leading to poor reading, and has the potential to spur early intervention programs to head off the potential onset of developmental dyslexia.

"The relationship of fecal microbiomes and nutritional status in CF ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intestinal tract disease is responsible for a substantial amount of the morbidity and mortality among people with the genetic disease cystic fibrosis (CF). The manifestations of CF intestinal disease frequently occur during infancy and result from pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (PI), resulting in profound nutrient malabsorption and malnutrition, and consequently in growth failure and intestinal obstruction. Despite aggressive, early nutritional intervention with pancreatic enzyme replacement and other therapies, early growth failure remains common among infants with CF, suggesting that characteristics other than PI contribute to growth and nutritional failure in infants with CF. The identification of thes growth and nutritional determinants in children with CF therefore remains a key research goal in CF care. Recently, a clue to a potentially critical contributor to nutrient and energy uptake in children has emerged from the study of the microbes present in the gastrointestinal tract- the gut microbiota. Research has identified a complex relationship between gut microbiota, nutritional intake, nutrient absorption, and other health measures. GI tract microbes are known to contribute significantly to human nutrient metabolism and energy harvest, and they are altered in many disease states. Therefore, infant GI tract microbes may represent important determinants of CF nutritional outcomes, which in turn can significantly impact severity of lung disease and overall longevity. We recently showed that infants and children with CF had GI microbiota that differ markedly from those of children without CF, and that this dysbiosis correlated with severity of GI dysfunction. However, the relationships between CF GI microbiota with growth and other clinically important outcomes have not been studied. We hypothesize that the intestinal microbiomes among children with CF correlate with severity of malabsorption, intestinal inflammation, gastrointestinal signs and symptoms, vitamin and mineral deficiency, and nutritional status. To test these hypotheses, this ancillary study will define the fecal microbiomes of 250 infants with CF being enrolled in an ongoing multicenter study of infant nutrition (the Baby Observational NUtrition Study (BONUS), funded by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and the National Institutes of Health) using ultra high-throughput, culture-independent sequencing methods. With these resources, we will (1) define the fecal microbiomes, composed of the microbiota (the species of microbes present) and metagenomes (the microbial genes present, which reflects the metabolic capacity of the microbiota) of at least four stool samples per subject over the first year of life, and (2) determine the relationship of fecal microbiomes, and their evolution over the year of study, with nutritional and clinical parameters (including weight, height, body mass index, growth rate of each of these parameters among subjects, serum vitamin levels, fecal nutrient and metabolite content, GI symptoms, and measures of inflammation). We will use massively parallel next- generation DNA sequencing methods, combined with advanced bioinformatic analytical methods, with which we have extensive experience. Our goal is to define the role of the infant CF GI microbiome in growth and nutrition, with the hope of identifying interventions that will improve early growth, and thus long-term outcomes, in CF.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent scientific evidence suggests that the microbes that live in the gastrointestinal tracts of humans and other animals play key roles in the metabolism of nutrients, harvest of energy for the host, and the uptake of vitamins. Therefore, these microbes may be important contributors to diseases in which nutrients are poorly absorbed, the gastrointestinal tract is diseased, and/or the host grows poorly. The aim of this project is to determine the role of gastrointestinal microbes in the relentless and difficult-to-treat growth failure in children with the genetic disease cystic fibrosis, with the hope of both identifying interventions that will lead to better nutritional outcomes in these and in other children with poo early growth.            ",The relationship of fecal microbiomes and nutritional status in CF,8815576,R01DK095869,"['Address', 'Ancillary Study', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Genes', 'Bacteroides', 'Bioinformatics', 'Body mass index', 'Breast Feeding', 'Carbohydrates', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Dietary intake', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Enrollment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evolution', 'Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency', 'Failure', 'Fat-Soluble Vitamin', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Feces', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Harvest', 'Health', 'Height', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Infant', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Intestinal Diseases', 'Intestinal Obstruction', 'Intestines', 'Lead', 'Leukocyte L1 Antigen Complex', 'Life', 'Life Expectancy', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Longevity', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malabsorption Syndromes', 'Malnutrition', 'Massive Parallel Sequencing', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Micronutrients', 'Minerals', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Neonatal Screening', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional', 'Nutritional Study', 'Nutritional status', 'Observational Study', 'Obstruction', 'Outcome', 'Pancreatic enzyme', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteobacteria', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Specimen', 'Study models', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Vitamins', 'Volatile Fatty Acids', 'Weight', 'absorption', 'analytical method', 'aqueous', 'candidate marker', 'children with cystic fibrosis', 'design', 'dosage', 'early cystic fibrosis', 'enzyme replacement therapy', 'experience', 'gastrointestinal', 'gastrointestinal sign', 'gastrointestinal symptom', 'gut microbiota', 'improved', 'infancy', 'infant nutrition', 'meetings', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'mortality', 'next generation', 'novel', 'nutrient metabolism', 'nutrition', 'public health relevance', 'routine care', 'uptake']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2014,675943,0.0700545120731259
"Computer-based simulation Pediatric disaster Triage Training for Emergency Medica  ABSTRACT Children are not small adults. Nowhere is this understanding more critical than in the aftermath of a disaster event, when the strained resources of healthcare providers must be directed where they can do the most good in the least time. Frontline responders are unfortunately rarely trained in the principles and practice of pediatric disaster triage and often do not understand the special pediatric needs and considerations they must take into account when acting decisively and quickly to direct actions in a stressful situation that is often chaotic and always taxing. Researchers at Yale University School of Medicine (YSM) have developed a live simulation training protocol on pediatric disaster triage that has been shown to be effective but also relatively expensive, resource-intensive and therefore difficult to disseminate widely. The Yale New Haven Health System Center for Healthcare Solutions (YNHHS-CHS) has taken up this challenge, proposing to use YNHHS-CHS expertise with online training solutions and web development to create and implement a computer-based simulation that will build on the live simulation model and carry the research into a new medium that will be more cost-effective and able to more broadly engage and educate greater numbers of emergency medical service providers (EMSPs). YNHHS-CHS specialists with design and training skills will use the expertise of YSM pediatric emergency medicine specialists Mark Cicero, MD, who developed the live simulation training, and Marc Auerbach, MD, and the YNHHS-CHS network of emergency management contacts to engage EMSPs in this learning process. The computer- based simulation training will be delivered to 600 EMSPs in southern New England (Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts) and evaluated for future broader dissemination. Multiple retention evaluations, scenario-based and decision-tree driven, will be conducted: immediately at the end of the online training and at three- and six-month intervals post-training to determine the value of the training in delivering information and fostering the ability to apply it in simulated scenarios. A 10% random sampling of participants will also take an in-person live simulation retention evaluation to further assess and demonstrate the usefulness of the training. The project objective is to achieve a success rate of >80% of learners performing pediatric disaster triage with accuracy that is >/=90%. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Emergency planners often focus on large-scale disaster events, but smaller-scale local events are far more common and together have a much greater impact on the health and well-being of communities - particularly events involving children, such as bus accidents or school-related crises. Children are often present at a disaster site and sorting out their needs and requirements can be a significant challenge to emergency medical service providers. This project brings together Yale School of Medicine pediatric emergency medicine specialists and Yale New Haven Health System Center for Healthcare Solutions instructional design and emergency management experts who are committed to developing a training that delivers the greatest possible efficiency and effectiveness with the greatest possibl accuracy in making choices and directing appropriate healthcare resources to improve disaster event outcomes and mitigate negative consequences for children, disasters' most vulnerable and often least understood victims.            ",Computer-based simulation Pediatric disaster Triage Training for Emergency Medica,8664515,R18HS022837,[' '],AHRQ,YALE UNIVERSITY,R18,2014,720455,0.02509484150725665
"Innovative Research Methods to Study Children with Multiple Chronic Conditions     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Children with multiple chronic conditions - two or more chronic conditions that affect the person at the same time - represent an important group of individuals who receive inadequate quality of healthcare and experience suboptimal health outcomes. Clinicians, researchers, administrators, and policy experts are currently uninformed on how to best improve care for these children. This is, in part, because of two methodological challenges that are particularly problematic when studying children with multiple chronic conditions: 1) the ability to comprehensively measure and group comorbid conditions in children and 2) the ability to assess pediatric comorbidity burden on a population level. This proposal will validate and test an innovative set of methods that will help overcome these challenges. Although the set of methods, collectively, is new to the study of children with multiple chronic conditions, we have found components of the set to be feasible and valuable in our prior work. The specific aims of this proposal are 1) to adapt for children a publicly available diagnosis classification scheme (i.e., AHRQ's Chronic Condition Indicator and Clinical Classification System) to name and count coexisting chronic conditions in children; 2) to determine the prevalence and the healthcare cost and utilization (total and excessive) of each type of child with multiple chronic conditions; 3) to complete an evidenced-based prioritization process, based on the Pareto Principle, to describe the relative contribution of combinations of chronic conditions to prevalence and to healthcare cost and utilization; and 4) to employ an innovative, machine learning method (i.e., regression tree boosting) to systematically assess every interaction of coexisting chronic conditions in children to predict healthcare cost and utilization The proposed work will be conducted in existing datasets that contain 10.7 million children with comprehensive Medicaid claims data (i.e., community, emergency, home, inpatient, outpatient, pharmacy care, etc.) from 28 states as well as 3.7 million hospitalized children from the all-payer, nationally-representative Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Kids' Inpatient Database developed by Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Use of the methods and results generated from this proposal will help clinics, hospitals, communities, states, health systems, payers, federal agencies, and others identify children with multiple chronic conditions, describe their coexisting conditions, determine which of these children have the largest impact on the pediatric healthcare system, and quantify how much of their health care cost and utilization could be avoided with high quality of care. This information will help prioritize which subgroups of children with multiple chronic conditions to target for comparative effectiveness research, quality improvement initiatives, and health system redesign. This proposal is aligned with the mission of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality to improve the quality of health care for all Americans.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The research in this proposal is relevant to public health because it will rapidly advance our understanding of the U.S. population of children living with multiple chronic conditions. The research will help identify and describe the children living with multiple chronic conditions, as well as the health care cost and utilization experienced by them. The methods and findings from the research will help improve the health and wellbeing of these children.            ",Innovative Research Methods to Study Children with Multiple Chronic Conditions,8726574,R21HS023092,[' '],AHRQ,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2014,179808,0.09421970802192046
"Novel Models to Predict Energy Expenditure and Physical Activity in Preschoolers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Novel approaches to assess physical activity (PA) and predict energy expenditure (EE) are essential for quantifying the characteristically sporadic PA patterns and variable rates of EE of preschool-aged children. Because of methodological limitations, there is a paucity of comprehensive quantitative data on the habitual PA patterns and normative rates of EE in preschoolers. Accelerometers or miniaturized heart rate (HR) monitors are used to assess PA and predict EE, however, the mathematical modeling of accelerometer counts (AC) and HR has been limited to regression models that do not take into account the interdependence of the data and do not exploit all the information in the raw data. In this proposal, we will apply advanced technology (fast- response room calorimetry, doubly labeled water (DLW), accelerometers and miniaturized HR monitors) and sophisticated mathematical modeling techniques to develop and validate prediction models that capture the dynamic nature of PA and EE in preschool-aged children. Cross-sectional time series (CSTS) and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) models will be developed in 88 preschool-aged children using 12-h room respiration calorimetry as the criterion method and validated in an independent sample (n=50) against12-h room respiration calorimetry and the 7-d DLW method. Specific Aims:  1. For assessment of PA using unaxial and triaxial accelerometry (ActiGraph GT1M and GT3X), develop  CSTS and MARS models for prediction of minute-to-minute activity energy expenditure (AEE) based on  subject characteristics and the functional relationship between AC and AEE, measured by 12-h room  respiration calorimetry in 88 preschool-aged children.  2. For classification of sedentary, light, moderate and vigorous levels of PA and awake/sleep periods,  develop, evaluate, and compare algorithms using statistical and machine learning methods.  3. For prediction of EE using accelerometry and HR monitoring (Actiheart), develop CSTS and MARS  models for prediction of minute-by-minute EE and hence TEE based on subject characteristics and the  relationship between AC+HR and EE as measured by 12-h calorimetry in the same 88 preschoolers.  4. Validate the classification algorithms for PA levels and awake/sleep periods developed in Aim 2.  5. Validate the use of uniaxial and triaxial accelerometers for the prediction of AEE based on AC and  subject characteristics, against 12-h calorimetry and the DLW method in an independent sample of 50  preschoolers.  6. Validate the CSTS and MARS models for the prediction of minute-by-minute EE and hence TEE, AEE,  awake EE and sleep EE from AC and HR and subject characteristics against 12-h calorimetry and the  DLW method in the same independent sample of 50 preschoolers.

"Neurobehavioral Contributors to Math Failure: A Reward-Based Learning Framework DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this set of applications, we propose to initiate a new Learning Disabilities Research Hub focusing initially on high risk for mathematics failure. We proposed to situate this new Hub within an existing strong infrastructure for pediatric neurobehavioral and imaging research, the Pediatric Neurocognition, Imaging, and Genetics (PING) data resource. PING infrastructure provides many important advantages for building a new cross disciplinary and multiple-investigator program, as it has already brought together a strong team of behavioral, clinical, imaging, computational, and genetics investigators as a closely integrated team, and most importantly has attracted a very talented group of young investigators and graduate students focused on the problems addressed in the proposed research. A unifying theme of the studies that our team has proposed is the notion that math failure, and perhaps academic failure more broadly, emerges gradually through interactions of putative early conceptual weaknesses, attributable in some cases to poor functioning and anomalous neural architecture in specific neural systems, with increasing reward-based biases that contribute, additively or non-additively, to suppression of the normal learning trajectory. Consistent with this theme we refer to our proposed research hub as the Roles of Emotion and Choice (REaCh) in Learning Disabilities Research Hub (LDRH). The proposed REaCh Hub has 3 components: a new research project to investigate key questions about learning and the neural architecture during early development in children at high risk for math failure, and two cores. The Administrative Core proposal describes the management plan for the new Hub and the PING infrastructure that will be adapted for the new studies; and focuses on a nested mentoring plan for ensuring close interaction between trainees at different levels with mid-level and senior investigators within focused workgroups. The assets of the Core for within-Hub and extra-Hub data sharing are also described. A Developmental Infrastructure Core proposal describes the administration of a small grant program to support novel work within the Hub by junior investigators, trainees, and investigators from disciplines outside of the original REaCh LDRH group. A new Learning Disabilities Research Hub would be created to bring scientists with different kinds of expertise together to study learning disabilities, focusing initially on risk for math failure in young children. The scientists would study learning and brain development in children and focus specifically on the importance of the children's emotional responses to mathematical information.",Neurobehavioral Contributors to Math Failure: A Reward-Based Learning Framework,8554790,R24HD075489,"['12 year old', 'Accounting', 'Achievement', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Animals', 'Anisotropy', 'Anxiety', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Association Learning', 'Attention', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Choice Behavior', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Ensure', 'Exposure to', 'Failure', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurocognition', 'Neurocognitive', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pediatric Research', 'Perception', 'Perceptual learning', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'School-Age Population', 'Scientist', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stimulus', 'Surface', 'System', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'classical conditioning', 'computational neuroscience', 'data sharing', 'elementary school', 'emotional factor', 'experience', 'genome-wide', 'graduate student', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'intraparietal sulcus', 'mathematical model', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'preference', 'programs', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'reward processing', 'skills']",NICHD,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R24,2013,529465,0.053036561022965056
"In utero antidepressant exposures and risk for autism     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In utero exposure to antidepressants was recently associated with increased risk for autism in an analysis of a large health care claims database. This result is consistent with twin studies indicating greater concordance for autism among dizygotic twins compared to non-twin siblings, likely pointing to shared in utero risk. The need to clarify the risk posed by antidepressants is acute, as it has profound public health implications. Confirmation of the finding would support a rare modifiable risk factor for autism, and help to elucidate the underlying pathophysiology of the disorder. Conversely, if the finding is a false positive, it might lead to undertreatment of major depression among pregnant women, with consequent risks to both mother and fetus. The proposed study will utilize electronic medical record (EMR) data from more than 4 million individuals in a large New England health system. The investigators and their colleagues have previously applied an EMR query toolkit, which they helped to develop, to characterize treatment outcomes and conduct pharmacovigilance and genetic studies in psychiatry and beyond. Notably, this health care system includes large obstetrics, psychiatry, and pediatric practices, and is a referral center for child neuropsychiatri disorders. Children ages 4-12 with a diagnosis of autism who were delivered in this system will be identified using validated natural language processing tools. A matched (2:1) cohort of children with a diagnosis of ADHD will be identified, along with a matched (5:1) control cohort of children receiving routine pediatric care. The EMR will then be used to match each child with their mother, allowing characterization of maternal socio-demographic status, medical and psychiatric illness, and medication treatment during pregnancy. To further improve precision, Massachusetts state birth certificate data will be queried. This data includes details of perinatal care, exposures, and complications, as well as paternal age and socio-demographic status. Regression models will be applied to the resulting data set, encompassing more than 700 children with autism, 1400 children with ADHD, and 3500 healthy control children. In addition to examining the association between antidepressant exposure and autism liability, with appropriate control for confounding, this data set will allow investigation of other putative in utero and perinatal risk factors, creating a key resource for future studies. This project will innovate in two key respects. First, it will address the problem of confounding by indication present in prior antidepressant pharmacovigilance studies, using tools developed by the investigators for characterizing depression severity/comorbidity and course to better match cases and controls. Second, it will establish the utility of an EMR-based approach for studying pregnancy exposures and outcomes.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will estimate the amount of autism risk, if any, associated with exposure to antidepressants and other medicines before birth. This information will allow mothers to make more informed decisions weighing the risks and benefits of treatment for depression and related illnesses during pregnancy. It may also contribute to a better understanding of the causes of autism itself.            ",In utero antidepressant exposures and risk for autism,8483291,R01MH100286,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Age', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Anxiety', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavioral', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Birth', 'Birth Certificates', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Comorbidity', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Dizygotic Twins', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Fetus', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Load', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Insurance Claim Review', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Massachusetts', 'Maternal Exposure', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'New England', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Paternal Age', 'Perinatal', 'Perinatal Care', 'Perinatal Exposure', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor', 'Severities', 'Siblings', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment outcome', 'Twin Studies', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'case control', 'clinical application', 'cohort', 'data mining', 'depressive symptoms', 'improved', 'in utero', 'innovation', 'interest', 'maternal depression', 'modifiable risk', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'prenatal risk factor', 'public health relevance', 'randomized trial', 'sample collection', 'tool']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2013,343560,0.014744478336495389
"A preschool biomarker for literacy     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As many as one in ten children have the poor reading and spelling skills that comprise developmental dyslexia. It is widely accepted that there is a neurological basis; however, the nature of that basis is hotly debated. Nevertheless, one consistent view is that poor phonological processing-the ability to access and manipulate the sound units of language-is involved in dyslexia. Indeed, a majority of children with reading deficits exhibit difficulties on an array of phonological processing tasks. A growing body of research has discovered that speech-sound transcription, as measured by electrophysiology, shows striking relationships with phonological processing skills and reading ability in school-age children. As such, we have developed a suite of subcortical and cortical physiological tests that probe some of the core deficits that researchers have postulated as the root elements of poor phonological processing. We will target the subcortical processing of time-varying signals and stimulus regularities, and cortical hemispheric specialization to both fast and slow signals. In a longitudinal cohort of four- to eight-year-olds, we will model the normal neurological speech transcription process, quantify its development, and examine its relationship with the development of literacy-related skills. Our intention is that by leveraging these electrophysiological probes to a pre-reading age group, a biomarker, in preschoolers, may be found that predicts a child's eventual reading skill as he/she progresses through the primary grades. If such a biomarker is found, it would pave the way for earlier and more effectively targeted intervention.          As objective neurophysiological measures of literacy become available, a logical step is to apply what has been learned about subcortical and cortical physiology and their relationships with reading to young pre- readers. The outcome of the proposed work will be a deeper understanding of the biological underpinnings of literacy, particularly in pre-literate children, and a means to exploit objective biological responses as biomarkers of future literacy. This outcome will positively impact our understanding of the core deficits leading to poor reading, and has the potential to spur early intervention programs to head off the potential onset of developmental dyslexia.

"Microbial Diversity and Genetic Characterization of Cariogenic Biofilms    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed studies are anticipated to yield important new information as to the presence of specific genetic determinants found in Streptococcus mutans, a microbe strongly associated with a severe dental caries in affecting young children called severe early childhood caries or S-ECC. The long-term benefit of such information should lead researchers toward devising both diagnostic and preventive strategies against dental though better understanding its microbial causation. Using a powerful technique of suppressive subtraction DNA hybridization, the first specific aim is to test the hypothesis that strains of S. mutans found in S-ECC children differ in genetic composition compared to strains found in caries-free (CF) children. Unique genetic loci that are specific to S-ECC strains will be identified and characterized. Some of these genetic loci will prove informative as biomarkers for health or disease. Using the power of multiple test analyses derived artificial intelligence programming; biomarkers will be used as the basis for a modeling algorithm capable of classifying strains of S. mutans in one of two categories (S-ECC or CF). The second aim of this study is to survey strains of S. mutans associated with either S-ECC or CF status for known or suspected genetic elements thought to influence the pathogenesis or virulence of S. mutans. The third aim is to survey a larger, racial/ethnical diverse population of S-ECC or CF children for the presence or absence of the biomarkers identified in the first two aims. It is anticipated that this research will yield genetic markers for disease capable of providing clinicians with a diagnostic test that can assess risk for developing S-ECC. 7.           n/a",Microbial Diversity and Genetic Characterization of Cariogenic Biofilms,8205040,R01DE013937,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Markers', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Coupling', 'DNA', 'Dental', 'Dental caries', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Dot Immunoblotting', 'Effectiveness', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomic Islands', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Hispanics', 'Infant', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Microbe', 'Microbial Biofilms', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mothers', 'Pathogenesis', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention strategy', 'Process', 'Programmed Learning', 'Public Health', 'Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'SHH gene', 'Series', 'Severity of illness', 'Streptococcus mutans', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Virulence', 'Virulence Factors', 'base', 'early childhood', 'experience', 'genetic element', 'microbial', 'programs', 'research study', 'tool']",NIDCR,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2012,364134,0.029656148266494573

"Neurobehavioral Contributors to Math Failure: A Reward-Based Learning Framework     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this set of applications, we propose to initiate a new Learning Disabilities Research Hub focusing initially on high risk for mathematics failure. We proposed to situate this new Hub within an existing strong infrastructure for pediatric neurobehavioral and imaging research, the Pediatric Neurocognition, Imaging, and Genetics (PING) data resource. PING infrastructure provides many important advantages for building a new cross disciplinary and multiple-investigator program, as it has already brought together a strong team of behavioral, clinical, imaging, computational, and genetics investigators as a closely integrated team, and most importantly has attracted a very talented group of young investigators and graduate students focused on the problems addressed in the proposed research. A unifying theme of the studies that our team has proposed is the notion that math failure, and perhaps academic failure more broadly, emerges gradually through interactions of putative early conceptual weaknesses, attributable in some cases to poor functioning and anomalous neural architecture in specific neural systems, with increasing reward-based biases that contribute, additively or non-additively, to suppression of the normal learning trajectory. Consistent with this theme we refer to our proposed research hub as the Roles of Emotion and Choice (REaCh) in Learning Disabilities Research Hub (LDRH). The proposed REaCh Hub has 3 components: a new research project to investigate key questions about learning and the neural architecture during eariy development in children at high risk for math failure, and two cores. The Administrative Core proposal describes the management  plan for the new Hub and the PING infrastructure that will be adapted for the new studies; and focuses on a  nested mentoring plan for ensuring close interaction between trainees at different levels with mid-level and  senior investigators within focused workgroups. The assets of the Core for within-Hub and extra-Hub data sharing are also described. A Developmental Infrastructure Core proposal describes the administration of a small grant program to support novel work within the Hub by junior investigators, trainees, and investigators  from disciplines outside ofthe original REaCh LDRH group.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A new Learning Disabilities Research Hub would be created to bring scientists with different kinds of expertise together to study learning disabilities, focuing initially on risk for math failure in young children.

"A preschool biomarker for literacy     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As many as one in ten children have the poor reading and spelling skills that comprise developmental dyslexia. It is widely accepted that there is a neurological basis; however, the nature of that basis is hotly debated. Nevertheless, one consistent view is that poor phonological processing-the ability to access and manipulate the sound units of language-is involved in dyslexia. Indeed, a majority of children with reading deficits exhibit difficulties on an array of phonological processing tasks. A growing body of research has discovered that speech-sound transcription, as measured by electrophysiology, shows striking relationships with phonological processing skills and reading ability in school-age children. As such, we have developed a suite of subcortical and cortical physiological tests that probe some of the core deficits that researchers have postulated as the root elements of poor phonological processing. We will target the subcortical processing of time-varying signals and stimulus regularities, and cortical hemispheric specialization to both fast and slow signals. In a longitudinal cohort of four- to eight-year-olds, we will model the normal neurological speech transcription process, quantify its development, and examine its relationship with the development of literacy-related skills. Our intention is that by leveraging these electrophysiological probes to a pre-reading age group, a biomarker, in preschoolers, may be found that predicts a child's eventual reading skill as he/she progresses through the primary grades. If such a biomarker is found, it would pave the way for earlier and more effectively targeted intervention.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: As objective neurophysiological measures of literacy become available, a logical step is to apply what has been learned about subcortical and cortical physiology and their relationships with reading to young pre- readers. The outcome of the proposed work will be a deeper understanding of the biological underpinnings of literacy, particularly in pre-literate children, and a means to exploit objective biological responses as biomarkers of future literacy. This outcome will positively impact our understanding of the core deficits leading to poor reading, and has the potential to spur early intervention programs to head off the potential onset of developmental dyslexia.              As objective neurophysiological measures of literacy become available, a logical step is to apply what has been learned about subcortical and cortical physiology and their relationships with reading to young pre- readers.

"Microbial Diversity and Genetic Characterization of Cariogenic Biofilms    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed studies are anticipated to yield important new information as to the presence of specific genetic determinants found in Streptococcus mutans, a microbe strongly associated with a severe dental caries in affecting young children called severe early childhood caries or S-ECC. The long-term benefit of such information should lead researchers toward devising both diagnostic and preventive strategies against dental though better understanding its microbial causation. Using a powerful technique of suppressive subtraction DNA hybridization, the first specific aim is to test the hypothesis that strains of S. mutans found in S-ECC children differ in genetic composition compared to strains found in caries-free (CF) children. Unique genetic loci that are specific to S-ECC strains will be identified and characterized. Some of these genetic loci will prove informative as biomarkers for health or disease. Using the power of multiple test analyses derived artificial intelligence programming; biomarkers will be used as the basis for a modeling algorithm capable of classifying strains of S. mutans in one of two categories (S-ECC or CF). The second aim of this study is to survey strains of S. mutans associated with either S-ECC or CF status for known or suspected genetic elements thought to influence the pathogenesis or virulence of S. mutans. The third aim is to survey a larger, racial/ethnical diverse population of S-ECC or CF children for the presence or absence of the biomarkers identified in the first two aims. It is anticipated that this research will yield genetic markers for disease capable of providing clinicians with a diagnostic test that can assess risk for developing S-ECC. 7.           n/a",Microbial Diversity and Genetic Characterization of Cariogenic Biofilms,8004929,R01DE013937,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Markers', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Coupling', 'DNA', 'Dental', 'Dental caries', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Dot Immunoblotting', 'Effectiveness', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomic Islands', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Hispanics', 'Infant', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Microbe', 'Microbial Biofilms', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mothers', 'Pathogenesis', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention strategy', 'Process', 'Programmed Learning', 'Public Health', 'Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'SHH gene', 'Series', 'Severity of illness', 'Streptococcus mutans', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Virulence', 'Virulence Factors', 'base', 'early childhood', 'experience', 'genetic element', 'microbial', 'programs', 'research study', 'tool']",NIDCR,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2011,353329,0.029656148266494573
"Novel Models to Predict Energy Expenditure and Physical Activity in Preschoolers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Novel approaches to assess physical activity (PA) and predict energy expenditure (EE) are essential for quantifying the characteristically sporadic PA patterns and variable rates of EE of preschool-aged children. Because of methodological limitations, there is a paucity of comprehensive quantitative data on the habitual PA patterns and normative rates of EE in preschoolers. Accelerometers or miniaturized heart rate (HR) monitors are used to assess PA and predict EE, however, the mathematical modeling of accelerometer counts (AC) and HR has been limited to regression models that do not take into account the interdependence of the data and do not exploit all the information in the raw data. In this proposal, we will apply advanced technology (fast- response room calorimetry, doubly labeled water (DLW), accelerometers and miniaturized HR monitors) and sophisticated mathematical modeling techniques to develop and validate prediction models that capture the dynamic nature of PA and EE in preschool-aged children. Cross-sectional time series (CSTS) and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) models will be developed in 88 preschool-aged children using 12-h room respiration calorimetry as the criterion method and validated in an independent sample (n=50) against12-h room respiration calorimetry and the 7-d DLW method.

For assessment of PA using unaxial and triaxial accelerometry (ActiGraph GT1M and GT3X), develop  CSTS and MARS models for prediction of minute-to-minute activity energy expenditure (AEE) based on  subject characteristics and the functional relationship between AC and AEE, measured by 12-h room  respiration calorimetry in 88 preschool-aged children.  2. For classification of sedentary, light, moderate and vigorous levels of PA and awake/sleep periods,  develop, evaluate, and compare algorithms using statistical and machine learning methods.  3. For prediction of EE using accelerometry and HR monitoring (Actiheart), develop CSTS and MARS  models for prediction of minute-by-minute EE and hence TEE based on subject characteristics and the  relationship between AC+HR and EE as measured by 12-h calorimetry in the same 88 preschoolers.  4. Validate the classification algorithms for PA levels and awake/sleep periods developed in Aim 2.  5. Validate the use of uniaxial and triaxial accelerometers for the prediction of AEE based on AC and  subject characteristics, against 12-h calorimetry and the DLW method in an independent sample of 50  preschoolers.  6. Validate the CSTS and MARS models for the prediction of minute-by-minute EE and hence TEE, AEE,  awake EE and sleep EE from AC and HR and subject characteristics against 12-h calorimetry and the  DLW method in the same independent sample of 50 preschoolers.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  In the US, childhood obesity has been increasing at alarming rates, particularly among preschool-aged children.

"Longitudinal validity of accelerometry in youth    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since the inception of parent grant (July 2007), pattern recognition approaches such as neural networks, decision trees, Bayesian classifiers, and hidden Markov models have emerged as a viable and potentially more accurate alternative to traditional regression based cut-point methods. Whereas cut-point methods have proven to be modestly useful for broadly classifying the absolute intensity of physical activity, preliminary findings from the parent grant suggest that regression-based cut-point methods lack the accuracy required to provide valid point estimates of total and physical activity energy expenditure in field-based studies. Recently, pattern recognition approaches have been shown to be feasible and accurate using count data collected in 1-second increments by the widely used Actigraph accelerometer. The overarching goal of this competitive revision is to apply novel pattern recognition or machine learning data processing techniques to estimate physical activity type and intensity from high resolution accelerometer count data collected in children and adolescents as part of the ongoing parent grant. The proposed new aims are as follows: 1) To formulate and apply pattern recognition data processing techniques (multivariate hidden Markov models) to predict physical activity type and intensity from 1-second accelerometer count data collected in an age-diverse cohort children and adolescent; and 2) to compare the accuracy of physical activity intensity predictions provided by pattern recognition data processing techniques and traditional regression-based cut-point methods at baseline, and after 12-, 24-, and 36-months of follow-up.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The results of the proposed study will enable researchers to more effectively reduce and interpret accelerometer data collected in longitudinal studies of youth as well as population- based studies involving age diverse samples of children and adolescents. Moreover, the new aims will inform the development of new computational approaches for predicting physical activity energy expenditure in free-living children and adolescents.

Whether addressing asthma, diabetes, obesity, or tooth decay, needed now is trans-disciplinary translational research that tailors pharmacological and behavioral interventions to care management plans that parents are able to implement successfully. Envisioned is a computer ""Tool"" for use in community sites that assists community health workers in collaboration with families to: (1) determine children's level of risk for chronic diseases, (2) match them to clinicians and care plans, (3) characterize a family's capacity to engage in such plans, and (4) modify care plans to meet family's capacities. Target families are those disadvantaged by low-income, low-literacy, cultural barriers and minority status. Specific research aims are to develop, pilot test, and refine two ""Instruments"" that are integral to this Tool: (1) a 'disease risk assessment instrument' and (2) a culturally adaptable 'family capacity assessment instrument.' Early childhood caries (""ECC"") was selected as the exemplar chronic disease for this research by an existing 12-member multi-disciplinary Project Team comprised of social and behavioral scientists, clinicians, educational and informatics technologists, and health services researchers. ECC was selected because it is highly prevalent in young children, because preventive and therapeutic bio- behavioral therapies are available but underused, and because significant cost savings may accrue to governmental programs, insurers, and families if the need for dental repair can be reduced. The proposed 'disease risk assessment instrument' will experiment with inputting recognized biological (clinical, laboratory, psychological, and pharmacologic), and non biological (knowledge, logistic, socio-cultural, and environmental) risk factors into algorithm-supported ""classification and regression tree analyses"" and machine learning ""artificial neural networks"" to improve on current professionally-endorsed methods of classifying young children by risk. As the proposed 'family capacity assessment instrument' has been less developed to date by the Project Team, its ultimate form will be determined by this research. Success in developing and implementing the Tool and its two assessment Instruments can result in better oral health outcomes at lower cost through risk-based early intervention, disease suppression, individualized care, family engagement, and elimination of the need for dental surgery in children under the age of six. Findings of this research will support clinical trials of risk-based caries management in vulnerable minority child populations and is adaptable to management of other chronic diseases in young children.

"Cognitive Representation in Specific Language Impairment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this project is to investigate the nature of implicit learning in children with Specific Language Impairment (SLI). A key question is whether the language impairments seen in these children are due to impaired cognitive processing mechanisms or are a representational deficit in a specific grammar module. Recently, it has been proposed that: (1) the syntax, morphology, auditory processing, and working memory deficits seen in children with SLI are due instead to a procedural implicit learning deficit, and (2) the relatively spared vocabulary abilities in children with SLI suggests an intact declarative learning system that may function as a compensatory mechanism in their language acquisition. Procedural memory is used in the learning of sequential, cognitive, and perceptual motor skills. Recent work suggests, however, that SLI may instead be a domain general implicit learning impairment that extends beyond procedural learning to include category learning, statistical, and artificial grammar learning, and that this implicit learning impairment may extend beyond the perceptual motor system to include the auditory and visual modalities as well. The purpose of this project is to determine if implicit learning in children with SLI is a domain general or domain specific impairment. A total of 170 children will participate in this 5-year project, including 85 children with SLI, 7-9 years of age and 85 normal language controls (CA) matched on chronological age, nonverbal IQ, and maternal education. A total of 9 implicit learning studies are proposed. Studies 1-3 will examine directly whether implicit learning in children with SLI (N = 45) is impaired for implicit category, statistical, and artificial grammar learning on tasks designed to have auditory, visual, and perceptual motor isomorphs as compared to CA controls (N = 45). Studies 4-6 will examine the nature and time course of implicit category, statistical, and artificial grammar learning in the auditory modality and ask if this knowledge transfers to visual and perceptual motor modalities in children with SLI (N = 40) and CA controls (N = 40). Studies 7-9 ask whether implicit learning predicts not only syntax and morphology knowledge, but also vocabulary knowledge, in both children with SLI (N = 85) and CA controls (N = 85). Theoretically, these studies extend our understanding of linguistic and nonlinguistic deficits in children with SLI by clarifying the extent to which modality specific or general implicit learning deficits may contribute to the language impairments seen in these children. Clinically, these studies will provide valuable insights into the nature and intensity of intervention that may be required to facilitate the implicit learning of abstract representations in children with SLI, and will lead to the development of effective intervention models for school-aged children with SLI who are at risk for severe difficulties in communication, reading, writing, and academic failure. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The purpose of this project is to investigate implicit learning in children with Specific Language Impairment (SLI). There is evidence to suggest that children with SLI may have a domain general deficit in implicit learning. Implicit learning is gradual, occurring on an ongoing basis across multiple trials or exemplars, and appears to be the mechanism by which language is learned in typically developing children. The studies proposed in this project address the gap in our understanding of implicit learning abilities in children with SLI by directly examining the extent to which children with SLI may have a modality general implicit learning impairment.

"Microbial Diversity and Genetic Characterization of Cariogenic Biofilms    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed studies are anticipated to yield important new information as to the presence of specific genetic determinants found in Streptococcus mutans, a microbe strongly associated with a severe dental caries in affecting young children called severe early childhood caries or S-ECC. The long-term benefit of such information should lead researchers toward devising both diagnostic and preventive strategies against dental though better understanding its microbial causation. Using a powerful technique of suppressive subtraction DNA hybridization, the first specific aim is to test the hypothesis that strains of S. mutans found in S-ECC children differ in genetic composition compared to strains found in caries-free (CF) children. Unique genetic loci that are specific to S-ECC strains will be identified and characterized. Some of these genetic loci will prove informative as biomarkers for health or disease. Using the power of multiple test analyses derived artificial intelligence programming; biomarkers will be used as the basis for a modeling algorithm capable of classifying strains of S. mutans in one of two categories (S-ECC or CF). The second aim of this study is to survey strains of S. mutans associated with either S-ECC or CF status for known or suspected genetic elements thought to influence the pathogenesis or virulence of S. mutans. The third aim is to survey a larger, racial/ethnical diverse population of S-ECC or CF children for the presence or absence of the biomarkers identified in the first two aims. It is anticipated that this research will yield genetic markers for disease capable of providing clinicians with a diagnostic test that can assess risk for developing S-ECC. 7.           n/a",Microbial Diversity and Genetic Characterization of Cariogenic Biofilms,7568847,R01DE013937,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Markers', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Coupling', 'DNA', 'Dental', 'Dental caries', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Dot Immunoblotting', 'Effectiveness', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomic Islands', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Hispanics', 'Infant', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Microbe', 'Microbial Biofilms', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mothers', 'Pathogenesis', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention strategy', 'Process', 'Programmed Learning', 'Public Health', 'Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Severity of illness', 'Streptococcus mutans', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Virulence', 'Virulence Factors', 'base', 'early childhood', 'experience', 'genetic element', 'microbial', 'programs', 'research study', 'tool']",NIDCR,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2009,370919,0.029656148266494573

Studies 1-3 will examine directly whether implicit learning in children with SLI (N = 45) is impaired for implicit category, statistical, and artificial grammar learning on tasks designed to have auditory, visual, and perceptual motor isomorphs as compared to CA controls (N = 45). Studies 4-6 will examine the nature and time course of implicit category, statistical, and artificial grammar learning in the auditory modality and ask if this knowledge transfers to visual and perceptual motor modalities in children with SLI (N = 40) and CA controls (N = 40). Studies 7-9 ask whether implicit learning predicts not only syntax and morphology knowledge, but also vocabulary knowledge, in both children with SLI (N = 85) and CA controls (N = 85). Theoretically, these studies extend our understanding of linguistic and nonlinguistic deficits in children with SLI by clarifying the extent to which modality specific or general implicit learning deficits may contribute to the language impairments seen in these children. Clinically, these studies will provide valuable insights into the nature and intensity of intervention that may be required to facilitate the implicit learning of abstract representations in children with SLI, and will lead to the development of effective intervention models for school-aged children with SLI who are at risk for severe difficulties in communication, reading, writing, and academic failure. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The purpose of this project is to investigate implicit learning in children with Specific Language Impairment (SLI). There is evidence to suggest that children with SLI may have a domain general deficit in implicit learning. Implicit learning is gradual, occurring on an ongoing basis across multiple trials or exemplars, and appears to be the mechanism by which language is learned in typically developing children. The studies proposed in this project address the gap in our understanding of implicit learning abilities in children with SLI by directly examining the extent to which children with SLI may have a modality general implicit learning impairment. The findings from this research will provide valuable insights into the nature and intensity of intervention that may be required to facilitate the language learning in children with language impairments, and will aid the development of effective intervention models for school-aged children with language impairments who are at risk for severe difficulties in communication, reading, writing, and academic failure.          n/a",Cognitive Representation in Specific Language Impairment,7470513,R01DC005650,"['Address', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Auditory', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Conscious', 'Development', 'Education', 'Emotional', 'Exposure to', 'Failure', 'Habits', 'Hearing', 'Impairment', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Language Disorders', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Motor Skills', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Purpose', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Risk', 'School-Age Population', 'Secondary to', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Time', 'Visual', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'Writing', 'abstracting', 'base', 'design', 'experience', 'implicit memory', 'improved', 'insight', 'lexical', 'motor skill learning', 'novel', 'procedural memory', 'specific language impairment', 'success', 'syntax', 'visual process', 'visual processing']",NIDCD,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2008,307451,0.024834012742154157
"Using Absence-Causing Symptoms to Monitor Child Health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       On any given weekday, more than one-fifth of the U.S. population is in schools. While we all want schools to be safe places-havens for learning-schoolchildren today face serious health threats including bioterrorism. In the proper project, we will develop and evaluate a system called ASIAN (Absenteeism-causing Symptom-Level Assessment Network), designed to monitor the health of children in schools. Our system focuses on monitoring children's school attendance, because most experts agree that absenteeism from school is an early sign of an outbreak in a community. However, school absenteeism is not a precise sign of an outbreak or epidemic. Absenteeism is often not even related to illness, reflecting, instead, problems in the child's home environment, important social or cultural obligations, and even opportunities for family recreation. But what if a system could identify absences due to illnesses and collect data on the symptoms causing the illness-related absences? Such a system might well offer an early, highly specific signal of an illness in a population, allowing public and school health officials to detect outbreaks in schools very early in their course. We propose to develop a VoiceXML speech processing system that can accurately capture during a brief telephone interview the symptoms a person is experiencing that are causing an absence. We propose to modify the ""work processes"" school districts use to have parents or guardians report that their children will be absent from school. Parents will use the interactive voice response questionnaire (or a web site, if they prefer) to report (on a voluntary basis) the symptoms that are causing the child's absence. We believe that monitoring of reports of such symptoms could both protect the health of children from bioterrorist attacks and from toxins in the environment. It could also improve their health on a daily basis by helping school nurses identify children with poorly managed chronic illnesses, and recognize and manage the routine outbreaks of infectious diseases that occur each year. The study plan focuses on creation of a computer telephone interviewing system and a formative evaluation that will include both qualitative and quantitative components and will assess the feasibility, validity, and potential usefulness of the system.             n/a",Using Absence-Causing Symptoms to Monitor Child Health,7497109,R21EB007466,"['Absenteeism', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Asthma', 'Bioterrorism', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Child health care', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cognitive', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Community Health', 'Computers', 'Daily', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Education', 'Educational Materials', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emerging Communicable Diseases', 'Environment', 'Environmental Hazards', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exanthema', 'Face', 'Family', 'Fever', 'Goals', 'Head Nurses', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Technology', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Incentives', 'Informatics', 'Internet', 'Interview', 'Just-in-time-concept', 'Laboratory Study', 'Learning', 'Medical Surveillance', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Natural Disasters', 'Nausea', 'Nursing Schools', 'Occupational Health Nursing', 'Parents', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Primary Schools', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Questionnaires', 'Readiness', 'Recreation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'School Nursing', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Self Care', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Students', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Telephone Interviews', 'Terrorism', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Today', 'Toxin', 'Validation', 'Voice', 'Work', 'base', 'design', 'elementary school', 'experience', 'hazard', 'high school', 'improved', 'multidisciplinary', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'research study', 'response', 'school health', 'social', 'speech processing', 'syndromic surveillance', 'tool', 'voice recognition']",NIBIB,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R21,2008,189263,0.07015449399639916

"The development of fluent and automatic reading                                                                                         DESCRIPTION (Adapted from Applicant's Abstract): Being able to read fluently         is a critical developmental step in all young children's education. Reading          fluency is necessary for learning from science and social studies texts in           later grades. The objectives of the proposal is to investigate the development       of fluency and automaticity in early elementary school reading. The research         will refine existing programs for the development of fluent reading in               classrooms and remedial reading settings.  The study has three goals: (a) to         develop and validate pedagogical approaches to developing reading fluency,           specifically repeated reading and wide reading approaches; (b) to determine          the effectiveness of approaches to providing remedial support for                    low-achieving children including decoding instruction, speeded word                  identification strategies, and repeated reading strategies; (c) to develop an        empirically-based model of the development of fluency in beginning readers,          particularly obligatoriness, speed, and resource availability aspects of             fluent reading. Strand 1 will train classroom teachers in Fluency-Oriented           Reading Instruction (Stahl, Heubach, & Cramond, 1997) and Wide Reading               approaches in their classrooms in schools in Atlanta, Rural Georgia, and New         Jersey. The development of fluency in children in these classrooms will be           measured through standardized and experimental methods both immediately              following the intervention and a year later, and these children will be              compared to the development of fluency in children receiving a traditional           reading instruction. Effective methods will be implemented and disseminated.         Strand 2 will examine remedial aspects of reading instruction designed to            promote the development of fluent and automatic reading in struggling readers.       This strand will examine the effectiveness of both Phonological and Strategy         Training, Speeded Word Retrieval, and Repeated Reading strategies, both singly       and in combination. The effectiveness of these will be compared to a                 traditional remedial instruction control. Both immediate and long term               follow-up measures, on both standardized achievement and experimental                measures, will be conducted to follow the progress of these children. Strand 3       will examine how the aspects associated with automatic reading:                      obligatoriness, speed, and resource availability change together during the          development of fluent reading during the second grade. Both a cross-sectional        and two-year longitudinal study are planned. By examining all of these aspects       together in a single longitudinal study, a richer description and theoretical        base for the development of fluent reading skill will be obtained. This strand       will also develop the experimental measures of reading fluency to be used in         the other strands, The research conducted will add valuable knowledge                regarding the ways to foster fluent automatic reading in young elementary            school children.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               n/a",The development of fluent and automatic reading,6805733,R01HD040746,"['academic achievement', 'artificial intelligence', 'clinical research', 'computer assisted instruction', 'education evaluation /planning', 'educational resource design /development', 'elementary school', 'human subject', 'information dissemination', 'interview', 'longitudinal human study', 'mathematical model', 'middle childhood (6-11)', 'model design /development', 'phonology', 'reading disorder', 'remedial /special education', 'rural area', 'speech', 'teacher', 'training', 'urban poverty area']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA (UGA),R01,2005,587574,0.08245025456189504
"A NEURAL NETWORK APPROACH TO PEDIATRIC TRAUMA TRIAGE    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Injuries result in more deaths in children than all other causes combined. Because injured children have better outcomes at centers with specialized trauma care, appropriate transport to these centers may reduce morbidity and mortality. Prehospital information must be used to determine the need for transport to a trauma center and for planning care after arrival. Several triage schemes have been evaluated for stratifying minimally and severely injured children based on prehospital information. These have used a diverse range of inputs, including physiological parameters, anatomic site of injury and mechanism of injury, and have used both linear techniques of analysis and logistic regression. Despite these efforts, no pediatric trauma triage method has yet met the goal of being sufficiently accurate (avoiding under- or over-triage) and reproducible. One potential explanation for the limited success of triage criteria developed using standard regression and classification techniques is the complexity of prehospital data and the uncertain relationship of this data to outcome. Neural networks are a family of models that have an advantage over conventional methods when classification requires using different types of input data or the relationships between these variables and the final classification are vaguely understood. While their use for triage has not been described, neural networks have been better than logistic regression methods in predicting morbidity and mortality in adult trauma patients. Neural networks may be well suited for analysis of pediatric trauma triage because of the diversity and age-specificity of prehospital variables and the uncertain relationship between these variables and the outcome of injured children. These observations have led to the hypothesis that a neural network can more accurately classify pediatric trauma patients by severity of injury and need for hospital resources than current triage methods. Neural networks will be trained to classify injured children based on severity of injury and need for hospital resources using information available to prehospital providers. The classification accuracy of trained networks will be compared with that based on current triage strategies.

"Determinants of Behavior Problems after Divorce  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The processes responsible for the association between divorce and adjustment in adults and their offspring are not well understood. The higher rates of behavioral and psychological problems in adults and children from divorced families were originally considered to be consequences of marital disruption, but may also reflect nonrandom selection of families into divorce. In order to disentangle these processes, the proposed research will utilize data from a longitudinal study of Australian adult twins and their offspring. First, analyses of monozygotic and dizygotic adult twins discordant for divorce will examine how genetic and environmental processes account for the increased problems among divorced individuals. Second, the children of twins design will investigate the causal and selection factors responsible for the relation between marital dissolution and functioning in young-adult offspring. Third, the proposed analyses will assess how family and individual characteristics mediate the environmental and genetic influences associated with offspring's adjustment to their parents' divorce. Finally, training opportunities will provide the opportunity to explore whether the family environment controls genetic expression of offspring behavior problems, use longitudinal data to study developmental changes in children's response to family conflict, and employ decision tree analyses to study how multiple risk and protective factors interact to influence child development. The proposed research seeks to move beyond simple associations between familial characteristics and outcomes and elucidate causal mechanisms by utilizing genetically informative designs, longitudinal data, and advanced quantitative methods.   n/a",Determinants of Behavior Problems after Divorce,6656262,F31MH067300,"['behavioral /social science research tag', ' behavioral genetics', ' clinical research', ' conflict', ' developmental psychology', ' divorce /separation', ' family structure /dynamics', ' functional ability', ' gene environment interaction', ' human data', ' longitudinal human study', ' parent offspring interaction', ' personality', ' predoctoral investigator', ' psychological adaptation', ' psychological stressor', ' social behavior', ' socioenvironment', ' twin /multiplet']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA CHARLOTTESVILLE,F31,2003,25481,0.02669399314594677

"Determinants of Behavior Problems after Divorce  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The processes responsible for the association between divorce and adjustment in adults and their offspring are not well understood. The higher rates of behavioral and psychological problems in adults and children from divorced families were originally considered to be consequences of marital disruption, but may also reflect nonrandom selection of families into divorce. In order to disentangle these processes, the proposed research will utilize data from a longitudinal study of Australian adult twins and their offspring. First, analyses of monozygotic and dizygotic adult twins discordant for divorce will examine how genetic and environmental processes account for the increased problems among divorced individuals. Second, the children of twins design will investigate the causal and selection factors responsible for the relation between marital dissolution and functioning in young-adult offspring. Third, the proposed analyses will assess how family and individual characteristics mediate the environmental and genetic influences associated with offspring's adjustment to their parents' divorce. Finally, training opportunities will provide the opportunity to explore whether the family environment controls genetic expression of offspring behavior problems, use longitudinal data to study developmental changes in children's response to family conflict, and employ decision tree analyses to study how multiple risk and protective factors interact to influence child development. The proposed research seeks to move beyond simple associations between familial characteristics and outcomes and elucidate causal mechanisms by utilizing genetically informative designs, longitudinal data, and advanced quantitative methods.   n/a",Determinants of Behavior Problems after Divorce,6582861,F31MH067300,"['behavioral /social science research tag', ' behavioral genetics', ' clinical research', ' conflict', ' developmental psychology', ' divorce /separation', ' family structure /dynamics', ' functional ability', ' gene environment interaction', ' human data', ' longitudinal human study', ' parent offspring interaction', ' personality', ' predoctoral investigator', ' psychological adaptation', ' psychological stressor', ' social behavior', ' socioenvironment', ' twin /multiplet']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA CHARLOTTESVILLE,F31,2002,23885,0.02669399314594677

"Creating an artificial intelligence therapy-to-data feedback loop for child developmental healthcare Project Summary There is a sharp and increasing imbalance between the number of children with autism in need of care and the availability of specialists certified to treat the disorder in its multi-faceted manifestations. The autism community faces a dual clinical challenge: how to direct scarce specialist resources to service the diverse array of phenomes and how to monitor and validate best practices in treatment. Clinicians must now look to solutions that scale in a decentralized fashion, placing data capture, remote monitoring, and therapy increasingly into the hands of families. Using artificial intelligence (AI) and large amounts of labeled human emotion computer vision data, we have developed a solution for automatic facial expression recognition that runs on Google Glasses and Android smartphones to deliver real time social cues to individuals with autism in the child’s natural environment. We hypothesize that this informatic system can provide real-time therapy in a way that scales to meet the demand of the growing population of autism families, including underserved minorities, while growing data that can be used to measure progress over time and in the development of novel AI. Our first aim will focus on the development of a deep learning model that enables dynamic emotion recognition in the real world, and on domain adaptation procedures that enable minimal manual labeling to personalize the model for optimal accuracy on the individuals with whom the child will interact most regularly at home. Our second aim will focus on the human computer interface, namely the design of the user experience with the Android application that controls the sessions run on the Google Glass wearable. We will work our clinical colleagues and with groups of autism families to develop and enhance a set of games and activity modes that create social engagements ideal for emotion therapy, including an emotion capture and a charades game. The third aim will test our central hypothesis that the Glass system can create a therapy-to-data feedback loop that delivers clinical care while growing data for measurement and model development. We will work with up to 200 children ages 4-8 who have recent autism diagnoses and do not have access to standard behavioral therapy. We will build a community of autism families through crowdsourcing techniques, befitting the mobile paradigm embodied by our work, and through close collaboration with behavioral therapy providers, the autism outreach organization Autism Speaks, and the digital healthcare company, Cognoa. The families will work with us on design and refinement of our “Superpower Glass” system for fit, engagement, and function of use for both therapy and data capture. Importantly, we will send units home with families to use the device for at least 3 twenty-minute sessions per week for a minimum of 6 weeks. This remote period will generate a massive database to quantify overall social learning, emotion comprehension, eye contact, and sustained social acuity. In all, our work program will show that mobile wearable AI can bring the social learning process out of the clinic and into the real world for faster and more adaptive intervention. Project Narrative There is a sharp and growing imbalance between the number of clinical care providers available and the number of children with an autism diagnosis that leave most children without therapy until after critical periods in development have passed. We intend to address this problem through creation of a machine learning-enabled wearable that brings effective care to the home and empowers both parents, patients, and clinicians with mobile solutions that personalize care delivery to dramatically improve children’s outcomes. The Superpower Glass system, which delivers social cues to children during real-time interactions and provides several engagement modes for families, is a promising solution that enables greater access to care for families across the US, and potentially, across the globe.!",Creating an artificial intelligence therapy-to-data feedback loop for child developmental healthcare,9936445,R01LM013083,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Android', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Car Phone', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Child', 'Child Support', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Control Groups', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decentralization', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Expression Recognition', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Secure', 'Self-Direction', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Social Interaction', 'Socialization', 'Specialist', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'User-Computer Interface', 'Variant', 'Waiting Lists', 'Work', 'adaptive intervention', 'applied behavior analysis', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'care delivery', 'care providers', 'clinical care', 'combat', 'critical period', 'crowdsourcing', 'deep learning', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'improved', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'model development', 'novel', 'outreach', 'personalized care', 'phenome', 'practical application', 'programs', 'prototype', 'skills', 'smartphone Application', 'social', 'social engagement', 'social learning', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'underserved minority', 'user-friendly']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,664314,-0.0013471044967169423
"Using Machine Learning to Predict Clinical Deterioration in Hospitalized Children PROJECT SUMMARY Children who are admitted to the hospital and experience deterioration have a high risk of mortality and poor long-term health. Current warning early scores indicating risk of deterioration are subjectively derived and have not reduced in-hospital mortality. In recent work, I developed a vital sign based statistical model that demonstrated improved accuracy over current risk scores at predicting clinical deterioration in hospitalized children 24 hours in advance. Within adults, the combination of longitudinal data analysis techniques, machine learning, and electronic health record (EHR) data have led to highly accurate early warning scores. Therefore, my aim in this grant proposal is to utilize longitudinal integration of EHR data in a machine learning framework to develop a model for predicting clinical deterioration in hospitalized children as early as possible. I will do this by first deriving and validating a prediction model using structured EHR data collected from three pediatric hospitals (Aim 1). Using the same cohort, I will then build and validate a prediction model using features derived from unstructured clinical notes (Aim 2). I will also compare if the addition of unstructured features improves the prediction accuracy of the model derived in Aim 1. Finally, I will determine the association between non-patient level environmental variables within the hospital ecosystem and risk of clinical deterioration in hospitalized children (Aim 3). I will also determine if the addition of these environmental risk factors improves performance of the prediction model derived through Aims 1 and 2. Completion of this proposal will result in a validated pediatric risk prediction model that will enable clinicians to recognize early signs of deterioration in hospitalized children. This will facilitate timely intervention, thereby saving lives and improving long-term health. In addition, this grant will also provide me with crucial data for a future R01 trial aimed at assessing the impact of the prediction model in reducing mortality, decreasing costs, and improving long-term outcomes in hospitalized children. To establish myself as an independent investigator in pediatric prediction modeling, I propose a training plan that includes comprehensive didactics and mentorship in the areas of longitudinal data analysis, advanced machine learning, natural language processing, and concepts in pediatric care. I have assembled a first-class mentorship team comprised of national experts in longitudinal data analysis techniques and EHR-based machine learning (Robert Gibbons PhD and Matthew Churpek MD, PhD). My advisory team is comprised of experts in natural language processing (Dmitriy Dligach PhD), clinical decision support around deterioration events (Dana Edelson MD, MS and Priti Jani MD), and pediatric early warning scores (Christopher Parshuram MB., ChB., D. Phil., FRACP). By completing my research and career development goals, I will develop into an independent expert investigator in developing pediatric prediction models for ultimately improving outcomes in hospitalized children. PROJECT NARRATIVE Clinical deterioration in hospitalized children is associated with high-risk of mortality as well as complications in their long-term health. An improved prediction model capable of identifying pediatric patients at risk of clinical deterioration as early as possible can facility timely and proper intervention, thereby decreasing preventable death and improving long-term outcomes in hospitalized children.",Using Machine Learning to Predict Clinical Deterioration in Hospitalized Children,9969192,K01HL148390,"['Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Cardiopulmonary', 'Caring', 'Chicago', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Intervention', 'Ecosystem', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitalized Child', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Hylobates Genus', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurological outcome', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Randomized', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Savings', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'career development', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'control trial', 'cost', 'electronic structure', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'pediatric patients', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'preventable death', 'research and development', 'risk prediction model', 'tool', 'trend', 'unstructured data', 'ward']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,K01,2020,147563,0.07170992007727406
"Mobile bedside ultrasound for the diagnosis of pediatric pneumonia in resource limited settings Project Summary In low and middle-income countries (LMICs) pneumonia is by far the leading cause of death among children < 5 years of age. Despite progress in reducing global pneumonia deaths, pneumonia still kills over 1 million children a year. A key factor is the challenge of pneumonia diagnosis. Chest X-Ray is the gold standard for pneumonia diagnoses but exposes children to ionizing radiation and is mainly restricted to hospital settings. Outside of hospitals, pneumonia is diagnosed based on clinical grounds using the WHO’s Integrated Management of Childhood Illness algorithms. However, that approach lacks specificity, resulting in significant overdiagnosis of pneumonia. That wastes precious resources, exposes children to antibiotics unnecessarily, and delays identification of the true cause of a child’s illness. Recent years have seen an explosion of interest in bedside ultrasound as a radiation-sparing alternative to X- Ray. The accuracy of bedside US for diagnosing pneumonia is comparable to X-Ray. However, traditional bedside US suffers the same limitations as X-Rays in terms of portability, and still requires interpretation of images by a trained radiologist. Recent innovations in ultrasound technology and artificial intelligence applications suggest a possible pathway forward. Bluetooth enabled US transponders that connect to a smart phone or tablet, effectively create a truly portable US suite that can fit into one’s pocket. Similarly, advances in artificial intelligence render possible the automated interpretation of mobile bedside US (mBSUS) images on a smart phone, obviating the need for a radiologist. The twin goals of this project are: 1) to compare the accuracy of the mobile, Bluetooth US system, linked to a cell phone, against the gold standard of Chest X-Ray for diagnosis of pneumonia among children aged 1-59 months; and 2) to apply machine learning algorithms to assist in the identification of accurate classification features that reliably identify lobar pneumonia.

"Effectiveness and predictors of response for a technology-based reading intervention in the home Project Summary/Abstract. Reading Disability (RD) is the most common learning disability, affecting 10 – 15% of school age children. It incurs major functional impairments at all stages of life, with a wealth of data documenting lifelong disadvantages in educational and occupational attainment. Therefore, identifying effective and affordable treatments for RD is a high priority for reading researchers, clinicians and educators. Problematically, current evidence-based reading interventions largely rely on services by trained specialists, either in well-resourced classrooms or clinical settings. As such, under-resourced schools (or countries) often are unable to provide reading interventions for their students. In recent years, technology-based reading interventions have been proposed as a means of overcoming these challenges, as they can be administered in the home, without direct expert supervision - thereby minimizing resource demands. In the area of reading-focused EdTech, GraphoLearn has emerged as a leader, with the largest evidence-base to date. However, the vast majority of studies to date have been conducted in highly controlled settings, rather than the home environment it was intended for – leaving open questions about effectiveness. Additionally, similar to any intervention, not all children with RD benefit equally from treatment; however little attention has been given to identifying predictors of treatment response. Here we propose to evaluate the effectiveness of home-administered GraphoLearn through the implementation of a large-scale, randomized controlled trial (RCT) in 450 reading disabled children (boys and girls, ages 6.0- 10.0). To accomplish this goal rapidly and with minimal cost, we will recruit participants from the Healthy Brain Network [HBN], an ongoing study of mental health and learning disorders in children, ages 5.0-21.0, whose family have concerns about behavior and/or learning (target n = 10,000; current n = 3000+). The availability of comprehensive characterizations (e.g., demographic, cognitive, mental health, EEG, multimodal MRI) for all HBN participants makes the sample optimal for exploring an extensive set of participant and environmental factors that may affect treatment outcomes (i.e., demographic, cognitive, emotional, neurobiological, environmental). Specific aims of the proposed work are to: 1) Evaluate the effectiveness of GraphoLearn in a large sample of children with RD, and 2) Identify participant-related and environment-level factors that are significantly associated with GraphoLearn outcomes. To accomplish this latter aim, sophisticated machine learning approaches (Random Forest Regression models) will be employed. Project Narrative This project is motivated by two significant overarching problems (1) existing avenues for reading intervention in the US are not available to most children in need of help, and (2) across children there is substantial variability in pre-to-post intervention gains in reading. This project will evaluate the effectiveness of a home delivered technology-based (Edtech) reading intervention in a large and diverse sample of children, and identify factors that facilitate (or hinder) positive Edtech intervention outcomes.",Effectiveness and predictors of response for a technology-based reading intervention in the home,10058660,R01HD101842,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Control Groups', 'Country', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disabled Children', 'Disadvantaged', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Effectiveness', 'Electroencephalography', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethics', 'Family', 'Fostering', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Learning Disorders', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Matched Group', 'Mathematics', 'Mental Health', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Occupational', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Predictive Factor', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Reading Disabilities', 'Recommendation', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'School-Age Population', 'Schools', 'Services', 'Specialist', 'Students', 'Supervision', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Variant', 'Work', 'active control', 'base', 'boys', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'dosage', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'evidence base', 'functional disability', 'girls', 'intervention effect', 'language impairment', 'multimodality', 'phonology', 'post intervention', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'random forest', 'remediation', 'response', 'skills', 'sound']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,R01,2020,688574,0.05628955523767888
"A DATA SCIENCE APPROACH TO AIR TOXICS AND CHILDREN'S ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PROJECT SUMMARY: This proposal aims to characterize the associations between prenatal exposure to interpretable combinations of air toxics and children’s cognitive health through the efficient use of big public health data. With guidance from multidisciplinary advisors, the candidate will develop skills in data science, machine learning and advanced biostatistics to supplement her training in epidemiologic methods. This will allow her to progress in her career and advance research on combined environmental exposures and children’s health. Previous research has found associations between prenatal exposure to single air pollutants and children’s cognitive health but has lacked the ability to investigate combined impacts of multiple pollutants, including the synergistic/antagonistic interactions between pollutants that have been observed in experimental studies. Understanding the effects of combined exposures is a strategic goal of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, and the field of environmental health is transitioning from single-pollutant approaches to more holistic paradigms, such as the exposome. Identifying associations and interactions within the context of high-dimensional exposure data presents a computational challenge. Methods from domains such as data science, including machine learning methods, can be incorporated into the epidemiologic toolbox for addressing environmental mixtures and multiple exposures. The goal of this Career Development Award is to advance the candidate into an independent research career at the intersection of big data science and children’s environmental health. Through formal coursework, directed learning and field rotations, the candidate will gain skills in data science, machine learning and advanced biostatistics. Mentors, advisors and consultants have been selected for their complementary expertise, relevant research experience and mentoring abilities. The proposed research will leverage the skills gained from the training plan and apply them to characterize associations between prenatal exposure to interpretable combinations of air toxics and 3rd grade standardized test scores, a school-based measure of cognitive outcomes. Residence at birth will be used to link data on air toxics, a subset of air pollutants, to an administrative data linkage of public health registries and education data for approximately 220,000 children born in New York City from 1994-1998. The candidate will develop and validate a two-stage approach of hypotheses generation followed by targeted analyses in order to identify combinations of air toxics associated with children’s test scores within the context of high-dimensional exposure data (Aim 1). Targeted analyses using well-established epidemiologic methods for effect estimation and assessment of interaction between air toxics will be performed. (Aim2) Potential mediators of the relationship between air toxics and test scores can then be identified using statistical mediation and data science approaches. (Aim 3) Completion of these aims will uniquely position the candidate to conduct future research on combined environmental exposures and children’s health. PROJECT NARRATIVE Epidemiologic studies have shown that prenatal and/or early-life exposures to ambient air pollutants are associated with multiple measures of neurodevelopment and cognition in childhood. However, most of the previous studies characterized exposure using a single pollutant, even though ambient air is a complex mixture. This study will identify the combined effects of prenatal exposure to multiple air pollutants on children's standardized test scores within a large, representative population of urban children.",A DATA SCIENCE APPROACH TO AIR TOXICS AND CHILDREN'S ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH,9999949,R00ES027022,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Air Pollutants', 'Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Monitoring', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Linkages', 'Data Science', 'Databases', 'Development Plans', 'Distal', 'Education', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Information Systems', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'New York City', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Rotation', 'Schools', 'Selection Bias', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Technical Expertise', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Urban Population', 'adverse birth outcomes', 'base', 'big-data science', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'early life exposure', 'epidemiological model', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'genome wide association study', 'health data', 'high dimensionality', 'large datasets', 'machine learning method', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple data types', 'neurodevelopment', 'pollutant', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'random forest', 'research and development', 'residence', 'skills', 'third grade', 'urban children']",NIEHS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R00,2020,247463,0.04501189797897044
"Automatic Rib Fracture Detection in Pediatric Radiography to Identify Non-Accidental Trauma ABSTRACT Automatic Rib Fracture Detection in Pediatric Radiography to Identify Non-Accidental Trauma PI: Adam M. Alessio Non-accidental trauma caused by physical abuse is a leading cause of death in children in the United States. Because rib fractures are highly predictive of child abuse and chest radiographs are commonly performed for multiple indications, pediatric chest radiographs can have a critical role in the identification of abuse. Detection of rib fractures on pediatric radiographs is challenging and a high percentage of fractures are missed, particularly in imaging centers with limited pediatric radiology experience. Currently, there are no viable computer assisted strategies for rib fracture detection on chest radiographs. The purpose of this proposal is to develop machine learning methodology to detect rib fractures on pediatric radiographs using images from a network of hospitals. These methods will rely on a two-stage approach including a thoracic cavity segmentation stage followed by a fracture detection stage. We will explore two fracture detection strategies using novel supervised learning approaches: a heterogeneous U-net and a multi-modal regional-convolutional neural network. These methods will be trained and tested with a large set of fracture-absent radiographs (N=1000) from Seattle Children's Hospital and a diverse set of labelled fracture-present radiographs (N=500) from collaborating sites. These methods will be developed with an intentionally diverse set of radiographs, representative of the variety of fracture presentations and image quality in clinical practice, in order to position this rib fracture detection method for rapid translation to clinical practice. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to provide a computer assisted rib fracture assessment tool that would be a rapid and widely-available add-on to all pediatric chest radiograph exams, improving detection of rib fractures and potentially leading to improved identification of child abuse. NARRATIVE Automatic Rib Fracture Detection in Pediatric Radiography to Identify Non-Accidental Trauma PI: Adam M. Alessio Child abuse is a leading cause of death in children and rates of abuse are increasing. Detection of rib fractures on commonly performed chest radiographs has the potential to identify unsuspected child abuse, but it is very challenging to see fractures on these exams.

"Development of clinical decision tools for management of diarrhea of children in high and low resource settings Abstract Diarrheal diseases are the among the leading cause of death in children worldwide, most of which occur in low-income countries. In high-income countries, pediatric diarrhea remains a major utilization of healthcare resources. Treatment of diarrhea is mostly empiric, with antibiotic use mostly based on clinical suspicion for bacterial causes. However, the majority of cases of diarrhea do not benefit from antibiotic use, and inappropriate use leads to toxicity and resistance. Furthermore, despite the increasing availability of rapid molecular testing, there is little data to base a decision of whom or when to test. Our overarching goal is to develop and validate clinical decision tools for management of diarrheal illnesses in children of both high and low resource settings. We will utilize prospectively-collected data from two recently-completed multicenter cohort studies of pediatric diarrhea. These studies feature extensive etiologic testing, well-characterized clinical elements, and longitudinal outcome data. We have assembled a team with expertise in pediatric diarrhea, clinical prediction rules, and machine learning methods. In Aim 1, we will use domestic data to develop and validate: a) a score for bacterial etiology, and b) a score for which patients are likely to benefit from further testing. We will derive the scores using data from IMPACT, an NIH-sponsored study of 1200 children from 5 US Emergency Departments, and validate using electronic health records from the Utah Intermountain Health System. In Aim 2, we will use international data to develop and validate: a) a diagnostic score for bacterial etiology, and b) a prognostic score for risk stratification of children who go on to poor outcomes. We will derive the scores using data from GEMS, a study of over 9400 children across 7 low-resource countries, and validate using VIDA study of children in 3 African countries. Completion of the Aims will result in the availability of a number of clinical tools that healthcare workers worldwide can use for evidence-based care of children with diarrhea. Project Narrative Diarrheal diseases are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children worldwide. The management of childhood diarrhea often depend on what type of pathogen is responsible, but in many cases testing is not affordable or feasible. We propose studies to develop clinical scores to make it easier for healthcare workers to decide how to manage children with diarrhea.",Development of clinical decision tools for management of diarrhea of children in high and low resource settings,9912093,R01AI135114,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Accounting', 'Acute', 'Africa', 'African', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Antigens', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Biological Assay', 'Case Management', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Care', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cost Effective Management', 'Country', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diarrhea', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Enteral', 'Etiology', 'Feces', 'Gastroenteritis', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health Personnel', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Income', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Minority', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Diagnostic Techniques', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Pathogen detection', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Resistance', 'Resistance development', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Sample Size', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Utah', 'Vaccines', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'clinical development', 'clinical diagnostics', 'diarrheal disease', 'evidence base', 'health care service utilization', 'improved', 'low and middle-income countries', 'low income country', 'machine learning method', 'microbial', 'molecular diagnostics', 'mortality', 'outcome prediction', 'pathogen', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'tool']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2020,397159,0.1177269173877149
"The New Tics Study: A Novel Approach to Pathophysiology and Cause of Tic Disorders Project Abstract At least 20% of all children have tics at some time in their life, making tic disorders a subject of substantial public health interest. However, only about 3% of all children have tics that last for a year or more. Thus chronic tic disorders, including Tourette syndrome, can be conceptualized as a two- step process: tics start, and then they fail to remit. By the numbers, the second part of this process is the more unusual and perhaps more closely related to disease, yet surprisingly, almost no research has examined this critical period after a first tic appears but before it is clear whether the child will go on to have a chronic tic disorder. Therefore prior research that has identified abnormalities of brain structure and function in children with TS generally does not clarify whether these abnormalities are related to tic appearance or to the more important process of tic disappearance. Furthermore, tic disappearance can be observed prospectively, allowing powerful within-subject analyses to test whether features of brain structure or function shortly after tic onset predict remission of tics before TS is diagnosable, and whether such features are state-related or more durable markers of vulnerability to tics. Colleagues in the TS field have agreed that such studies would be valuable, but have suspected that recruitment would be extremely difficult. However, we have now demonstrated enrollment of subjects with New Tics (defined as beginning within the previous 6 months, median 3.6 months) at a rate of 16 subjects per year when recruitment efforts were at their peak—though still on a shoestring budget without full staffing or media advertisements. We have implemented subject preparation and quality control methods that have allowed us to acquire structural and functional MRI data of high quality in many subjects. We now propose to enroll an additional 70 subjects with New Tics and characterize them carefully at baseline and at the 1-year anniversary of tic onset (when TS can first be diagnosed). Both time points will include clinical data, structural and functional MRI, and neuropsychological measures including ability to suppress tics. We expect that complete data will be available for 55-70 subjects (including those already collected), since MRI is sensitive to movement and we are selecting for subjects with tics and additional difficulty holding still (about half of children with tics also have ADHD). We will compare baseline data from this sample to matched tic-free control subjects, and to matched subjects who already have TS or a chronic tic disorder (leveraging existing data in our laboratories to provide some of the clinical and MRI data for these groups). Analyses will include tests of specific a priori hypotheses as well as machine learning analyses of the complete dataset. These comparisons will allow us to discover whether imaging differences in children with TS are present long before TS can be diagnosed, whether they fade when tics improve, and whether they predict outcome in children with new tics. Investigation of this “pre-Tourette” population opens an entirely new window for etiologic discovery in tic disorders. It may also have important clinical consequences, if the results identify which newly- ticcing children are at highest risk for development of a chronic tic disorder. Public Health Relevance Statement At least 20% of all children have tics at some time in their life, making tic disorders a subject of substantial public health interest. In many children the tics will disappear before they've lasted as long as a year, but in others they go on to become Tourette syndrome or Chronic Tic Disorder (TS/CTD). Prior research generally has not clarified whether abnormalities of brain structure and function in children with TS/CTD are related to tic appearance or to the more important process of tic disappearance. This project will study children with recent-onset tics using clinical evaluation, MRI, and neuropsychological measures, and repeat these measures at the earliest time point that TS/CTD can be diagnosed. The results from the first assessment will be compared to results from two matching comparison groups: children with no personal or family history of tics, and children who have had tics for more than a year (Existing TS/CTD). This new approach may provide a new angle on research into Tourette syndrome, in addition to providing sorely needed information about prognosis for children who just started ticcing.",The New Tics Study: A Novel Approach to Pathophysiology and Cause of Tic Disorders,9949789,R01MH104030,"['Advertisements', 'Age', 'Anniversary', 'Appearance', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Budgets', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Family history of', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Image', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Neuropsychology', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Quality Control', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Rest', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Tic disorder', 'Time', 'brain abnormalities', 'caudate nucleus', 'comparison group', 'critical period', 'dexterity', 'follow-up', 'habit learning', 'high risk', 'improved', 'inattention', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'medical attention', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'phenomenological models', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'secondary analysis', 'support vector machine', 'tic suppression', 'vector']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,662746,0.09991584157417101
"Multisite Electronic Health Record-based Surveillance of the Burden of Diabetes by Type in Children and Adolescents Diabetes is a common chronic disease in children and adolescents under age of 18 years. In the recent two decades, both the prevalence and incidence of type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) have been increasing considerably among US children and adolescents. T2D now accounts for ~15% of diabetes cases diagnosed in childhood and adolescence. The SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth study is the only ongoing multisite surveillance study of T1D and T2D in US children and adolescents. The SEARCH study is a population-based registry, which is a more expensive, more labor-intensive, and slower surveillance method compared with a surveillance system using electronic health records (EHRs). EHR algorithms have shown great potential in identifying diabetes cases. This study will analyze both structured EHR data (e.g., diagnosis codes, medications, and laboratory results) and unstructured clinical notes. We will apply expert knowledge, machine learning, and natural language processing to develop the best algorithms for identifying prevalent and incident T1D and T2D cases. The primary objective of this study is to establish an EHR-based surveillance system for monitoring the burden of T1D and T2D in US children and adolescents. We will collaborate with 3 EHR research networks from the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network (PCORnet), covering ~3 million racially, ethnically, and socioeconomically diverse children and adolescents from 4 states (IL, LA, NY, and TX) in 3 Census regions. The patient populations in this study are roughly representative of the source populations in the catchment areas. The specific aims of this study are 1) to estimate the prevalence of T1D and T2D in US children and adolescents by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and geographic region in 2019; 2) to estimate the incidence of T1D and T2D in US children and adolescents by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and geographic region in 2019; 3) to estimate 10-year trends in the prevalence and incidence of T1D and T2D in US children and adolescents by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and geographic region, 2014-2023; and 4) to compare the prevalence and incidence of diabetes by type, as well as temporal trends, in US children and adolescents with those in children and adolescents from other countries and regions. This study is innovative because it will leverage EHRs for surveillance (more efficient and cost-effective than registries and surveys), use advanced statistical approaches (e.g., machine learning and natural language processing), estimate a denominator using patient zip codes, build flexibility into the surveillance methods according to local availability of clinical notes, and use a 2-staged sampling approach to improve chart review efficiency. All 4 states in this study do not have an active diabetes surveillance system for children and adolescents and are not covered by the SEARCH study. This study will advance our understanding of the geographic, age, sex, and racial/ethnic differences in the burden of T1D and T2D in US children and adolescents. The obtained surveillance data will help identify and prioritize subpopulations for prevention of diabetes and related comorbidities to reduce health disparities. The burden of type 1 and type 2 diabetes has been increasing considerably among US children and adolescents. A population-based registry, which is expensive and labor-intensive, has provided estimates for the prevalence and incidence of type 1 and type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents from limited geographic regions in the US. This study will build an efficient and cost-effective multisite surveillance system using electronic health records covering several other geographic regions, to estimate the prevalence, incidence, and trends of type 1 and type 2 diabetes in US children and adolescents according to age, sex, race/ethnicity, and geographic region.",Multisite Electronic Health Record-based Surveillance of the Burden of Diabetes by Type in Children and Adolescents,10085447,U18DP006503,[' '],NCCDPHP,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,U18,2020,250000,0.05190973131660306
"Validation of Physiologic CPR Quality Using NOn-inVasive Waveform Analytics (CPR-NOVA) Project Abstract  Pediatric cardiac arrest affects thousands of children each year. Progressive heart and lung failure is a predisposing cause in many of these events. Despite improvements in survival outcomes over the past two decades, more than half of these children still do not survive. As new brain injury complicates care among survivors, the burden to these children and the public's health is substantial.  Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) – the medical procedure of providing chest compressions and ventilations during cardiac arrest – saves lives, and higher quality CPR is more effective at doing so. One method to improve CPR quality is through the use of CPR quality monitoring defibrillators. By providing real- time feedback on CPR mechanics targets such as chest compression depth and rate, they represent the best patient care option currently available to improve CPR performance. Unfortunately, most of these devices are either not approved for children or use pads that are too large for many pediatric patients. Thus, current technology limits the benefit of meaningful CPR quality monitoring to a small percentage of the children who suffer a cardiac arrest. Given the strong association between pediatric CPR quality and outcomes, new methods to monitor CPR quality are urgently needed to improve the care of this vulnerable population.  Physiologic-directed CPR is a promising technique that uses the hemodynamic response of the patient to guide the ongoing resuscitation effort. This approach overcomes the technological limitations of existing CPR quality monitoring technology by using data from patient monitors. Unfortunately, because many patients do not have intra-arterial lines in place at the time of arrest to guide CPR, its clinical impact has been limited. To overcome this limitation, the objective of this ancillary application is to leverage the existing infrastructure of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development-funded Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network (CPCCRN) and the unique hemodynamic waveform database of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute-funded parent R01 – the ICU-Resuscitation (ICU-RESUS) Project – to validate two noninvasive physiologic CPR monitors applicable to nearly every pediatric cardiac arrest: 1) end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2); and 2) PhotoPlethysmoGraphy (PPG) obtained via pulse oximetry. Using sophisticated machine learning methods, a prospective observational analytic investigation is proposed with the following Aims: 1) Evaluate ETCO2 as a noninvasive CPR quality monitor among children receiving at least 1 minute of CPR in a CPCCRN intensive care unit; and 2) Using novel machine learning classification algorithms, evaluate PPG and other candidate physiologic waveforms as noninvasive CPR quality monitors.  By leveraging the substantial infrastructure of the CPCCRN, the novel hemodynamic waveform database of ICU-RESUS, and advanced machine learning analytics, this submission represents a unique opportunity to validate two noninvasive physiologic pediatric CPR quality monitors to improve clinical care and save lives. !

"An Automated Early Motor Development Risk Screener from Observational Video Recordings of Infants and Toddlers Motor development plays a pivotal role in an infant’s overall development and has a cascading effect on social, cognitive, memory, and language ability. These functions can be compromised when motor development is disrupted; motor disruption is associated with generalized developmental delays. Early screening and identification of delays can allow early interventions with the goal of not just improving motor function but overall development in other domains. Experience with independent or motorized crawling is shown to improve spatial memory in infants. Active motor training, even as early as 3 months, is shown to achieve gains in object exploration and social engagement that persist long after the training sessions, indicating the benefits of early intervention. Children who get developmental screening are more likely to be identified with delays and receive early intervention services compared to those that only receive age-appropriate milestone checks as part of pediatric well-child visits. However, comprehensive motor screening, using standardized instruments, for developmental surveillance is labor intensive and requires specialized training in administration and evaluation. Shortage of resources to perform frequent, gold-standard, comprehensive motor assessments can lead to missed opportunities for early intervention and contribute negatively to lifelong outcomes for infants at risk for behavioral and developmental disorders. In the US, 15-20% of children have a developmental or behavioral disability, but less than a third of them get diagnosed before entering school, preventing opportunities for early intervention during a critical period of brain development. In Phase I, we built a prototype Human Action Recognition Engine (HARE) to automate extraction of infant motor movement from video; then utilized this engine to demonstrate the feasibility of an automated developmental risk screener by leveraging recent advances in machine learning to achieve state of the art accuracies in assessment of infant motor development. In Phase II, we aim to build out the risk screener, SCOREIT, as a clinically deployable, cost-effective, developmental risk assessment tool to identify children who need further clinical follow-up. SCOREIT has the potential to transform early developmental screening by bringing the power of comprehensive motor screening, usually administered only to at-risk children utilizing specialized resources, to underserved and economically-fragile communities. Less than a third of US children receive developmental screening. SCOREIT can bring risk screenings to the over 70% of children that currently do not receive them, increasing opportunities for early intervention for behavioral and developmental disorders. Additionally, the HARE system’s ability to automatically extract and quantify motor movements from video can be an enabler for explorations of early markers for behavioral and developmental disorders, significantly easing manual video coding burdens and accelerating the pace of discoveries. This proposal introduces an automated, portable, low-cost developmental risk assessment tool, SCOREIT, that leverages advances in machine learning to extract motor movements from infant videos and generate a motor developmental score based on a standardized instrument (Alberta Infant Motor Scale; AIMS). SCOREIT has the potential to transform early developmental risk screening by bringing the power of standardized, comprehensive motor screening to underserved, economically-fragile communities, and increase opportunities for early intervention of developmental disorders.",An Automated Early Motor Development Risk Screener from Observational Video Recordings of Infants and Toddlers,9785611,R44HD095783,"['Address', 'Age', 'Alberta province', 'American', 'Assessment tool', 'Back', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Catalogs', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Coordination Disorders', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Evaluation', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Infant', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Occupational Therapy', 'Parents', 'Pediatrics', 'Phase', 'Physical therapy', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Questionnaires', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Screening procedure', 'Services', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Stream', 'Supination', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Video Recording', 'Visit', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cognitive performance', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'critical period', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'developmental disease', 'disability', 'early screening', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infant outcome', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'learning network', 'motor function improvement', 'portability', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'service intervention', 'social', 'social engagement', 'spatial memory', 'tool']",NICHD,"BSOLUTIONS, INC.",R44,2020,601447,0.011425353343173468
"Data-driven multidimensional modeling of nonverbal communication in typical and atypical development ABSTRACT This proposal will develop innovative technology for data-driven, multimodal characterization of nonverbal communication (NVC) in typical and atypical development. Prior research has provided qualitative descriptions of the development of children's use of gaze and gesture to regulate social interactions, but there are no objective, automated tools for measuring NVC behaviors, nor computational models to explain their coordination and timing in social interactions. This proposal will apply advanced probabilistic modeling techniques from machine learning and data mining to a rich corpus of children's behavior, including automated measures of children's posture, head pose, gaze direction, arm movements, and hand configurations derived from color and depth cameras and accelerometers. By automatically learning probabilistic latent variable models from movement data, we will obtain compact, data-driven descriptions of NVC and its coordination in children with autism, children with developmental delays without autism, and typically developing children (Aim 1). We will validate our models by demonstrating their ability to predict children's behavior, including diagnostic group and one-year language outcomes (Aim 2). We will test whether novel NVC patterns can be uncovered with bottom-up clustering of motor movement data (Aim 3). We predict our models will have greater explanatory and predictive power compared to current measures of NVC, which are typically human-coded behaviors that are descriptive, but rely on a-priori definitions of higher level behaviors. The models we develop will capture the fine-grained structure, coordination, and timing of NVC behaviors during social interactions, and thus allow us to characterize these behaviors with an unprecedented level of detail. Because interventions for young children with ASD target NVC skills, our automated measurement tools will provide clinicians with powerful new tools to assess the extent to which these treatments are efficacious. In addition, automated tools for dense measurement of fine-grained changes in NVC would enable clinicians to assess profiles of strengths and weaknesses for purposes of treatment planning, to dynamically tailor treatment to clients' changing abilities, and ultimately to accurately capture whether treatment is working. Finally, the measurement capabilities will provide researchers with a novel, cost-effective approach to analyze video recordings, at a scale that is not currently feasible due to a reliance on human coding.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) affects 1 in 68 children in the US. This project is focused on developing automated tools to characterize behaviors considered to be core, early emerging markers of autism, and that represent common treatment targets in this group. This has clear implications for identifying those at risk for autism and for ongoing clinical care.",Data-driven multidimensional modeling of nonverbal communication in typical and atypical development,9929027,R01MH114999,"['Accelerometer', 'Affect', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Child', 'Child Behavior', 'Child Development', 'Client', 'Code', 'Color', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnostic', 'Face', 'Future', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Nonverbal Communication', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Posture', 'Production', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Social Interaction', 'Statistical Models', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Video Recording', 'Visit', 'Wrist', 'arm movement', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'clinical care', 'common treatment', 'communication behavior', 'cost effective', 'data mining', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'gaze', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovative technologies', 'joint attention', 'language outcome', 'machine learning method', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'sensor', 'skills', 'social communication', 'tool', 'treatment planning']",NIMH,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2020,341605,0.001720217378158229
"Biomarker Discovery for Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease in Children Project Abstract Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is the aggressive form of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, the most common liver disease in children in the United States. The disease affects almost 1/3 of all obese children, estimated to be approximately 7 million children. Treatment is based on lifestyle changes such as a low sugar diet and increasing exercise, but no therapeutics are approved for children or adults. Currently, diagnosis of NASH requires a liver biopsy, which is cumbersome, expensive and has inherent risk. The lack of 1) non-invasive biomarkers to diagnose NASH and 2) pharmacodynamic/response biomarkers of NASH to therapy are considered by many to be an important barrier in the field. These biomarkers are needed to advance clinical care, focusing resources on the children with the most progressive form of the disease. And they are needed to drive therapeutic development because children with NASH are prioritized for participation in clinical trials and response biomarkers for NASH are needed to become surrogate endpoint biomarkers for clinical trials to accelerate drug development. This proposal represents an exceptional multidisciplinary effort to address these important gaps in knowledge. The project will be led by Dr. Miriam Vos, expert in pediatric NAFLD and experienced in early biomarker development research. Co-investigators including Dr. Kristal Maner-Smith, expert in lipidomics and Dr. Ayman Akil, expert in machine learning and biomarker discovery. The team seeks to develop a panel of biomarkers to predict NASH and to reflect response of NASH to therapy through the 2 following aims. Aim 1 will define and validate a panel of metabolites and lipids diagnostic of NASH in children. Aim 2 will define and validate a panel of metabolites, lipids and clinical variables that are associated with treatment induced improvement in NASH. Aims 1 and 2 will both capitalize on the exceptionally high-quality samples available from the NASH clinical research network and deposited within the NIDDK Central Repository. Repository serum samples are available from two pediatric clinical studies including the NAFLD Database study and the TONIC randomized clinical trial and were collected near in time to a liver biopsy as well as with detailed clinical phenotyping. Validation cohort and control samples will be drawn from the Emory Liver Biopsy Biorepository study and an ongoing Healthy Control pediatric cohort at Emory. Preliminary data demonstrates strong associations between specific metabolites and pathologic features of NASH including hepatocyte ballooning, inflammation and steatosis supporting feasibility. These studies are designed to have a sustained, powerful impact on the pediatric NASH biomarker field and to directly improve the health of children through efficient diagnosis of NASH and successful therapeutic development for NASH. Project Narrative This proposal seeks to improve child health through detecting and validating novel biomarkers for pediatric nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, the more progressive form of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.

"Longitudinal Study of Brain Imaging and Cognitive Markers of Tourette Syndrome in Children PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Chronic tic disorders (referred to here as Tourette syndrome: TS) are complex and often serious neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by motor and/or vocal tics. Tics are brief, repetitive, unwanted movements or noises, which can severely impinge upon quality of life. While TS was once thought to be relatively rare, recent epidemiological studies find that 1-6% of all children meet criteria for a chronic tic disorder, making it a significant public health problem. Typically in TS, tics begin around age 5-7 years old, peak in severity around age 10-12 years, and improve throughout adolescence into adulthood. However, not all patients show this improvement during adolescence, as ~30% continue to experience significant impairment into adulthood. Thus, the years during and immediately following peak symptom severity represent a critical time for TS, during which individuals may show considerable improvement or not. Surprisingly little research has targeted this critical developmental stage of TS. Moreover, longitudinal investigations of predictors of TS outcome have focused primarily on single variables (e.g., caudate nucleus volume or tic severity). Yet there is considerable evidence that the neurobiology of TS is quite complex, involving interactions within and between multiple brain networks. For example, our preliminary findings demonstrate stronger brain functional connectivity among cognitive control networks and motor networks, as well as altered white and gray matter volumes in prefrontal and subcortical regions in TS. Using this complex information may be more informative for understanding tic severity changes and predicting clinical outcome. We propose a longitudinal study in which we will capture the developmental stage of TS with the greatest likelihood of change in tic severity (beginning at age 10-12 years), and will follow these children to track the development of brain and cognitive features, and how they relate to symptom change, over time. To capture the complex neurobiology of TS, we will collect whole-brain resting state functional connectivity, structural MRI, cognitive, and clinical data from a group of children with TS. We will compare these children to tic-free controls (from the NIH's ABCD Study Washington University site subject pool), as comparison to typical development will be essential for interpreting longitudinal changes in TS. We will target diagnostic differences and developmental changes in specific functional brain networks, regional brain volumes, and cognitive abilities. We will also use multivariate machine learning methods to unify this rich dataset to classify and make predictions about individual children. This approach analyzes complex patterns of multidimensional data rather than single variables, providing the potential for clinical utility and to contribute converging evidence about mechanism. Identifying mechanisms underlying symptom change will provide insight into why many children with TS improve while some do not, potentially yielding new targets for treatment and predictive indicators of persistent tics. Markers of symptom improvement could be targeted to treat children who do not improve. Being able to make predictions about individual children could identify those children who need those interventions most. We have expertise with every step of the proposed study, but the application to longitudinal data over the first half of the second decade of life is novel. PROJECT NARRATIVE Children with Tourette syndrome (TS) follow varying clinical courses, as some will experience substantial improvement over the course of adolescence while others will continue to experience significant impairment. Understanding the brain and cognitive features that mediate or predict different outcomes could revolutionize prognosis and treatment. This project will study children with and without TS over time, during the key ages of 10 to 14 years, to (1) investigate how brain and cognitive markers of TS develop over adolescence and relate to changes in symptom severity, and (2) make predictions about future symptom severity for individual children.",Longitudinal Study of Brain Imaging and Cognitive Markers of Tourette Syndrome in Children,9991926,R01MH118217,"['12 year old', '7 year old', 'Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Future', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Motor Tics', 'Movement', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Tic disorder', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vocal Tics', 'Washington', 'aggressive therapy', 'base', 'brain volume', 'caudate nucleus', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'epidemiologic data', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'gray matter', 'improved', 'insight', 'longitudinal design', 'machine learning method', 'mind control', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'predict clinical outcome', 'putamen', 'symptomatic improvement', 'white matter']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,728957,0.07165123104434805
"Host Proteomic Biosignatures for a Urine-based Diagnosis of Pulmonary Tuberculosis in Children PROJECT ABSTRACT Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading cause of mortality in children worldwide. Difficulty in obtaining sputum and a low sputum bacillary load are major barriers to diagnosis, and necessitate the development of a non-sputum, biomarker-based assay for childhood intrathoracic TB disease. Host biomarker discovery for childhood TB requires a greater focus on downstream proteins and their post-translational modifications (PTMs) that are more likely to be specific to a disease phenotype and can be more easily translated into a point-of-care test. With the support of this K23 award, Dr. Devan Jaganath will identify a host proteomic biosignature in urine that can achieve the goal accuracy for a triage and/or diagnostic test for pulmonary TB in children. To complete this objective, he will leverage an ongoing prospective cohort of symptomatic children being evaluated for intrathoracic TB in Kampala, Uganda, with the extensive proteomic facilities available at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). In Aim 1, he will perform targeted mass spectrometry on urine samples from children with confirmed vs. unlikely TB, and examine the abundance and ubiquitylation of 10 host proteins that have prior evidence of specific interactions with M. tuberculosis (Mtb) proteins as candidate biomarkers. In Aim 2, he will use shotgun mass spectrometry on the urine samples to identify all host proteins and their PTMs that can differentiate TB status as novel biomarkers, and perform pathway analysis to determine the subset with functional relevance to Mtb pathogenesis. In Aim 3, he will apply machine learning analyses to identify the smallest combination of biomarkers that can achieve the target accuracy thresholds for a triage and/or diagnostic test for intrathoracic TB disease. He will then evaluate the performance of promising biosignatures in an independent, prospectively enrolled test set. Through this approach, Dr. Jaganath seeks to optimize biomarker discovery for childhood TB diagnosis by coupling prospective clinical cohorts with a targeted and untargeted high-throughput approach to comprehensively examine non-sputum samples for host biomarkers for children. Dr. Jaganath's career goal is to be a physician scientist who translates non-sputum biomarkers into clinical tools that can improve the care of children with TB. To support his path to independence, the proposed work will be paired with a dedicated, multidisciplinary mentorship team and training in international pediatric TB biomarker studies, bioinformatics for proteomic analysis, and machine learning. UCSF is an outstanding environment that is committed to junior investigators with extensive resources for research and career development, and Mulago National Referral Hospital in Uganda is a leader in pediatric TB research, and has the established infrastructure for ongoing enrollment and sample collection. The findings will support an NIH R01 application to validate the biomarkers and biosignatures in large, diverse cohorts in comparison to existing non-sputum diagnostics. Thus, the K23 award will provide Dr. Jaganath with the critical mentorship, training, resources and experience to become an independent investigator who can make important contributions to the field of childhood TB. PROJECT NARRATIVE More than half of the estimated tuberculosis (TB) disease cases in children worldwide have not been reported to the health system, and 96% of pediatric TB deaths are in children not started on treatment. The proposed project seeks to address the key barriers in diagnosing pulmonary TB in children through discovery of a host proteomic biosignature in urine. The findings will be relevant to the public health efforts to reduce the burden of TB in children and will support the development of a non-invasive, non-sputum based assay for childhood TB disease at the point-of-care.",Host Proteomic Biosignatures for a Urine-based Diagnosis of Pulmonary Tuberculosis in Children,10038668,K23HL153581,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Bedside Testings', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'California', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Child Care', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Consensus', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Sensitivity', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Hospital Referrals', 'Human', 'Immune response', 'Immunoassay', 'Infection', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Nested Case-Control Study', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary Tuberculosis', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'San Francisco', 'Scientist', 'Shotguns', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Sputum', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Triage', 'Tuberculosis', 'Uganda', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomarker panel', 'biosignature', 'candidate marker', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'disease phenotype', 'experience', 'improved', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'point of care', 'pre-clinical', 'prospective', 'protein biomarkers', 'research and development', 'sample collection', 'tool']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K23,2020,209400,0.06356185478189724
"Prenatal and Postnatal Exposure to Environmental Mixtures: Neurodevelopment and DNA Methylation Biomarkers PROJECT SUMMARY Prenatal and postnatal childhood exposure to metals, essential and non-essential, is ubiquitous via dietary and environmental sources. Heavy metals, including lead and methylmercury, are well characterized as potent neurotoxicants, associated with lower cognition and poor learning abilities. Yet, our understanding of the neurotoxicity and joint impact of many other common prenatal and postnatal metal exposures remains extremely limited. Even less is known about the combined impact of exposure to multiple metals during fetal development or postnatal exposure during early childhood, or the influence of other environmental mixtures such as nutrients, which may have shared sources, on the neurodevelopmental effects of metals. To address this significant gap, our long-term goal is to quantify the neurocognitive impact of ubiquitous prenatal and postnatal environmental mixtures and identify cord blood DNA methylation biomarkers that can reconstruct prenatal environmental exposures and predict future neurocognitive development in children. We will test if objective measures of key prenatal maternal nutrients, such as folate, vitamin B12 and essential metals attenuate or mitigate the neurotoxicity of metal mixtures. To accomplish this goal, we will leverage resources from an established U.S. pre-birth cohort, Project Viva. In this cohort, we have measured concentrations for 14 prenatal maternal metals in the first trimester of pregnancy and blood samples collected in early-childhood (~3 years) ready for metal testing as well as ready to use genome-wide cord blood DNA methylation screens. Children have been followed prospectively and undergone detail testing for neurodevelopment in early (~3 years of age) and mid-childhood (~7 years). We hypothesize that prenatal maternal 1st trimester and postnatal early childhood neurotoxic metal mixtures are associated with poor neurodevelopment in early and mid-childhood (Aim 1), and that prenatal first trimester maternal plasma folate, vitamin B12 and blood concentration of essential metals protect against prenatal metal mixture neurotoxicity (Aim 2). We also hypothesize that DNA methylation marks measured in umbilical cord blood at birth can reconstruct prenatal exposure to metals (Aim 3.a) and that cord blood DNAm marks predict future neurocognitive development in early and mid-childhood (Aim 3.b). By testing longitudinal associations in a large cohort of children with detail cognitive assessments as well as objective biomarkers of metals and nutrients, we will overcome limitations currently faced by existing studies testing few exposures simultaneously. We will use novel statistical methodology to model prenatal and postnatal environmental mixtures and machine learning algorithms to build epigenetic predictors of exposure and neurodevelopment. This research will provide a comprehensive quantification of the cognitive burden of prenatal and postnatal mixtures, the development of biomarkers of exposure and neurodevelopment and the identification of potential prenatal nutritional intervention strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Childhood decrements in neurocognitive development result in large population burden and expenditure. The proposed research will identify the extent to which prenatal and postnatal neurotoxic mixtures as well as key prenatal nutrients jointly influence neurocognitive development in childhood. This research will provide early life biomarkers that reconstruct prenatal exposures and predict childhood neurocognitive performance with the goal of developing novel and early-life interventions to protect children.",Prenatal and Postnatal Exposure to Environmental Mixtures: Neurodevelopment and DNA Methylation Biomarkers,9882859,R01ES031259,"['3 year old', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Attenuated', 'Award', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood specimen', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Child Neurotoxicity', 'Childhood', 'Cognition', 'Consequentialism', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Expenditure', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Development', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Folic Acid', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heavy Metals', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Mercury', 'Metal exposure', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Methylmercury Compounds', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurotoxins', 'Newborn Infant', 'Nutrient', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Placenta', 'Plasma', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'Vitamin B 12', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'biomarker development', 'clinical application', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive load', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'early childhood', 'exposed human population', 'genome-wide', 'in utero', 'innovation', 'learning ability', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'methylation biomarker', 'neurocognitive test', 'neurodevelopment', 'neurodevelopmental effect', 'neurotoxic', 'neurotoxicity', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'offspring', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal environmental exposure', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'prospective', 'routine screening', 'toxicant']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2020,438331,-0.01747938743782235
"Automated point-of-care identification of innocent Still's murmur in children PROJECT SUMMARY The overall goal of the proposed research and technology transfer effort is to develop a low-cost, point-of-care, mobile device-based technology for automated identification of Still's murmur, the most common innocent (benign and harmless) heart murmur of childhood. This novel technology could reduce the current rate of over half a million children unnecessarily referred to pediatric cardiologists by primary care providers each year in the United States. In Phase I, AusculTech Dx and Children's National Medical Center developed a machine-learning algorithm capable of identifying Still's murmur with high accuracy (90% sensitivity, 99% specificity). To enable digital recording, essential for computerized murmur analysis, we also developed a digital stethoscope that connects to a smartphone and is equivalent in performance to a commercial stethoscope. Our envisioned product, called StethAid, is a combination of this novel digital stethoscope and a smartphone application (app). Having successfully met the Phase I performance milestones, we now propose to fully develop StethAid and conduct a multicenter trial through the following three specific aims: (1) develop and test a clinical-grade digital stethoscope, (2) develop fully feature software app, (3) conduct a multicenter trial of automated Still's murmur identification. For the multicenter trial, we have expanded our collaboration to include Boston Children's Hospital and Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. Our deliverable for Phase II is a technology platform validated by leading pediatric cardiologists that is ready for seeking regulatory approvals, deployment at PCP offices, and commercialization. As a decision support system, StethAid could empower PCPs to identify Still's murmur accurately and thus reduce the huge number of unnecessary specialist referrals. This should save the healthcare system hundreds of millions of dollars annually, allow pediatric cardiologists to focus on patients with serious conditions, and protect healthy children and their families from the unnecessary anxiety, inconvenience, and expense of seeing a pediatric cardiologist. PROJECT NARRATIVE Over half a million children are referred unnecessarily to pediatric cardiologists by general physicians for the evaluation of Still's murmur, a normal and harmless heart murmur. This project will develop and clinically validate a novel mobile technology for automated recognition of this murmur in order to reduce the current rate of such unnecessary referrals and associated costs and inconvenience.",Automated point-of-care identification of innocent Still's murmur in children,9903425,R42HL131081,"['Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Apple', 'Benign', 'Bluetooth', 'Boston', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Congenital Heart Defects', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hearing', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart Sounds', 'Heart murmur', 'Incidence', 'Legal patent', 'Libraries', 'Medical center', 'Military Personnel', 'Modeling', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sample Size', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Specialist', 'Specificity', 'Stethoscopes', 'Technology', 'Technology Transfer', 'Testing', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'care providers', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical center', 'cloud based', 'commercialization', 'computerized', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mobile computing', 'new technology', 'novel', 'pediatric cardiologist', 'performance tests', 'point of care', 'prototype', 'smartphone Application', 'sound', 'tool', 'wasting', 'web interface']",NHLBI,"AUSCULTECH DX, LLC",R42,2020,708937,0.06816117940819842
"Computational Models for the Prediction and Prevention of Child Traumatic Stress - Resubmission - 1 Project Summary/Abstract At least 40% of children will experience a traumatic event. Of those who experience a trauma, 15-40% will develop Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and other adverse psychiatric, health, and functional outcomes (herein called Child Traumatic Stress - CTS). Despite decades of research on risk factors for CTS, the field has not arrived at specific risk factor models that can accurately predict the likelihood of CTS outcomes or identify factors that – if changed – would change their likelihood. Knowledge about changes in factors that result in changes in outcomes is, by definition, causal. The vast majority of findings in the literature on risk for CTS cannot provide such causal knowledge because such findings were based on the application of correlational methods to observational data. Experimental research cannot – for all practical purposes - be conducted for human research on risk for CTS. Thus, the field is left with correlational observational research as the near exclusive generator of empirical knowledge on risk for CTS, and such knowledge is unsuitable to guide the actions (i.e. interventions) that must be taken to change children's likelihood of acquiring CTS outcomes. We propose to address this considerable barrier to progress by applying methods that can enable confident causal inference with large observational data sets containing a broad diversity of risk variables for CTS. Machine Learning (ML) predictive and causal modeling methods will be applied to discover causal relationships among measured variables from observational data: and from such determined causal relationships, to estimate the effect on a CTS outcome when a causal variable is manipulated (i.e. intervention simulation). We will build models for outcomes associated with childhood trauma in the literature and that entail significant burden to children's well-being, functioning, and development: PTSD, Depression, Substance Abuse, Health, and Educational Performance. Project Narrative This application proposes research to apply an array of powerful and innovative computational methods – well validated in other fields – to advance the capacity to predict and prevent traumatic stress in children and adolescents. These methods will be applied to several highly relevant, existing data sets that cover diverse populations of traumatized youth and with diverse data collection designs. The data sets and the analytic methodologies have been carefully selected to advance knowledge related to prediction, discovery of causal mechanisms, and the identification of promising preventative interventions for child traumatic stress.",Computational Models for the Prediction and Prevention of Child Traumatic Stress - Resubmission - 1,10021724,R01MH119114,"['18 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Birth', 'Child', 'Child Traumatic Stress', 'Child Welfare', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Decision Trees', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Emotional', 'Ethics', 'Etiology', 'Genotype', 'Health', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Prevention', 'Randomized', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Youth', 'base', 'causal model', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'design', 'diverse data', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'functional outcomes', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'pediatric trauma', 'personalized predictions', 'predictive modeling', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'simulation', 'social', 'tool', 'trauma exposure', 'traumatic event', 'traumatic stress', 'traumatized children']",NIMH,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,613498,0.02230313118780579
"Integration of markers across physiologic, behavioral, and self-report levels at baseline and in response to treatment to characterize novel subtypes in youth with ADHD Project Summary This Mentored Patient-Oriented Career Development Award (K23) will facilitate Dr. Leikauf’s development into an independent researcher and child psychiatrist. It will provide the foundation for him to meaningfully improve strategies for cost-effective personalization of care for ADHD and related emotional disorders in diverse practice settings through a deeper understanding of the underlying phenotypic heterogeneity of these disorders. Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is highly prevalent and functionally impairing, yet phenotypically heterogeneous. Despite the complexity of the phenotype, the diagnosis is most often made using DSM-based behavioral symptom rating scales during short visits in busy pediatric settings. Additionally, current treatments are widely used but have not been demonstrated to improve functional outcomes. Currently, treatment selection involves significant trial-and-error based on caregiver’s subjective report of symptomatic improvement. Cost-effective, objective measures that would aid in personalized treatment selection and address the full range of dysfunction for children with ADHD are critically needed. The heterogeneity of the disorder has limited the development of such tools. Until now, the field has relied on subtypes that have limited validity and are based exclusively on symptom rating scales. Recent developments in our ability to collect and analyze multidimensional data for individual subjects provide a new opening for progress in this crucial area. The project will use two multi-dimensional datasets from completed clinical trials as well as generate data from a smaller, prospective study. The anticipated outcomes are as follows: 1) identification of more phenotypically homogeneous groups of children with ADHD at baseline 2) identification of more homogeneous groups based on creating a multivariate classifier informed by mechanistic response to treatment, and 3) validation of classification schema. Dr. Leikauf’s specific training goals, in collaboration with his mentorship team, include acquisition of knowledge, experience, and skills in the following areas relevant to the proposed work: 1) modern machine-learning statistical techniques that allow reliable inferences to be drawn from high dimensional data with non-linear relationships between variables; 2) mentored experience conducting a multi- method/multi-dimensional prospective study with the goal of identifying personalized therapeutic targets 3) additional translational research/clinical experience to understand what is currently known about ADHD and its relationship to cognitive dysfunction including working memory, sustained attention, and response inhibition, and 4) training in acquisition and analysis of EEG. The results should have immediate clinical impact and provide the foundation for a future prospective personalized therapeutics trial. The experiences in this proposal, if awarded, will also develop Dr. Leikauf’s abilities and thereby enable him to have a fundamental impact on mental health treatment for children and adolescents. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder affects at least 5% of children, resulting in significant psychosocial impairment and predisposing children to very high rates of later psychiatric disorders. However, current treatments do not work for all children, do little to improve long-term functional outcomes, and, in practice, are discontinued by approximately half of families within 1-3 years due to poor tolerability or perceived lack of long-term efficacy. Personalized targeting of treatments to maximize benefit and minimize harms for each individual is urgently needed but has been stymied by our limited understanding of the heterogeneous relationships between self-report, cognitive, and physiologic measures of the symptoms of the disorder; this proposal aims to use modern computational approaches to integrate information across these different measures in order to identify more homogeneous ADHD subtypes based in neurologic and cognitive deficits rather than self-report.","Integration of markers across physiologic, behavioral, and self-report levels at baseline and in response to treatment to characterize novel subtypes in youth with ADHD",10054894,K23MH121650,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Biological', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Digit structure', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Electroencephalography', 'Emotional disorder', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Harm Reduction', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge acquisition', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognition', 'Neurologic Deficit', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychiatrist', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Ritalin', 'Sampling', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Trials', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Work', 'Youth', 'atomoxetine', 'base', 'biological heterogeneity', 'cognitive testing', 'cost effective', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'disorder subtype', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'functional outcomes', 'improved', 'inattention', 'interest', 'longitudinal dataset', 'multidimensional data', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'personalized care', 'personalized diagnostics', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized strategies', 'personalized therapeutic', 'practice setting', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'psychosocial', 'recruit', 'response', 'skills', 'statistical and machine learning', 'sustained attention', 'symptomatic improvement', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'translational clinical trial', 'treatment response']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K23,2020,193536,0.029035692293176298
"Multi-Site Validation Study of the HLHS Arrest Predictor Each year in the US, there are thousands of children who are born with a severe congenital deformation, where one of the two ventricles in the heart is severely underdeveloped. If they survive infancy, these children can go on to live full and normal lives. The mortality rate for this condition is 15%, and 63% of these deaths are due to cardio-respiratory arrests. This alarming rate of arrest events persists despite vigilant ICU care with the best available intensive monitoring equipment. Our overall goal is to improve current patient monitoring systems by developing machine learning algorithms that can predict the onset of an arrest event, hours before it occurs. This early warning indication can be provided to nurses and doctors who can intervene to prevent these life-threatening events from occurring, improving outcomes for these critically ill children. Preliminary studies at Texas Children's Hospital have resulted in a computer algorithm that can estimate the odds of arrest in single ventricle children, 1-2 hours prior to overt symptoms. The algorithm is based on a logistic regression risk model, and was developed using over 55,000 hours of vital sign observations. The specific aims of the proposed research are: (1) To test the hypothesis that this computer algorithm can provide an early warning of arrest, with sufficient accuracy for clinical use across different clinical centers; (2) To understand the relationship between the risk score provided by this algorithm and other post- surgical complications that commonly occur in these children during the their hospitalization. Aim 1 is a multi-center study of this algorithm on a large, prospective, and independent cohort, in order to measure its true predictive performance. Performance metrics to be measured will be the ROC area and positive and negative likelihood ratios. This will help us determine the optimal threshold for the detection of an arrest event. Aims 2 focus on relating the risk of arrest to outcomes such as mechanical circulatory support, re-operation, arrhythmia, and necrotizing enterocolitis. Successful completion of these aims will result in the first clinically validated, real- time early warning system for anticipating acute arrest events in children with single ventricle physiology. The techniques and technologies developed in this work are immediately translatable to other diseases and conditions for both adults and children. Thousands of children each year are born in the US with only a single functional ventricle, putting them at substantial risk of acute cardiac arrest and ultimately death. This project will validate a new monitoring technology, developed at Texas Children's Hospital, which can predict the onset of arrest 1-2 hours before it occurs in this population. This technology will provide nurses and doctors the valuable time that they need to mitigate problems leading up to arrest before these problems become life threatening, improving the chance of survival for these critically ill children.",Multi-Site Validation Study of the HLHS Arrest Predictor,9996775,R01HL142994,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Behavior', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Colorado', 'Common Ventricle', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computers', 'Critically ill children', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Equipment', 'Event', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Heart Arrest', 'Heart Ventricle', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Infant', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lung', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Necrotizing Enterocolitis', 'Nurses', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Palliative Surgery', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Monitoring System', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatric cardiology', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Surgical complication', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'base', 'care providers', 'clinical center', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'infancy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'news', 'operation', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'repaired', 'respiratory', 'validation studies']",NHLBI,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,574855,0.1279776550593257
"Identifying Coronavirus B-cell Epitopes Associated with COVID-19 Illness Severity Identifying Coronavirus B-cell Epitopes Associated with COVID-19 Infection and Illness The new coronavirus outbreak that begin in December 2019 has created a global public health emergency. This has led to an intense search to identify factors that contribute to the susceptibility and severity of illness. We recently developed an array to identify antibody-binding epitopes for rhinoviruses. Data from these arrays can be combined with information about viral protein structure to identify highly immunogenic regions for respiratory viruses. We propose to expand this array to include linear epitopes that represent the entire proteome of SARS- CoV-2 and all other common coronaviruses that infect humans (OC43, NL63, etc.). The study population will include children from the COAST, WISC and URECA birth cohort studies who are also participating in the HEROS SARS-CoV-2 surveillance study. As part of routine cohort activities, these children undergo serial sampling of blood and nasal secretions that we can analyze using the array to determine individual patterns of antiviral antibody epitope recognition. We hypothesize that the pattern and quantity of antibody specific for epitopes of common coronaviruses contributes to the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and illness. We propose three specific aims that will utilize sera obtained from children before and after HEROS-confirmed infection with SARS-CoV-2. First, in specimens obtained pre-infection we will use the array to identify patterns of antibody epitope recognition to common childhood coronaviruses, assess cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV-2, and determine whether cross-reactivity is associated with protection against infection or illness. In the second aim, we will determine whether the diversity of antibody responses to common respiratory viruses is associated with a reduced risk of infection or illness. Finally, in the third aim we will describe antibody binding patterns before and after known COVID-19 cases to identify candidate regions that are immunogenic and neutralizing. To accomplish this aim, we will perform micro-neutralization assays (available in the BSL3 laboratory of Dr. Kristen Bernard, UW Madison) on convalescent sera or nasal secretions from children who developed symptomatic infection. This information will be analyzed together with pre- and post-infection array data using machine learning approaches to identify neutralizing epitopes. Identifying patterns of serologic responses that are cross- protective could help to identify susceptible individuals in the population and direct the design of vaccines to current and future viruses. PROJECT NARRATIVE (from parent grant) The morbidity and cost to society from childhood viral respiratory illnesses (VRI) is staggering, and allergic respiratory disease is rampant. In the search for prevention for these common and high-burden diseases, perhaps the solutions are on the farm. Our main hypothesis is that microbes in farming environments promote immune development in early life, and thereby reduce the severity of VRI and protect against allergies. We will test this hypothesis by expanding studies in the Wisconsin Infant Study Cohort (WISC), a birth cohort in dairy farm country consisting of children and their families who were enrolled before birth and then monitored for farm exposures, development of the immune system, respiratory illnesses and allergies. We hope to identify farm-related exposures, including microbes, that promote healthy immune development, and ultimately, healthy children. Completion of these studies will lead to development of new strategies for raising children who get fewer respiratory illnesses and avoid developing respiratory allergies.",Identifying Coronavirus B-cell Epitopes Associated with COVID-19 Illness Severity,10170660,U19AI104317,"['2019-nCoV', 'Allergic', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Diversity', 'Antibody Response', 'Asthma', 'B cell repertoire', 'B-Lymphocyte Epitopes', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Birth', 'Blood specimen', 'COVID-19', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cohort Studies', 'Common Epitope', 'Coronavirus', 'Country', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Enrollment', 'Epitopes', 'Family', 'Farming environment', 'Future', 'Human', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Microbe', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nose', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Proteome', 'Rhinovirus', 'Serological', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Societies', 'Specimen', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Vaccine Design', 'Viral', 'Viral Antibodies', 'Viral Structural Proteins', 'Virus', 'Wisconsin', 'burden of illness', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cross reactivity', 'immunogenic', 'infection risk', 'new technology', 'novel coronavirus', 'parent grant', 'public health emergency', 'respiratory', 'respiratory virus', 'response', 'study population', 'surveillance study']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,U19,2020,406048,0.04220990040133625
"Decoding the neural time-course of spoken word recognition Project Summary  Word recognition is crucial not only for comprehending spoken language but for mapping spoken words onto text in reading. Individuals with language and reading deficits (e.g., Specific Language Impairment, Dyslexia, Autism, which together affect up to 16% of children) have been shown to have deficits in word recognition, making it crucial to understand this process. A hallmark of word recognition is that listeners activate neural representations of multiple candidate words that are consistent with the early acoustic input, and these candidates compete for recognition as they unfold in real-time.  The overall goal of this proposal is to capitalize on recent developments in multivariate and machine- learning techniques for analyzing signals obtained from the human brain to measure the real-time unfolding of spoken word recognition. Although these techniques have been most widely used with fMRI data, we propose to extend them to EEG data because EEG is easily used with children and clinical populations, and provides access to the time-course of word recognition, thereby revealing underlying cognitive mechanisms of word recognition, such as lexical competition. Our preliminary findings using this EEG-based paradigm have demonstrated that we can decode the recognition of a specific word (among a set of 8-12 alternatives) at each msec time-step after stimulus onset. The method is sensitive to partial activation of competing words that share some phonological features with the target word, thereby revealing the dynamics of lexical competition as the word-recognition system settles on the final target.  Our objectives are to conduct a series of small-scale experiments that achieve three aims. First, we develop and optimize the method with adults (e.g., the experimental procedure and computational implementation). Second, we validate the method with adults by measuring its test/re-test reliability, comparing its estimates of word recognition with traditional behavioral paradigms, and examining how lexical status, and semantic and orthographic expectations shape lexical competition revealed by the EEG measure. This will yield a new, non-invasive, and highly reliable method suitable for assessing spoken word recognition in adults, children, and special populations. Third, we will preliminarily extend the method to children to pave the way for future developmental studies. Taken together, accomplishing these three aims would provide an innovative and powerful tool for assessing a crucial component of language processing in a wide variety of typical and atypical populations. Project Narrative The proposed research will impact public health by establishing a new EEG-based paradigm for understanding how listeners recognize spoken words. Word recognition is crucial not only for comprehending spoken language but for mapping spoken words onto text in reading. Individuals with language and reading deficits (e.g., Specific Language Impairment, Dyslexia, Autism, which together affect up to 16% of children) have been shown to have deficits in word recognition, making it crucial to understand this process. A hallmark of word recognition is that listeners activate neural representations of multiple candidate words that are consistent with the early acoustic input, and these candidates compete for recognition as they unfold in real-time. Our project will develop and optimize a new method in which machine learning tools are used to decode EEG-based neural signals to characterize the time-course of competition.

"The role of the oral microbiome in disparities in dental caries and responsiveness to caries prevention Project Summary This project proposes to leverage innovative data collected as part of a large, ongoing, cluster randomized trial of therapies to arrest and prevent dental caries in low-income, minority children to (1) investigate the potential microbial determinants of oral health inequities across racial/ethnic children and (2) explore the degree of susceptibility and responsiveness to conventional therapeutic interventions for caries. Over the past ten years, we have conducted multiple studies on the effectiveness and feasibility of preventive treatments for dental caries applied in pragmatic settings across the United States. In each study, an average of 30% of children was observed to have untreated decay at baseline, a prevalence which was consistently higher amongst minority children. Following receipt of therapeutic interventions for caries prevention and observed longitudinally, some children stayed caries free (responders) while others experienced new incidence of tooth decay (non-responders). This phenomenon of resistance and susceptibility to caries occurred in children with or without prior caries experience, was found amongst children living in both fluoridated and non-fluoridated communities, and was not related to sex or age. In total, re-occurrence of dental caries following preventive therapies was observed in approximately 15% of children regardless of prior caries. Our intention is to study these phenomena. We propose to collect new data from the oral microbiome in a cohort of children receiving biannual silver diamine fluoride (SDF) for dental caries, as well as data on key confounders including dietary intake and oral hygiene behavior. This new data will be linked to data collected from clinical examinations and participant demographics. Children identified for this study will be participants in the referenced clinical trial. Uncovering the role of the microbiome in health disparities could enhance our understanding of why some populations have poorer success rates, greater severity of disease, or overall elevated disease risks compared to others. Our primary goals are to (1) utilize microbiome sequence analysis and taxonomic assignment to identify the potential microbiota and metabolites of caries that exist within different racial/ethnic groups with and without untreated caries, (2) compare the distribution of these microbiota prior to and following receipt of silver diamine fluoride to arrest and prevent caries, and (3) develop a predictive model of responsiveness to SDF using artificial neural networks and LASSO/elastic nets. This will be the first study to longitudinally examine the microbial determinants of innate caries susceptibility and resistance to traditional preventive therapies. Results may improve the precision, targeting, and impact of caries prevention programs. Project Narrative This project focuses on (1) the microbiota determinants of oral health inequities in US children and (2) the degree of susceptibility and responsiveness to conventional therapeutic interventions to arrest and prevent dental caries. Using data from an ongoing, large scale, cluster randomized trial of preventive therapies for caries, we will collect additional data from the oral microbiome to explore disparities in untreated caries across racial/ethnic groups, compare the distribution of relevant microbiota and their metabolites in children with and without caries before and after receipt of silver diamine fluoride, and generate a predictive model to predict whether children are more or less susceptible to the effects of traditional preventive therapies. Together this research will improve the precision, targeting, and anticipated impact of caries prevention programs.",The role of the oral microbiome in disparities in dental caries and responsiveness to caries prevention,10241702,R56DE028933,"['Aftercare', 'Age', 'Asians', 'Bacterial Genes', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Biota', 'Caries prevention', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Dental Hygiene', 'Dental caries', 'Development', 'Diamines', 'Diet', 'Dietary intake', 'Disease', 'Eating', 'Effectiveness', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Fluorides', 'Gender', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Hispanics', 'Hygiene', 'Incidence', 'Indigenous', 'Individual', 'Intention', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Minority', 'Oral health', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Phylogeny', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention program', 'Prevention trial', 'Preventive', 'Preventive therapy', 'Preventive treatment', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Saliva', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Severity of illness', 'Silver', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Therapy trial', 'United States', 'Water fluoridation', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'clinical examination', 'cohort', 'demographics', 'disorder risk', 'early childhood', 'experience', 'health disparity', 'health equity', 'improved', 'innovation', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'microbiota metabolites', 'minority children', 'neural network', 'oral microbial community', 'oral microbiome', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'racial and ethnic', 'recruit', 'responders and non-responders', 'sex', 'success', 'support vector machine', 'traditional therapy']",NIDCR,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R56,2020,517296,0.10215437348708054
"Development and Validation of an Automated Measurement of Child Screen Media Use: FLASH The obesity field is fraught with problems of measuring people's diet, physical activity and sedentary behaviors that are hindering the advancement of the field to find promising solutions for obesity prevention and treatment. An important example is screen media use, a prominent cause for sedentary time that has been linked to obesity and metabolic syndrome, as well as other unwanted physiologic, psychosocial, and academic outcomes in children. Given the important impact screen use has on children's health, our ability to measure the time children spend on screens is very limited. Current assessments typically rely either on (1) general questions estimating “typical use;” or self- or parent-report via screen use diaries, both which have reporting bias and recall bias; or (2) devises initially intended to restrict children's TV viewing (TV Allowance™), which may have intervention effects or miss-classify TV viewing time. While automatic and objective measures of physical activity have shown validity and reliability for quantifying children's physical activity, no system that is automatic, accurate and unobtrusive has been developed to assess children's screen use on different platforms. Advances in technology, such as person detection, accurate facial recognition based on images, and imaging, computer vision and signal processing algorithms now offer novel and promising solutions to objectively and automatically measure people's screen viewing behaviors. We will leverage these recent advances and integrate them to develop a first of its kind, in-home, unobtrusive, automatic, privacy preserving screen use monitoring system: Family Level Assessment of Screen use in the Home (FLASH) that uses an embedded computing platform connected to a video camera on larger, stationary screens (FLASH-TV); or functions as a background app using a front facing camera (FLASH-Mobile). Our trans-disciplinary group, consisting of behavioral researchers at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) and electrical engineers at Rice University, propose to develop and asses the validity of the FLASH to accurately identify whether and for how long a child is using screen media devices. In this multiple-PI application, the development of FLASH is led by engineers at Rice. Once a final system has been developed, alpha and beta tested, a validation study will take place in observation labs by the BCM behavioral researchers with 6-10 year old children for FLASH-TV and FLASH-Mobile (n=43). Comparisons of FLASH output will be made to staff observations of children participating in a set of structured predefined activities. Next FLASH will be assessed for feasibility and accuracy for identifying children's screen use across platforms in a naturalistic home setting (n=46), compared to direct observation and screen use diaries. This project has the potential of creating a paradigm shift in scientist's ability to assess the role screen use has on health outcomes or intervention effects of screen media reduction programs, similar to that of accelerometers for physical activity research. FLASH has the potential of having a significant impact on public health and clinical research regarding screen media use.   PROJECT NARRATIVE Higher levels of screen media use have been associated with obesity, metabolic syndrome and other unwanted health and psychosocial outcomes in children. Despite the recent attention screen use has received among public health and clinical circles, the measurement of screen use behaviors is very crude and inaccurate. In this application, we propose to develop and assess the validity of an in-home objective, unobtrusive, automatic, privacy preserving screen use monitoring system, called FLASH that has the potential to revolutionize the measurement of screen use behaviors.",Development and Validation of an Automated Measurement of Child Screen Media Use: FLASH,9906897,R01DK113269,"['10 year old', 'Accelerometer', 'Algorithms', 'Asses', 'Attention', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Child Health', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Data Reporting', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diet', 'Documentation', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Engineering', 'Face', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Privacy', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Rice', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Structure', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Video Recording', 'Weight', 'Youth', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'behavioral outcome', 'college', 'computational platform', 'cost', 'diaries', 'field study', 'gaze', 'handheld mobile device', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'intervention effect', 'monitoring device', 'novel', 'obesity development', 'obesity in children', 'obesity prevention', 'obesity treatment', 'privacy preservation', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'sedentary', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'signal processing', 'tv watching', 'validation studies']",NIDDK,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,505658,0.06252639336634973
"Neural mechanisms of successful intervention in children with dyslexia Reading instruction prompts the emergence of neural circuits that are specialized for rapidly translating printed symbols into sound and meaning. Understanding how these circuits differ in children with dyslexia, and change with learning, is an important scientific challenge that holds practical implications for education. The proposed research employs longitudinal measurements in children with dyslexia over the course of a highly effective intervention program to: (a) determine how brain structure and function change in response to reading instruction; and (b) investigate neurobiological factors that predispose a child to struggle or succeed in the intervention. Thus, this proposal seeks to determine both how education shapes brain development, and how a child’s unique neurobiology predicts educational outcomes. Aim 1) White matter plasticity and learning – White matter was previously considered static infrastructure; it is now known that many cellular properties of the white matter change with learning. Reading interventions provide a powerful tool to study experience-dependent plasticity in the human brain. Based on novel quantitative MRI and diffusion MRI measurements developed by the PI and collaborators, it is now possible to quantify changes in cell density, intra-axonal water and myelination at millimeter resolution. Longitudinal measurements collected before, during, and after the intervention will be used to model the time-course of white matter plasticity associated with improvements in reading skills, and investigate the biological mechanisms that underlie differences in learning among children. Aim 2) Bottom-up and top-down computations in the reading circuit - When our eyes fixate upon a word, a cascade of neural processes is initiated, beginning in the visual system and progressing through a series of computations that translate the visual representation into sound and meaning. We have developed the first model of the neural computations performed by critical components of the brain’s reading circuitry. Based on this new understanding of computations in the literate adult brain, we will investigate how computations differ in children with dyslexia, and change in response to reading instruction. Aim 3) Neural biomarkers of learning outcomes - Even in a controlled and intensive learning environment, some children show substantial improvements in reading skill, while others show limited change. What biological factors predispose a child to excel or struggle when provided a high-quality intervention? Pre- intervention MRI measurements will be examined as predictor variables for individual differences in intervention learning rate, and long-term, post-intervention outcomes. Aim 3 will capitalize machine learning to develop a model of the neuroanatomical factors that predict learning outcomes. Dyslexia, an impairment in accurate or fluent word recognition, is the most common learning disability affecting roughly ten percent of children. This proposal capitalizes on cutting edge neuroimaging methods, in combination with carefully controlled educational interventions and behavioral measurements, to generate a new understanding of how successful intervention shapes the development of the brain circuits that support skilled reading. A deeper understanding of the mechanisms of successful remediation of dyslexia, and individual differences in learning, will pave the way for personalized approaches to dyslexia treatment.",Neural mechanisms of successful intervention in children with dyslexia,10013256,R01HD095861,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Caliber', 'Cell Density', 'Child', 'Computer Models', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dyslexia', 'Education', 'Educational Intervention', 'Eye', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual Differences', 'Infrastructure', 'Instruction', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Myelin Sheath', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurons', 'Orthography', 'Outcome', 'Predictive Factor', 'Predisposing Factor', 'Process', 'Property', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual system structure', 'Water', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'brain remodeling', 'brain shape', 'cognitive task', 'density', 'educational atmosphere', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'intervention program', 'learning outcome', 'literate', 'millimeter', 'mouse model', 'myelination', 'neural circuit', 'neural model', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'phonology', 'post intervention', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'remediation', 'response', 'skills', 'sound', 'successful intervention', 'tool', 'white matter', 'white matter change']",NICHD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,531494,0.048915136864047803
"Development of a novel mobile health tool for age-specific dehydration assessment and management in patients with diarrheal disease Project Summary Diarrheal diseases lead to an estimated 2.4 billion episodes of illness and 1.3 million deaths each year, with the majority of those deaths occurring in adults, adolescents, and children over five years. As the severity of diarrheal diseases can vary widely, accurately assessing dehydration status remains the most crucial step in preventing morbidity and mortality. While patients with severe dehydration require hospital admission and immediate resuscitation with intravenous fluids to prevent hemodynamic compromise, organ ischemia, and death, those with mild to moderate dehydration can be treated in outpatient settings with relatively inexpensive oral rehydration solution. Yet, while several tools have been validated for use in children under five years of age, no clinical diagnostic tool has ever been validated for the assessment of dehydration severity in adults, adolescents or children over five years of age with acute diarrhea. Differences in both adult physiology and diarrhea etiology may compromise the accuracy of clinical diagnostic models developed for use in young children. The proposed research will derive the very first age-specific clinical diagnostic models created for the assessment of dehydration status in patients over five years of age with acute diarrhea, incorporate those models into a new mobile health (mHealth) tool, and validate the performance of this tool in a new population of patients with acute diarrhea. To accomplish this task, we will enroll a prospective cohort of adults and children over five years of age with acute diarrhea presenting to the rehydration unit of the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b) in Dhaka, Bangladesh and collect data on presenting clinical signs and symptoms shown to correlate with dehydration severity in prior studies. We will then employ machine learning techniques to derive age-specific clinical diagnostic models for assessing dehydration in patients over five years of age with acute diarrhea. We will conduct formative research among clinicians working at icddr,b to develop an innovative mobile phone based platform which will incorporate these new age-specific diagnostic models for rapid use by frontline health workers. Finally, we will validate both the accuracy and reliability of the newly developed mHealth tool in a new population of adults and children over five years of age with acute diarrhea. Once developed and properly validated, this novel mHealth tool has the potential to help physicians, nurses, and other healthcare providers more accurately diagnose dehydration severity and better determine the optimal management strategy for patients with acute diarrhea. Improved diagnostic approaches may in turn be shown to reduce both the morbidity and mortality that occurs as a result of missed diagnoses of dehydration, as well as the adverse events and inappropriate utilization of limited healthcare resources that can result from inaccurate diagnoses of dehydration. Project Narrative Dehydration due to diarrheal diseases remains a leading cause of death in both children and adults worldwide, yet no clinical tools have ever been validated for the assessment of dehydration severity in adults or children over five years of age with acute diarrhea. The proposed research will both develop and validate an innovative new mobile phone based platform for the assessment of dehydration severity in adults, adolescents, and older children with acute diarrhea. This new mobile health tool will help physicians, nurses, and other providers worldwide to determine the best management strategies for patients with acute diarrhea, potentially improving and rationalizing care for the hundreds of millions of patients each year presenting to healthcare facilities around the world with acute diarrhea.",Development of a novel mobile health tool for age-specific dehydration assessment and management in patients with diarrheal disease,9969419,R01DK116163,"['5 year old', 'Acute Diarrhea', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Bangladesh', 'Beds', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Car Phone', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cost Savings', 'Data', 'Dehydration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diarrhea', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Future', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'IV Fluid', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'International Unit', 'Ischemia', 'Lead', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nurses', 'Oral', 'Organ', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Prospective cohort', 'Provider', 'Rehydration Solutions', 'Rehydrations', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Severities', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'accurate diagnosis', 'age group', 'base', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical examination', 'clinical predictors', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'diarrheal disease', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'international center', 'low and middle-income countries', 'mHealth', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'prevent', 'success', 'tool', 'usability']",NIDDK,RHODE ISLAND HOSPITAL,R01,2020,618136,0.03703644271110692
"A study of antibiotics usage on early gut microbiome colonization and establishment in young children PROJECT SUMMARY The emergence and transmission of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is currently one of the most critical public health threats. As such there is an urgent need to identify new ways to reduce AMR transmission. In recent years, several studies have started to reveal the complex relations and interactions between antibiotics, antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) and the human microbiome. The human microbiome plays profound roles in responding to antibiotic treatment and the transmission of ARGs. The altered microbiome, especially in children, may have a distinct resistome (the entire ARGs in the microbiome community). Infants and young children receive frequent antimicrobial courses for common respiratory infections and are thought to spread ARGs effectively in the community. Otitis media is the most common reason for antimicrobial treatment in children. The antibiotic treatment that is selected for use in young children may significantly influence AMR spread in the communities. To date, there are a limited number of prospective, controlled comparative studies on how selected antibiotics affect the development of antibiotic resistance in the microbiome in young children. It is not possible to investigate children in an experimental way and expose them to antibiotics without an indication for the treatment. Non-severe acute otitis media, however, is an excellent clinical model to investigate the impact of different antimicrobial agents, since clinical guidelines suggest several alternative approaches to treat children, including watchful waiting without antibiotics. In this study, we will investigate the impact of the most commonly used antibiotics on the intestinal microbiome, and in particular the resistome in children with otitis media. The Oulu University study is IRB approved and has started enrolling infants and young children with non-severe otitis media in a study cohort and plan to finish the enrollment within the first few months of this project. Children are randomly allocated in four antibiotic treatment groups to compare the impact of amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, azithromycin, or no treatment on the intestinal microbiome and ARGs. We will solicit the antibiotic exposure during lifetime and collect stool samples before (day 0) and three days after the antibiotic course (day 10). We will apply quantitative PCR, 16S rDNA and metagenomic sequencing on different platforms to characterize the microbiome and resistome over time. De novo genome assembly based on Oxford Nanopore long reads technology, combined with high depth Illumina sequencing will reveal the details of ARGs and gene variants between species, and between microbiome communities, and show us novel mobile elements containing ARGs, which may be potentially transferred horizontally between species. We will apply machine learning approaches to quantitatively study how each bacterial species responds to and survives under antibiotic exposure, by analyzing genomic variants in ARGs, changes in three dimensional structure of the key ARGs, ARG network and pathways. PROJECT NARRATIVE Antibiotic resistant bacteria are a growing threat for public health. This proposal involves a randomized, controlled study of how the human microbiome in young children responds to different antimicrobial agents and will reveal possible genomic mechanisms by which this occurs thereby providing insight into potential new approaches to address the emergence of antibiotic resistant bacteria.",A study of antibiotics usage on early gut microbiome colonization and establishment in young children,9958698,R21AI151730,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Amoxicillin', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Azithromycin', 'Bacterial Antibiotic Resistance', 'Child', 'Clavulanate', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Comparative Study', 'Complex', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Enrollment', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Infant', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intestines', 'Invaded', 'Machine Learning', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Otitis Media', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient observation', 'Pattern', 'Plasmids', 'Play', 'Preventive measure', 'Primary Health Care', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Recombinant DNA', 'Respiratory Tract Infections', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Universities', 'antimicrobial', 'antimicrobial drug', 'base', 'beta-Lactams', 'clinical care', 'colonization resistance', 'design', 'emerging antimicrobial resistance', 'fecal microbiome', 'genetic variant', 'gut colonization', 'gut microbiome', 'insight', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbiome', 'microbiome alteration', 'microbiome research', 'nanopore', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'randomized controlled study', 'recruit', 'resistance gene', 'stool sample', 'three dimensional structure', 'transmission process', 'treatment arm', 'treatment choice', 'treatment group']",NIAID,"J.

"Predicting Heterogeneous Neurodevelopmental Outcomes in School-age Children with Early Caregiving Adversities Project Summary Children with severe Early Caregiving Adversities (ECAs) are the most vulnerable to psychopathology as a result of prolonged neglect, abuse, and care disruptions that impact neurodevelopment. It is currently estimated that addressing ECAs would lead to a 29.8% reduction in worldwide psychiatric illness. Existing research, including findings from the original grant of this renewal, has demonstrated that there is a very strong link between ECA exposures and increased risk for psychopathology and altered neurodevelopment at the population level; and yet, given the heterogeneity in ECA populations, there is a critical gap in knowledge regarding how ECAs increase any specific risks to an individual child. The proposed research addresses this significant mental health problem by combining sophisitcated data-analysis methods that use experiential and phenotypic heterogeneity together with longitudinal neuroimaging and behavioral assessments in school-age children. This approach will increase precision when linking ECAs and child outcomes associated with the Research Domain Criteria constructs of Negative Valence and Cognitive Control Systems (NVS/CCS). The overarching goal of the present work is to create an explanatory model for the heterogeneous impact of ECAs on neurodevelopmental trajectories of NVS/CCS. This project's premise is that children exposed to ECAs have highly heterogeneous developmental histories as well as heterogeneous outcomes; therefore, prediction of ECA outcomes requires cutting-edge, sophisticated data analytic methods. We hypothesize that data-driven approaches will 1) more precisely define NVS/CCS outcomes for school-aged children with ECAs, and 2) provide a more robust explanatory model for links between ECAs and NVS/CCS trajectories. Aim 1A subtypes children with a history of ECAs based on 2.5-year developmental trajectories of NVS/CCS. 300 6-8 year old children (250 sampled from previous institutional and foster care; 50 community comparisons) will provide neuroimaging, behavioral, and self/caregiver reports every 15 months for 2.5 years. Biclustering methods will be applied to the baseline and follow-up data to identify homogeneous NVS/CCS final outcome clusters of children. Aim 1B develops an explanatory model to predict developmental trajectory subtypes for children with ECAs, from early life profiles and brain/behavior phenotypes at the time of enrollment. Machine learning methods applied to early life profiles, baseline NVS/CCS profiles, and sex, will predict developmental trajectory subtypes. Aim 2 identifies adverse and protective life events during the 2.5-year assessment period that are predictive of 2.5-year follow-up outcomes for children with ECAs. The inclusion of child-sex and current life- events will identify potential divergence in pathways across middle childhood. This prospective design of children exposed to various ECAs is designed to develop predictive models for ECA trajectory subtypes and outcomes, which can inform our understanding of risk and protective factors in accord with the goals of precision medicine.   Project Narrative Children with severe Early Caregiving Adversities (ECAs) are the most vulnerable to psychopathology, and it is estimated that addressing ECAs would lead to a 29.8% reduction in worldwide psychiatric illness. Existing research has demonstrated that there is a very strong link between ECA exposures and increased risk for psychopathology and altered neurodevelopment at the population level; and yet, given the heterogeneity in ECA populations, there is a critical gap in knowledge regarding how ECAs increase any specific risks to an individual child. The proposed research addresses this significant mental health problem by combining longitudinal multimodal brain imaging and high- dimensional behavioral assessments in school-age children together with sophisticated data analytic techniques to increase precision when linking heterogeneous ECAs and child outcome with the goal of predicting mental health outcomes and identifying children who would benefit most from specific early interventions.  ",Predicting Heterogeneous Neurodevelopmental Outcomes in School-age Children with Early Caregiving Adversities,9964904,R01MH091864,"['10 year old', '8 year old', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Catalogs', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Child Rearing', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Communities', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Decision Trees', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Grouping', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Nature', 'Negative Valence', 'Orphanages', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathway interactions', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Psychopathology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'School-Age Population', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Work', 'abuse neglect', 'analytical method', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'brain behavior', 'caregiving', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive control', 'computerized', 'design', 'follow-up', 'foster care', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'middle childhood', 'multimodality', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'outcome prediction', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prepuberty', 'prospective', 'protective factors', 'resilience', 'sex', 'socioeconomics', 'violence exposure']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R01,2020,698273,0.10922623473364844
"THE PRETERM BEHAVIORAL PHENOTYPE: TRAJECTORIES OF PSYCHOPATHOLOGY & CHANGES IN CEREBRAL CONNECTIVITY PROJECT SUMMARY: Children born prematurely are at elevated risk for psychiatric disorders, including ADHD, autism and anxiety. Indeed, the ‘preterm behavioral phenotype’ is comprised of inattention, anxiety and social- communication impairments. This constellation of comorbid disorders persists across the lifespan, accounting for long-term impairment and diminished quality of life among very preterm (VPT; born ≤32 weeks gestation) children, a population at high risk for altered brain development. Yet, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the increased prevalence of these symptoms remain undetermined. Further, VPT children face high exposure rates to deleterious psychosocial risk factors which have similarly been linked to adverse psychiatric outcomes and changes in brain development. We posit that decreased connectivity and the resulting diminished developmental trajectories within and across key functional networks (e.g., default mode, frontoparietal control and cingulo-opercular networks) and related white matter tracts (e.g., cingulum, corpus callosum and uncinate) underlie comorbid preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms that persist or worsen at age 9-10. This process begins during infancy and extends to middle childhood, with psychosocial risk playing an important modifying role. Advances in MRI methodology now enable characterization of structural and functional brain networks with unparalleled spatial and temporal resolution. Here, we couple these highly innovative, state-of-the-art MRI techniques with detailed psychiatric assessments to study our unique, sociodemographically-diverse longitudinal cohort of VPT and term-born children (N=302) with high rates of psychosocial adversity now reaching age 9-10. The cohort has been followed since birth, including prospective collection of high-quality neonatal functional and structural connectivity MRI data and longitudinal assessments of preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms and psychosocial and familial factors at ages 2 and 5, with >80% cohort retention to date at both assessment waves. Continued evaluation of this enriched cohort provides an opportunity to determine: 1) trajectories of preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms to define early indicators of later impairment enabling targeted interventions, 2) relationships between neonatal and age 9-10 functional and structural connectivity and these deficits, and 3) the modifying role of psychosocial adversity. Application of cutting-edge MRI acquisition and analysis methods, including machine learning approaches, enables unprecedented characterization of the effects of VPT birth on connectivity in the developing brain. We will extend these methods to delineate relationships between imaging measures and preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms, improving understanding of modifiable effects of early life exposures and psychosocial risk on psychiatric outcomes. These data are critical for developing individual- level neuroimaging, behavioral and psychosocial presymptomatic predictive models for adverse mental health outcomes, measures necessary to inform and evaluate treatments applicable during sensitive developmental periods which mitigate risks of psychopathology associated with prematurity and psychosocial adversity. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH This study is designed to improve our understanding of the changes in brain structure and function that underlie the elevated rates of inattention, anxiety and autism spectrum symptoms now increasingly recognized in prematurely-born children. Using cutting-edge magnetic resonance imaging methods, we will investigate these relationships in a unique, longitudinally-studied cohort of very preterm and term-born children with high rates of psychosocial adversity now reaching age 9-10 years and previously studied using neuroimaging during infancy and detailed assessments of psychiatric symptoms during early childhood. The overarching goal is development of new approaches for earlier, more accurate identification of children at risk for these disorders, enabling progress toward targeted interventions which improve outcomes by limiting risks for psychopathology associated with prematurity and psychosocial adversity.",THE PRETERM BEHAVIORAL PHENOTYPE: TRAJECTORIES OF PSYCHOPATHOLOGY & CHANGES IN CEREBRAL CONNECTIVITY,9967154,R01MH113570,"['Accounting', 'Age', 'Anisotropy', 'Anxiety', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Cerebrum', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Effect', 'Collection', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neonatal', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pattern', 'Perinatal', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Infant', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Survival Rate', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'associated symptom', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'connectome', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'early childhood', 'early life exposure', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'inattention', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'middle childhood', 'neonatal magnetic resonance imaging', 'neonate', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'premature', 'prospective', 'psychiatric disability', 'psychiatric symptom', 'psychosocial', 'sex', 'social', 'social communication', 'social communication impairment', 'sociodemographics', 'targeted treatment', 'temporal measurement', 'white matter']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,614537,0.02504731526375336
"Neural mechanisms of risk and resilience in early childhood irritability PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Irritability, defined as lowered threshold for anger when experiencing the RDoC construct frustrative non-reward, i.e., failing to receive expected rewards, is one of the most common reasons for pediatric psychiatric evaluation. Our work shows that early detection is critical: If irritability in preschool-age (3-6 years, before 1st grade) continues into school-age (after 1st grade), as it does for approximately 50% of preschool-age irritable children, such persistent irritability puts children on the path to mental disorder across the lifespan. Thus, identifying the neural mechanisms by which children persist vs. remit in irritability is paramount to intervene in the earliest phase of the clinical cascade. Irritability is linked with abnormalities in reward processing, which may lead to greater frustration when rewards are not received. Such reward processing vulnerabilities may be ameliorated by better inhibitory control, which normatively increases with maturation. However, the interplay between reward processing and inhibition in irritability trajectories is unknown. Investigating longitudinal changes in neural circuitry during this developmental period is important because the reward- and inhibition-related neural networks undergo substantial change and may be most malleable to early intervention. Our overall goal is to identify reward- and inhibition-related neural pathways that characterize persistence vs. remission of early childhood irritability. To this end, the proposed project will longitudinally characterize the neural and symptom trajectories of preschool-age children into school-age. We will collect measures of reward- and inhibitory control-related brain function at baseline and 24-month follow-up from 215 5-6-year-old children prior to 1st grade, alongside assessments of child irritability and inhibition at each 6-month follow-up. A comprehensive assessment of child (cognition, temperament, psychopathology), parent (psychopathology) and contextual factors (e.g., parenting, stressors) will also be assessed at baseline and 24-month assessments. Our central hypothesis is that young children with reward- and inhibition-related neural deficits are more likely to persist in irritability compared to those who remit. Specific aims are to identify (1) concurrent contributions of reward- and inhibition-related neural function to irritability at each age (preschool-age, school-age); (2) developmental changes in reward- and inhibition-related neural mechanisms of irritability trajectories from early to middle childhood; (3) early childhood reward- and inhibition-related neural predictors of irritability trajectories and future psychopathology; and (4) the moderating role of child sex, parent psychopathology, parenting, and life stress on these brain-behavior associations. This proposal will advance the field by revealing the neural circuitry of irritability risk and resilience. Innovative aspects include focusing on a key age range (5-6 years) to prevent later disorders, multiple time point imaging, and machine learning methodology. Our project is significant because it will pave the way for precision medicine for irritability: providing the right treatment (based on neural mechanisms) to the right people (children who will persist in irritability), at the right time (preschool age, before irritability problems worsen). PROJECT NARRATIVE Because preschool-age irritability that persists into school-age predicts lifespan mental disorder and poorer functional outcomes, identifying the neural mechanisms by which children persist vs. remit in irritability is paramount to intervene in the earliest phase of the clinical cascade. Our overall goal is to identify reward- and inhibition-related neural pathways that characterize persistence vs. remission of early childhood irritability and may be targets for future novel preventive efforts. Our project is significant because it will pave the way for precision medicine for irritability: providing the right treatment (based on neural mechanisms) to the right people (children who will persist in irritability), at the right time (preschool age, before irritability problems worsen).",Neural mechanisms of risk and resilience in early childhood irritability,10051164,R01MH121385,"['5 year old', '6 year old', 'Accounting', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anger', 'Anxiety', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Child Rearing', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Frustration', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Internet', 'Interview', 'Lead', 'Life Stress', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Neural Inhibition', 'Neural Pathways', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Nursery Schools', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preventive', 'Psychopathology', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'School-Age Population', 'Schools', 'Services', 'Sex Ratio', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'Temperament', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'age related', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'contextual factors', 'early childhood', 'experience', 'financial incentive', 'first grade', 'follow-up', 'functional outcomes', 'innovation', 'middle childhood', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'reward processing', 'sex', 'socioeconomics', 'stressor', 'support network']",NIMH,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,759490,0.037794709505068726
"Effect of complex mixtures on oxidative stress and cognition in children ABSTRACT In many areas of the world, children are regularly exposed to environmental chemicals. During any given period of life, children will experience exposure to many chemicals at the same time. The effects of such mixtures of chemicals on the molecular underpinnings of the disease process, such as oxidative stress (OS) or on functional endpoints such as cognitive functions, are not well understood in children. There is also little understating of the extent to which endogenous antioxidant defenses in children's bodies or exogenous antioxidants buffer the effects of chemical mixtures on children's health. The few studies on this topic to date have been mostly cross-sectional or limited to small numbers of chemicals. To address these gaps, the proposed study will leverage the Salud Ambiental Montevideo (SAM) cohort in Uruguay, which has enrolled 679 1st-grade children between years 2012-19. Currently, children range in age 7-15 years and have been followed-up for 0-5 years, depending on year of enrollment. Exposure to chlorpyrifos and pyrethroids pesticides has been characterized in a sub-sample of children using urinary metabolites of the pesticides. Exposure to metals in this cohort is generally low. In a cross-sectional pilot study of SAM participants, a metal mixture was linked to higher levels of oxidative DNA damage and with lower performance on a test of general cognitive abilities. The proposed study will consist of 3 years of follow-up of SAM children to annually characterize the levels of metals in blood and urine, and metabolites of chlorpyrifos, pyrethroids, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in urine. Each year, urinary biomarkers of OS (F2-isoprostane and 8-OHdG), serum antioxidant enzymes (GPx and PON1), and serum antioxidant vitamins (vitamin C, carotenoids, retinol, etc). will be measured. A sub-sample of ~100 children will participate in a year-long intensive (monthly) assessment of OS biomarkers to characterize short-term fluctuations in biomarkers and their biological predictors. Children will complete assessments of executive functions (EF) in Y2 and Y3 of the study. Leveraging data collected at enrollment into SAM (T0, ~7y), chemical mixtures will be constructed in statistical machine learning models for four time points: T0 and Y1-3 of the proposed study. These mixtures will be modeled to understand how exposure to mixtures over time is associated with OS and EF. Potential effect modification by antioxidants will be tested. The proposed activities align with the 2018-23 NIEHS strategic plan of research on the exposome to promote human health through the advancement of environmental health sciences. Specifically, they will: 1) advance the basic understanding of short (1 yr) and medium-term (3 yrs) fluctuations in biomarkers of OS and antioxidant defenses, which have not been investigated in children; 2) contribute to understanding of the extent to which chemical mixtures in early-middle childhood affect a molecular process (OS) thought to underlie the development of chronic disease, as well as functional endpoints that underlie children's learning and social interactions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Throughout their lives, children are exposed to many different chemicals but our understanding of the effects of these mixtures on child health is limited. Our research is relevant to public health: it will inform prevention efforts and communication of risks by creating a deeper understanding of how exposure to chemical mixtures affects oxidative stress and cognition in children and how well the body's antioxidant defenses are able to counteract these effects. Our work is also relevant to the mission of the NIEHS: it will contribute fundamental knowledge on environmental influences on disease.",Effect of complex mixtures on oxidative stress and cognition in children,10072546,R01ES031411,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'All-Trans-Retinol', 'Antioxidants', 'Area', 'Aromatic Polycyclic Hydrocarbons', 'Arylesterase', 'Ascorbic Acid', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Buffers', 'Carotenoids', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Chlorpyrifos', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cognition', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'F2-Isoprostanes', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Human', 'Income', 'Infrastructure', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Mediation', 'Memory', 'Metal exposure', 'Metals', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Neurocognitive', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Participant', 'Performance', 'Pesticides', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Serum', 'Social Interaction', 'Strategic Planning', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tocopherols', 'Urine', 'Uruguay', 'Vitamins', 'Work', 'aged', 'antioxidant enzyme', 'aryldialkylphosphatase', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive performance', 'cohort', 'early adolescence', 'environmental chemical', 'enzyme activity', 'executive function', 'experience', 'first grade', 'follow-up', 'glutathione peroxidase', 'improved functioning', 'individual variation', 'middle childhood', 'oxidative DNA damage', 'pyrethroid', 'response', 'sample collection', 'sex', 'statistical and machine learning', 'success', 'urinary']",NIEHS,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,R01,2020,580988,0.11345703432271438
"Novel Accelerometer Calibration and Validation in Children andAdolescents Summary Accelerometers have been embraced by the scientific community as valid and reliable physical activity (PA) assessment tools. This is especially true in some sub-populations, such as children, who lack the ability to self- report their behaviors. Tremendous progress has been made in the objective assessment of PA and sedentary behavior (SB). Several measurement challenges remain that limit our ability to identify; dose-response associations with disease and risk factors, prevalence and determinants of these important health behaviors, changes in behavior due to time and intervention efforts. To overcome these challenges, we propose novel calibration procedures that will leverage the richness of three axes of raw acceleration data during free-living calibration activities, from wrist- and hip-worn accelerometers. Consistent with current PA recommendations for youth, the proposed study will focus on calibrating and validating accelerometer output to quantify intensity and duration of PA and identifying specific predominant modes of activity (e.g., sedentary time, locomotion, and fine/gross motor activity). Our primary goal is to follow best-practices data collection and analysis procedures to develop a comprehensive set of accelerometer algorithms that will accurately and precisely estimate minutes of various intensities of PA and mode of activity from hip- and wrist-worn accelerometers in children and adolescents (18 months to 21 years old), using video recorded direct observation during free-living activities as the criterion measure. Narrative Accurate and precise estimates of physical activity, sedentary behavior, and patterns of those behaviors in youth are essential in order to identify changes in those behaviors and to inform related policy decisions. The proposed research will extend previous accelerometer calibration studies by videotaping free-living activities in a large sample across a wide age range of children and adolescents. The raw acceleration signals from both hip- and wrist-worn devices will be analyzed using linear regression and machine learning methods to generate a family of freely available algorithms that produce accurate and precise estimates, reducing inconsistencies and confusion on use of previous accelerometer cutpoints in youth.",Novel Accelerometer Calibration and Validation in Children andAdolescents,9938564,R01DK110148,"['21 year old', 'Acceleration', 'Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavior', 'Calibration', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Confusion', 'Controlled Environment', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Family', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Health behavior change', 'Hip region structure', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Linear Regressions', 'Locomotion', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Output', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Physical assessment', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Videotape', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'Youth', 'actigraphy', 'age group', 'base', 'behavior change', 'computerized data processing', 'disorder risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'response', 'sedentary', 'sedentary lifestyle']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST,R01,2020,355478,0.06274023999338837
"Novel Wearable and Wireless Scratch Sensor as a Drug Discovery Tool Itch leads to serious impairment of quality of life—often times on par with pain. Itch is the hallmark symptom and primary driver of morbidity for atopic dermatitis (AD)—one of the most common inflammatory skin diseases affecting 24 million adults and 10 million children in the U.S. Currently, there is a severe lack of objective measurement of itch. Psychometric surveys are point measurements that lack sensitivity and validity—particularly in children. Measuring itch-related scratching behavior offers a potential objective way to measure itch. Unfortunately, wrist strapped electronics fail to capture scratch accurately and are not adapted for children. This project seeks to accelerate the full qualification of a novel, wearable sensor leveraging a machine learning algorithm to objectively and accurately measure scratching. We propose to address key comments from the FDA in our accepted letter of intent (DDT COA #000120) by accomplishing the following specific aims. Aim 1: we will augment our current scratch sensor to achieve 7-day battery life on a single wireless charge (current battery life: 24 hours) to increase adherence and reduce user burden. Aim 2: we propose to extend healthy normal testing to strengthen our predictive algorithm and train against additional cofounders with an additional 8 subjects (n=16 total). In addition, we will improve the usability and cybersecurity of our software and cloud system. Aim 3: we will extend our existing clinical study at Northwestern University to include more pediatric and adult individuals with AD (n=30 target total). Psychometric surveys will assess user/caregiver experience afterwards, and determine which features of the sensor have greatest value to patients. Success will be defined by successful submission of a full qualification plan to the FDA within 12 months as a fully accepted drug discovery tool. The long- term goal is to make this scratch sensor widely available to support drug development by providing an objective endpoint for itch, and inform future clinical care of treatment response in a patient’s naturalistic environment. Further applications include deployment in other itchy conditions (e.g. prurigo nodularis, chronic pruritus of the elderly, pruritus associated with renal or hepatic failure). Itch is a profoundly disturbing symptom that greatly reduces quality of life. For Atopic dermatitis (eczema) sufferers, a disease that afflicts 10% of children and 4% of adults in the U.S., itch is the greatest source of morbidity. However, there remains a lack of objective, repeatable measurement tools for itch hindering drug development. Measuring scratch behavior offers one opportunity to quantify itch. This project will support efforts to fully qualify an accepted letter of intent for a novel wearable scratch sensor as a drug development tool (COA# 0001120).",Novel Wearable and Wireless Scratch Sensor as a Drug Discovery Tool,10146184,U01FD007001,[' '],FDA,"SONICA, LLC",U01,2020,249103,0.005553705929503958
"Using Real-world Data to Assess the Burden of Diabetes in Children and Adolescents in Florida ABSTRACT Strong evidence suggests an increasing trend of diabetes onset for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes (T1DM & T2DM) among children and adolescent in the United State (US) and globally since 2000. Significant racial- ethnic and geographic disparities have also been documented in diabetes incidence and in access to care and metabolic control in this vulnerable population. These alarming observations call for a timely surveillance system for the onset of diabetes among children and adolescents, so that tailored public health programs can be developed and health care resources can be efficiently allocated to address the needs of these vulnerable groups in a timely manner. However, diabetes surveillance studies on this particular population are limited in the US. The primary source for current prevalence and incidence estimates of diabetes among children and adolescents in the US for the CDC is from the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth (SEARCH) study, which relies on an active case reporting system from enrolled clinical centers over ten states. The SEARCH study is important, however, does not include the majority of the population located at the south-east region, where diabetes prevalence was found to be the highest in the country among the adult population (i.e., the “diabetes belt”). Less is known if the prevalence and incidence of diabetes among children and adolescents in this area, including Florida, are also the highest in the country. In this proposed study, we will build a surveillance system in Florida to monitor the prevalence and incidence of diabetes among children and adolescents in an accurate, cost-effective, and timely fashion. As the 3rd-most populous state in the United States with a high level of racial-ethnical and geographic diversities, Florida will serve as an essential piece for the national diabetes surveillance system and provide important data to study the diabetes epidemiology among children and adolescents in the south-east region of the US where diabetes was found the most prevalent in the country. We will leverage our unique real-world data (RWD) source, the OneFlorida network, a large state-wide repository of RWD that contains linked EHRs, claims, vital statistics, and birth records data, covering more than 60% of Floridians across all 67 Florida counties to build this diabetes surveillance system. In particular, we will combine the structured and unstructured data (e.g., physician’s notes) from patients EHRs to develop novel data-driven computable phenotyping (CP) algorithms through modern machine learning methods, so that our estimations on the prevalence and incidence of T1DM and T2DM will be more accurate than prior EHRs-based systems. This study will also generate important data to study the social and behavioral determinants of health among many other potential contributing factors that results in ethnic-racial and geographic disparities of the diabetes, at both individual (e.g., individual health behaviors) and contextual levels (e.g., area-level access to metabolic control programs). PROJECT NARRATIVE Diabetes data and surveillance studies among children and adolescents are significantly limited in the United State, especially in the south-east region, where diabetes was found to be the most prevalent.

"Parsing early emerging heterogeneity related to autism spectrum disorder A major impediment to early identification and intervention for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is our limited understanding of how different children present signs as toddlers, including what risk symptoms coincide across multiple dimensions to predict outcome. Our objectives are to quantify behavioral and brain connectivity based subtypes of risk that model the variability of ASD symptom expression in a community sample of toddlers. We will then test the predictive validity of this approach in the same cohort of children at three years of age in order to identify risk profiles that differentially predict later cognitive, behavioral, and clinical features. First, we will implement two unsupervised data-driven computational approaches in a community sample of 3000 children between 18-24 months old in order to characterize clusters of risk profiles. We hypothesize that each approach will identify a proportion of high-risk individuals consistent with epidemiological estimates of ASD and associated developmental disabilities (e.g., language or global DD). Based on our preliminary data, we anticipate that ~300 children will be identified by these data-driven risk-profiling methods. We also hypothesize that distinct patterns of structural and functional connectivity will distinguish groups of at-risk children and that these groups will differ from low-risk children. All children will be scanned with the same brain imaging sequences and procedures implemented in the Baby Connectome Project and will be compared to data from 100 low-risk children from that project. Our neuroimaging sample of 300 children will be reassessed at age three with direct clinical assessment using gold-standard diagnostic instruments as well as parent report. This will allow us to validate the risk profiling approach implemented at 18-24 months, to compare with a current screening approach, and to refine the risk profiling approach with supervised training of prediction algorithms that incorporates behavioral/clinical outcome data. We expect this method for risk stratification/subtyping to better model the heterogeneity inherent to the early at-risk and resilient phenotypes, which will subsequently improve early identification/diagnosis efforts. These outcomes will have translational impact because improved methods for early identification in ASD are necessary for the successful development of efficacious, personalized early interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Symptoms of autism present differently in toddlers, which makes it difficult to identify children at risk during their first two years of life. Our goal is to measure variation in behavior and brain functioning in this age that may predict differing clinical outcomes. Identifying different subtypes of risk will later help us develop individually-optimized clinical recommendations for children with autism and related disorders.",Parsing early emerging heterogeneity related to autism spectrum disorder,9881344,R01MH115046,"['3 year old', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Disabilities', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Life', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Stratification', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Toddler', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'case control', 'case-based', 'clinically actionable', 'cohort', 'communication behavior', 'connectome', 'design', 'early screening', 'follow up assessment', 'high risk', 'improved', 'instrument', 'learning algorithm', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome prediction', 'population based', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive test', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'repetitive behavior', 'screening', 'social communication', 'symptomatology', 'translational impact', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2020,782692,-0.0488415215981188
"Anatomic biomarkers of chronic kidney disease progression among children Progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in childhood is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, metabolic bone disease, and death. Congenital abnormalities of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT), including posterior urethral valves, account for 50-60% of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in children and are the most common cause of ESRD in this age group. In children with CAKUT, kidney injury is often already established at birth due to renal dysplasia. Some children, however, maintain preserved kidney function into adulthood while others progress to ESRD in childhood. Our ability to effectively implement therapies to slow CKD progression is limited by our lack of understanding of which patients are at greatest risk for CKD progression and therefore would be most likely to benefit from early intervention. Thus there is a need for biomarkers that can identify children with CAKUT early in life who are at high risk of future CKD progression. To identify children with CAKUT early in life who are at high risk of future CKD progression, we will develop novel computational methods to derive clinically informative biomarkers from ultrasound (US) imaging data using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and effectively integrate them with established clinical measures for early prediction of CKD progression. To achieve reliable and accurate kidney segmentation, Aim 1 develops an automatic kidney segmentation method by adopting fully CNNs, conditional random fields, and active contour models to simultaneously learn informative high-level image features and inter-voxel relationship under shape regularizations to improve the segmentation accuracy and robustness to imaging noise. To achieve improved prediction of CDK progression based on US imaging data, deep CNNs will be adopted to learn informative imaging features in a multi-instance learning framework to predict which children with CAKUT will develop CKD progression and their timing of progression in Aim 2. These techniques will be applied to a dataset of patients followed at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, in order to derive individualized predictive indices of CKD progression. The proposed new techniques will allow us to early differentiate patients with distinct disease progression patterns.

"Towards noninvasive diagnosis of malaria PROJECT SUMMARY Plasmodium falciparum causes the deadliest form of malaria, which is responsible for nearly one million deaths annually. There is currently no perfect test to detect if a person has malaria. This is because all available tests have challenges and are all based on testing a blood sample. We have identified volatile organic compounds that are produced by the malaria parasite in culture. In a recent pilot study that was conducted in Lilongwe, Ma- lawi, we found that similar compounds are also present in the breath of children who have uncomplicated falci- parum malaria. We also observed a global change in the breath profile of children with malaria. The objectives of this proposal are to identify candidate biomarkers of malaria, with the long-term goal to develop a new non- invasive test to diagnose clinical malaria infection. Supported by our strong preliminary data that indicate that this strategy will be successful, our objectives will be met through two specific aims: 1) determine reproducible changes in the breath composition in response to malaria infection, in an independent location. 2) Relate breath changes with parasite development stages. Our approach is innovative, since we will enroll naturally infected children in the field. Children harbor the highest parasite and gametocyte densities. The proposed re- search is significant, because we will progress in development of new, much-needed malaria diagnostic tool that will not rely on blood samples.

"Multiplexed Antigen-Specific Antibody Fc Profiling on a Chip for Point-of-Care Diagnosis of TB in HIV-infected Children Abstract: Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading cause of death in children, with an estimated 1 million children affected, and more than 200,000 deaths in children yearly due to TB. HIV coinfection has been estimated to contribute to more than 35% of TB-related deaths in children in Africa, making the collision of the HIV and TB epidemics one of the most lethal to date. Both HIV infection as well as HIV-exposure in utero, among HIV-exposed but uninfected (HEU) children, have been linked to higher risks for the development of TB among young children. Failures to prevent TB disease and devastation has been attributed to the lack of an effective vaccine as well as our inability to diagnose children under the age of 5 due to the difficulty in obtaining sputum and the paucibacillary nature of the disease in young children. Thus, an inexpensive biomarker-based diagnostic test tailored for pediatric TB using non-sputum samples that could be used at the point of care in resource-limited settings could profoundly improve TB treatment and prevent deaths in children, especially in those under 5 years of age. While Mtb-specific antibody titer-based diagnostics have performed poorly in the past, due to the inability of accurately distinguishing between active TB disease from latent TB infection (LTBI), recent data from our group has shown that Mtb-specific antibody glycosylation shifts significantly across disease states. Moreover, this antigen-specific antibody glycosylation approach reliably classifies individuals into active and latent disease states across HIV infection status, across geographies and can even distinguish recent Typhoid infection among children in endemic areas. Based on these observations, a simple binding-based assay was developed that can rapidly, sensitively, and specifically detect changes in Mtb-specific antibody glycosylation from a small sample volume offering an opportunity for the first time to develop an antigen-specific antibody glycosylation diagnostic for pediatric TB from a microliter-scale sample. Given that HIV+, HEU, or unexposed children may target distinct Mtb antigens, here we have assembled a multi-disciplinary team and program termed FASTER-Kids (Fc Antibody Signatures for TubERculosis in children) that will: 1) Define the landscape of Mtb-specific antibody glycosylation responses that distinguish children with TB, 2) Develop a point-of-care test that will rapidly capture these specific antibody responses and glycosylation changes from microliters of blood. Ultimately, this collaborative structure will enable the iterative improvement and development of this simple, rapid, inexpensive diagnostic to manage TB infection in young children. Based on accumulating data pointing to highly significant shifts in TB-specific antibody glycosylation across latent and active TB disease, the goal of this proposal is to develop an inexpensive, simple, reliable TB-specific antibody-based point-of-care diagnostic to manage TB disease in children under the age of 5.",Multiplexed Antigen-Specific Antibody Fc Profiling on a Chip for Point-of-Care Diagnosis of TB in HIV-infected Children,9986268,R01AI152158,"['5 year old', 'Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Age', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Antibody titer measurement', 'Antigen Targeting', 'Antigens', 'Area', 'Bedside Testings', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Drops', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemic', 'Exposure to', 'Failure', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV/TB', 'Immunologist', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Nature', 'Polysaccharides', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Pulmonary Tuberculosis', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serologic tests', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'South Africa', 'Specificity', 'Sputum', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Tuberculosis', 'Typhoid Fever', 'Vaccines', 'base', 'co-infection', 'cohort', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'glycosylation', 'high risk', 'improved', 'microchip', 'miniaturize', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pediatrician', 'point of care', 'point-of-care diagnostics', 'prenatal exposure', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'response', 'sensor', 'tuberculosis treatment']",NIAID,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,974009,-0.018516524055972195
"A Computational Biomechanical Airway Model for Obese Children at Risk for OSAS ABSTRACT Childhood obesity remains epidemic and is most prevalent in minorities. Obese children have a higher risk for developing obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) with an estimated prevalence of 50%, compared to the general pediatric population with a known prevalence of 2-4%. OSAS carries with it significant neurocognitive, cardiovascular, and metabolic derangements. Additionally, obese children do not respond well to treatment such as adenotonsillectomy or weight loss with residual OSAS exceeding 50%. Despite progress that has been made in recent years to understand the anatomical and functional attributes of OSAS in children, the precise mechanism leading to the disorder remains unknown in the majority of obese children, hindering the development of efficacious treatments. Thus, the overarching goal of this study is to implement state-of-the-art dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and image analytics using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and biomechanical modeling, to establish the biomechanical basis that leads to OSAS or protects from it, in naïve and treated children with obesity. NARRATIVE Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is a common and difficult to treat disorder in obese children and leads to significant medical consequences. We still do not understand why some obese children suffer from this disorder while other do not. The current study will use advance imaging analytical tools combined with biomechanical models to better understand the causes of the disorder and ways to improve outcomes of treatment in these children.",A Computational Biomechanical Airway Model for Obese Children at Risk for OSAS,9947999,R01HL130468,"['17 year old', '3-Dimensional', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Biomechanics', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body mass index', 'Breathing', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Computer Models', 'Continuous Positive Airway Pressure', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dilator', 'Disease', 'Drops', 'Epidemic', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intercept', 'Intervention', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Muscle', 'Nasopharynx', 'Neurocognitive', 'Obesity', 'Object Attachment', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Oropharyngeal', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Property', 'ROC Curve', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Sleep', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tonsil', 'Treatment outcome', 'analytical tool', 'automated segmentation', 'awake', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'cardiometabolism', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved outcome', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'longitudinal design', 'non rapid eye movement', 'novel', 'obesity in children', 'pharyngeal critical pressure', 'pressure', 'respiratory', 'response', 'standard care', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,740371,0.09895461521146323
"Development and Evaluation of an Evidence-Based Mobile Health Caregiver Intervention for FASD Project Summary/Abstract   Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) represent a major public health problem that affects up to 2 to 5  percent of school-­aged children in the US. Unfortunately, only a small fraction of children with FASD and their  families can access FASD-­informed interventions due to significant systems-­ and family-­level barriers.  Research suggests that self-­directed and peer-­to-­peer interventions are acceptable to families and can lead to  significant improvements in parenting, child behavior, and resource utilization. Advancements in technology  are facilitating more accessible and interactive methods for self-­directed education and support. The proposed

provide caregivers with evidence-­based content and peer-­moderated support they can easily access and use  to improve outcomes for their children and families. The app, currently called “FMF Connect,” will be derived  from the scientifically-­validated Families Moving Forward (FMF) Program and will build on existing frameworks  for the development of medical apps. This project will follow a systematic approach to the development and

FASD. Implementation data will aid in identifying the patterns of app usage that relate to the greatest  improvements in child and caregiver outcomes. Study hypotheses are: 1) that caregivers will find the FMF  Connect intervention acceptable, with easy to access content and encouraging support from peer-­moderators;;  2) that greater usage of specific intervention components will relate to larger improvements in child and  caregiver outcomes;; 3) that caregivers who receive the FMF Connect intervention will have larger gains on  child and caregiver outcomes relative to a waitlist comparison group;; and 4) that an increase in  neurodevelopmental attributions for behavior will mediate intervention-­related improvements in parenting  efficacy and child behavior. Project findings will guide further app development both in terms of content and

"Innovative Method for Real-time Assessment of Intracranial Compliance ""Standard of care"" neurological monitoring for patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) - a leading cause of death and long-term neurological impairment in children and adults-has not changed in decades, relying mainly on intracranial pressure {ICP) monitoring. Remarkably, the use of ICP alone as a therapeutic target for severe TBI is currently controversial due to a lack of robust supporting evidence, especially for its use in children. To address this clinical need, we developed the ICP-PC02 Compliance Index (ICP-PCI), an algorithm to compute dynamic intracranial compliance in real-time by integrating continuous ICP and end tidal CO, (ETC02) data streams. Bedside assessment of intracranial compliance-the relationship between changes in ICP and concomitant changes in intracranial volume, has been limited because of the lack of point-of-care devices to measure cerebral blood flow (CBF)/cerebral blood volume (CBV). The ICP-PCI is based on the well-known and robust relationship between the partial pressure of CO2 in blood (PC02) and CBV, where a change in PC02 of 1 mmHg induces an -3% change in CBF in patients with severe TBI. Since CBF is proportional to blood vessel radius to the fourth power, changes in CBF reflect immediate changes in CBV. As continuous ICP and ETC02 monitoring are standard of care for patients with severe TBI, ICP-PCI can be determined using existing ICU monitoring. To date we have obtained preliminary data in children with severe TBI in an IRB approved study that validates the physiologic premise and demonstrates feasibility for measurement of ICPPCI using existing, continuous ICU monitoring deemed guidelines-based standard of care. In this proposal, dense time series data, including continuous ETC02, ICP, and other physiologic waveforms will be interrogated. ICP-PCI will be calculated as the running moment-to-moment correlation between ETC02 and ICP across optimized temporal epochs, and subject to additional signal processing. We will confirm our findings across a larger cohort and define the temporal pattern of ICP-PCI and associations with relevant clinical variables: ICP, CPP, duration of ICP monitoring, medical and surgical interventions, and ICU and hospital length of stay. In addition, high-density, time series data will be integrated and time-synchronized with electronic health record (EHR) data and simulation models will be generated and refined to define the capacity for ICP-PCI to predict the need and response to relevant medical and surgical interventions. Clinical application of ICP-PCI will be compared head-to-head with ICP alone. Successful validation of ICP-PCI would lay the groundwork for the development of a valuable clinical tool for all Centers managing children and possibly adults with severe TBI, that could be readily integrated and implemented using existing ICU monitoring.

"A Learning Health System Approach to Precision Sedation and Analgesia in Critically-Ill Children PROJECT ABSTRACT Approximately 500,000 children suffer critical illness every year in the United States and more than one third will receive a continuous infusion of a sedative-analgesic medication such as an opioid or dexmedetomidine. Such drugs are commonly administered to ease the burden of critical illness by treating serious pain and anxiety associated with invasive organ support delivery and procedures in the intensive care unit. However, there are no widely-accepted standards for the administration of these potent neuroactive medications and several studies have demonstrated that children receive too little or too much of these medications nearly half of the time they are administered. This imprecision in conventional dosing strategies leads to adverse events, including acute physiologic deterioration, drug tolerance and dependency, prolonged illness and hospitalization and life-threatening complications of invasive support such as unplanned extubation and post-extubation airway obstruction. Evidence also indicates that relatively short exposures to these medications may be detrimental to long-term neurodevelopment. More precise strategies for administering these medications to children are needed and this is an issue of major  PROJECT NARRATIVE Clinicians caring for critically ill children routinely struggle to harmonize the tension between giving too much versus too little sedation-analgesia. This work will (1) identify patterns of sedation-analgesia associated with outcome; (2) identify genotypes associated with sedation-analgesia administration; (3) characterize PK parameters of common sedative-analgesic mediations; and (4) promote the development of the PI as an independent Learning Health System researcher.

"Images of Children and Adults for Health Research Abstract: This project's goal of expanding the extant archive for a major longitudinal study to include an innovative collection of images of children and adults is well-aligned with the initiative (PAR-16-149) to support the archiving of NICHD-funded data sets for secondary data analyses. The longitudinal study was funded through a U01 partnership with NICHD, and the images that will be added to its archive can take longitudinal and intergenerational health research in significantly new directions. As background, the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (SECCYD) was a major investment of NICHD in a longitudinal study of children and parents. The observational, survey, medical, biological, and video data from the NICHD- sponsored data collection over 15 years are archived at the Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR), with data collection on the now-adult sample ongoing. A current R01 project by the PIs of this proposal has developed a systematic process for extracting and rating “short slice” images of children and parents from videos. This system has resulted in short slices of children at 11 time points, short slices of mothers at four time points, and ratings of the attractiveness of their faces and bodies at all these time points. The child ratings—along with a detailed codebook—are already being added to the SECCYD archive through the current R01 so that health scholars licensed with ICPSR can merge them with the SECCYD for analyses of child and adolescent development. The proposed R03 would allow a substantial and valuable expansion by also archiving the actual short slices of children, extracting short slices of mothers at the remaining time points, extracting the short slices of fathers at the five time points they were videotaped, and adding all of these short slices to the archive along with expanded codebooks. The PIs are partnering with ICPSR to open up their secure system for housing and organizing these images so that other researchers could use them for their own purposes and not have to travel to the ICSPR data enclave. Such an enterprise would exploit the original R01 project to realize substantial economies of scale in creating a resource for health research to inform a wide array of health and health-relevant literatures. Indeed, a substantial body of research has documented the valid and reliable ways that images of the face and body can be used. For example, scholars could access this expanded SECCYD archive to examine the development of health conditions (e.g., obesity), the corrosive effects of disadvantage on health (e.g., the physical toll of poverty), the link between social stigmas and health (e.g., colorism and depression), family health dynamics (e.g., disjunctures in health of parents and children), and other important questions concerning individual and population health. They can also go beyond human rating to exploit new machine scoring techniques that enable measurements beyond the human eye that provide insights into biological processes (e.g., hormone levels, sexual dimorphism). The codebooks will also provide a template for other scholars to expand their own NIH-funded data collections or to launch new ones. Project Narrative In response to a NICHD funding opportunity on archiving datasets, this project will significantly contribute to a number of fields of health research by archiving an expansive longitudinal set of images of the faces and bodies of children and their parents over a 15 year period. With a secure system to facilitate ease of access and use, such images can be human rated (e.g., perceived age, weight, skin color) and machine scored (e.g., biologically informative facial measurements) to measure continuity and change in physical development and health and to capture the physical toll of the environment on individual wellbeing. Extending a prior NICHD- funded project that rated 11 waves of videos from the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development to longitudinally study children's appearance, this larger archive of images will provide a valuable resource for researchers aiming to conduct innovative research on health and health disparities.",Images of Children and Adults for Health Research,9923679,R03HD096203,"['Academic achievement', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent Development', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Appearance', 'Archives', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Birds', 'Birth', 'Catalogs', 'Child', 'Child Care', 'Child Development', 'Childhood', 'Collection', 'Color', 'Corrosives', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disadvantaged', 'Discipline', 'Documentation', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Family health status', 'Fathers', 'Funding', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grooming', 'Guidelines', 'Half-Life', 'Health', 'Health Resources', 'Health Status', 'Hormones', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Investments', 'Licensing', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Light', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Nose', 'Obesity', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Politics', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Rattus', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Secure', 'Services', 'Slice', 'Social Environment', 'Stress', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testosterone', 'Time', 'Travel', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Videotape', 'Visual', 'Walking', 'Weight', 'Weight Gain', 'base', 'data archive', 'data enclave', 'experience', 'health disparity', 'image archival system', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intergenerational', 'middle age', 'population health', 'recruit', 'response', 'secondary analysis', 'sexual dimorphism', 'skin color', 'social', 'social engagement', 'social implication', 'social stigma', 'transmission process']",NICHD,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R03,2020,83342,0.07475073622402635
"Childhood ‘Omics’ and Mycobacterium tuberculosis-derived BiOsignatures (COMBO) for TB diagnosis in high HIV prevalence settings PROJECT SUMMARY There is an urgent need to develop non-sputum biomarker-based triage and diagnostic tests for childhood tuberculosis (TB). This is particularly important for young children with HIV infection, who have high TB-related mortality but often cannot produce sputum and have lower sputum bacillary burden. Biomarker discovery for childhood TB requires ultra-sensitive platforms to measure low-abundant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) proteins in clinical samples and greater investigation of host proteins, post-translational modifications of proteins, and metabolites that are more likely than upstream RNA expression to reflect the host-pathogen interactions that lead to TB disease. The overall objective of the proposed project is to identify Mtb- and/or host-derived biosignatures in children that can achieve World Health Organization (WHO) target product profile (TPP) accuracy thresholds for a non-sputum biomarker-based triage or diagnostic test for childhood TB. We hypothesize that biosignatures that combine Mtb proteins and host biomarkers with evidence of functional relevance to TB pathogenesis or immunity will have the best diagnostic performance. To assess this hypothesis, we will conduct biomarker discovery and initial clinical validation studies using samples from three well- characterized pediatric TB cohorts in Uganda, The Gambia and South Africa. In Aim 1, we will use an ultra- sensitive electrochemoluminescence (ECL)-based immunoassay to assess the presence of Mtb proteins ESAT- 6, CFP-10, MPT64, MPT32, and Ag85B in a discovery set of banked blood and urine samples from 100 children under 5 years old with confirmed TB and 200 with unlikely TB per NIH consensus definitions (50% HIV prevalence in both groups). In Aim 2, we will use the same discovery set to perform targeted and untargeted mass spectrometry with functional assessment through pathway analysis, in vitro models and in vivo mouse models to identify host proteins, post-translational modifications and metabolites that distinguish children with confirmed versus unlikely TB. In Aim 3, we will use the candidate Mtb and host biomarkers identified in Aims 1 and 2 to derive biosignatures with up to 10 analytes consisting of Mtb proteins only, host biomarkers only, and both Mtb- and host-derived biomarkers. Biosignatures that meet WHO TPP criteria in the discovery set will 1) be evaluated in an independent test set of banked samples from 300 children under 5 years old (100 with confirmed TB, 200 with unlikely TB; 50% HIV prevalence in each group) to verify diagnostic accuracy and establish cut- offs and 2) be evaluated in a prospective cohort of 350 children under 5 years old using the pre-select cut-offs and both microbiological and clinical reference standards. Completion of these aims will result in identification of promising biosignatures that can be further validated in large-scale field studies and translated into point-of-care triage and/or diagnostic tests for childhood TB. PROJECT NARRATIVE The inability to quickly and accurately diagnose tuberculosis (TB) in children and initiate treatment is a major contributor to the high mortality of childhood TB worldwide. This study will identify novel Mtb- and host-derived biomarkers, and determine the best biomarker panels (i.e., biosignatures) that can meet the World Health Organization-recommended diagnostic accuracy thresholds for a TB triage or diagnostic test.

"Predicting the early childhood outcomes of preterm brain shape abnormalities PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The last months of pregnancy are particularly important for the development of the child's brain, and the consequences of premature birth on its development can be substantial. Prematurely born children are at higher risk of various cognitive impairments and exhibits more behavioral disorders than full-term born children. Thus early detection and management of at risk children are essential. There is growing evidence of significant volumetric abnormalities in subcortical structures of premature neonates, which may be associated to negative long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. Understanding these abnormalities could help elucidate the underlying pathophysiology and enable early determination of at-risk patients, both of which would inform the design of novel treatment strategies. However, to date there is still a lack of sensitive, reliable, and accessible algorithms capable of characterizing the influence of prematurity on the anatomy of neonatal brain subcortical structures. In addition, few studies have looked directly at the long-term neurodevelopmental implications of these neonatal subcortical structures abnormalities. Predicting long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes early on – and preferably at neonatal ages – is likely to have a transformative effect on their outcome. Our preliminary data indicate significant morphological differences in the putamen, ventricles, corpus callosum, and thalamus between preterm and term neonates. We propose to develop biomarkers of prematurity by statistically comparing the morphological and diffusion properties of subcortical structures between preterm and term neonates using brain MRI. These results will further be used in a sparse learning framework to predict long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes of prematurity. Hypotheses: By combining subcortical morphological and diffusion properties, we will be able to: (1) delineate specific correlative relationships between structures regionally and differentially affected by normal maturation and different patterns of white matter injury, and (2) improve the specificity of neuroimaging to predict neurodevelopmental outcomes earlier. Aim 1: Build a new toolbox for neonatal subcortical structures analyses that combine 1) a group lasso-based analysis of significant regions of shape changes, 2) a structural correlation network analysis, 3) a neonatal tractography, and 4) tensor-based analysis on tracts. Aim 2: Ascertain biomarkers of prematurity in neonates with different patterns of abnormalities. Aim 3: Assess the predictive potential of imaging and clinical features on neurodevelopmental outcomes among premature children at 12 and 18 months and 6-8 years of age. Impact: This application will provide the first complete subcortical network analysis in both term and preterm neonates. In the first study of its kind for prematurity, we will use sparse and multi-task learning to determine which of the biomarkers of prematurity at birth are the best predictors of long-term outcome. The expected findings could improve our ability to predict these outcomes and enable the design of early treatments – before years of pathological brain development and symptoms occur. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH We propose to develop biomarkers of prematurity by statistically comparing the morphological and diffusion properties of subcortical structures between preterm and term neonates. A better understanding of the neurological biomarkers of prematurity will help promote early clinical management of prematurely born infants who are at higher risk of many neurodevelopmental deficits, including attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and various learning impairments (i.e. dyslexia, dysorthographia, dyscalculia).",Predicting the early childhood outcomes of preterm brain shape abnormalities,9994891,R01EB025032,"['8 year old', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain scan', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Cognitive', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dyslexia', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Exhibits', 'Functional disorder', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Lasso', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Neonatal', 'Network-based', 'Neurodevelopmental Deficit', 'Neurologic', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Problem behavior', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain shape', 'caudate nucleus', 'design', 'early childhood', 'hearing impairment', 'high risk', 'improved', 'interest', 'lateral ventricle', 'mathematics disability', 'morphometry', 'multi-task learning', 'neonatal brain', 'neonate', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'premature', 'preterm newborn', 'putamen', 'social communication', 'tractography', 'treatment strategy', 'vector', 'white matter', 'white matter injury']",NIBIB,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OF LOS ANGELES,R01,2020,448068,0.013576843711666734
"Inflammation Phenotypes in Pediatric Sepsis Induced Multiple Organ Failure Renewal Carcillo R01 Project Abstract Every year over 1 million American adults and children develop overwhelming infection leading to a rotting of their body we call ‘sepsis’, and death in up to 1 of 3 afflicted (www.nigms.nih.gov>NIGMS Home>Science Education). National efforts emphasizing early recognition, intravenous fluids to help organs, and antibiotics to kill infection, have reduced mortality so that now 1 of 4 die. We and others have asked the question “why do patients continue to die despite these national efforts?’ In the previous funding period we showed in 401 children with sepsis that those who developed organ shut down despite these efforts, did so because they were a) unable to fight germs causing unending infection, b) unable to stop clotting off their body causing kidney failure, and/or c) unable to kill viruses causing liver failure; all of which led to death from uncontrolled inflammation with clotting, bleeding and liver failure. Fortunately, each of these organ shutdown groups has hopeful treatments. With the new information we collected in the previous funding period we have already designed and started clinical trials testing these treatments including immune boosters for children unable to kill germs, plasma removal and replacement using plasma exchange for children unable to stop clotting, monoclonal antibodies to kill viruses and their homes to reverse liver failure in children unable to do so on their own, and anti-inflammatory proteins to reverse uncontrollable inflammation, in hopes of helping save many of the 1 of 4 children still dying from sepsis related organ shutdown. In this next funding period, we propose to use the clinical information and samples already obtained in our previous study to take advantage of the wonderful advances made this millenia in computer technology, big data, bioinformatics, and the study of human and virus genetics to perform Specific Aim 1) use a ‘Watson’ like approach to ask the computer to help us figure out if the children with sepsis have any other causes of organ shutdown that we can help, Specific Aim 2) use an ‘Ancestry.com’-like or ‘23 and me’-like approach to identify ‘precision medicine’ therapies for causes of organ shutdown that we can treat on a patient by patient basis, and Specific Aim 3) use a bedside molecular biology test approach to identify individualized therapies to kill DNA viruses and reduce cytokine inflammation. We think that DNA viruses are the unappreciated co-infection which causes uncontrolled cytokine inflammation and leads to organ shutdown. Our long term objective is to plan ‘precision’ medicine and ‘individualized’ medicine clinical trials testing therapies on an individual patient basis in order to further reduce death from sepsis organ shutdown in children. Carcillo R01 Narrative Statement Every year over 1 million American adults and children develop overwhelming infection leading to a rotting of their body we call ‘sepsis’, and death in up to 1 of 4 afflicted (www.nigms.nih.gov>NIGMS Home>Science Education). In our previous funding period we showed that this occurs when groups of patients are unable to kill germs, stop clotting or bleeding, or stop viruses from reproducing, and we have therefore designed and begun clinical trials to help these children do so. In this new funding period we are using ‘Watson’-like, ‘Twenty three and me’-like, and ‘Ancestry.com’-like approaches to figure out how to help each child with individually tailored treatments that are best at helping them live long and happy lives.",Inflammation Phenotypes in Pediatric Sepsis Induced Multiple Organ Failure Renewal,10017690,R01GM108618,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Adenoviruses', 'Adult', 'American', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Antibiotics', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Coagulation Process', 'Complement', 'Computers', 'Cytomegalovirus', 'DNA', 'DNA Viruses', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Excision', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Germ', 'Hemorrhage', 'Herpesvirus 1', 'Home environment', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Herpesvirus 4', 'Human Herpesvirus 6', 'IV Fluid', 'Immune', 'Immunity', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Interleukin-1', 'Interleukin-18', 'Interleukin-6', 'Kidney Failure', 'Knowledge', 'Liver Failure', 'Machine Learning', 'Macrophage activation syndrome', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Multiple Organ Failure', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Natural Immunity', 'Organ', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Intensive Care Units', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Exchange', 'Precision medicine trial', 'Proteins', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Septic Shock', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Syndrome', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thrombocytopenia', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Viremia', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'adaptive immunity', 'base', 'clinical biomarkers', 'co-infection', 'cohort', 'cytokine', 'design', 'exome', 'fighting', 'gene interaction', 'genetic analysis', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'recruit', 'science education', 'septic patients', 'targeted treatment', 'trial design', 'virus genetics']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,500320,0.08134066739274051
"Linking State Medicaid and Congenital Heart Surgical Registry Data: Building Capacity to Assess Disparities in Longitudinal Outcomes and Value for Children with Congenital Heart Disease Project Summary Congenital heart defects are the most common and resource intensive birth defects managed in the United States with high morbidity and mortality. They are estimated to effect over 1 million US children and 1.4 million US adults and to result in ~200,000 life-years lost and >$6 billion in inpatient acute care costs per year. Significant disparities are known to exist in short-term outcomes and resource utilization. We have shown that children from low income neighborhoods have 18% higher risk-adjusted odds of in-hospital mortality, have 7% longer lengths-of-stay, and require 7% more perioperative resources than do children from higher income neighborhoods, even after controlling for the effects of race, public versus private insurance provider, and the hospitals at which these children ultimately receive surgical repair. Research on long-term outcomes and health expenditures is limited and mechanisms driving health inequities remain unknown. Greater than 50% of children with congenital heart disease are covered by Medicaid. We have partnered with the NY Department of Health and have clean, validated data for all Medicaid patient encounters over 15 years across NY State. We have developed methods of abstracting and linking locally-held clinical registry data to Medicaid files and have built an interdisciplinary team of pediatric cardiologists, cardiac surgeons, health services researchers, health economists, and NY Department of Health senior leadership to identify dimensions of healthcare access that could be targeted through center- or state-level interventions to reduce inequities. We propose linking pediatric cardiac surgical clinical registry data from across NY State, longitudinal Medicaid claims, Census Bureau data, geocoded data, and the National Death Index. We will use these data to accomplish the following Aims: 1) We will define 10-year risk-stratified, multi-dimensional outcomes (mortality and morbidities) and associated health expenditures for children undergoing congenital heart surgery across New York State; 2) we will develop novel longitudinal risk models for children with congenital heart disease that adjust for social determinants of health, and 3) we will test dimensions of healthcare access as modifiable drivers of health inequities among children in New York with congenital heart disease on Medicaid. Achieving our aims would 1) establish a comprehensive, population-based resource for longitudinal outcomes and health expenditure research, inclusive of not only in-patient data, but also out-patient, emergency room, pharmacy, rehabilitation, home healthcare, education records, and neighborhood-level social determinants of health for nearly half of all children undergoing congenital heart surgery in NY State, 2) generate a methodology for investigations on long-term outcomes and value applicable across multiple populations, 3) assess constructs of access as modifiable mediators of social determinants of health, and 4) position us to translate these findings into policy and care changes to reduce health inequities. Project Narrative Congenital heart defects are the most common and resource intensive birth defects managed in the United States, estimated to effect over 1 million US children and 1.4 million US adults and to result in ~200,000 life- years lost and >$6 billion in inpatient acute care costs per year, with significantly worse outcomes for children from lower income neighborhoods and minorities. Despite the high prevalence, research on long-term outcomes and health expenditures is limited and etiologies of health inequities remain unknown. Linking clinical registries with longitudinal state-wide Medicaid data will 1) build a scalable resource that will allow us to assess longitudinal outcomes and resource requirements at a population level 2) generate a methodology for investigations on long-term outcomes and value, 3) assess constructs of access as modifiable mediators of social determinants of health, and 4) immediately inform policy and care.",Linking State Medicaid and Congenital Heart Surgical Registry Data: Building Capacity to Assess Disparities in Longitudinal Outcomes and Value for Children with Congenital Heart Disease,9864807,R01HL150044,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Accounting', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'American', 'American Heart Association', 'Automobile Driving', 'Base Ratios', 'Birth', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Cardiology', 'Caring', 'Censuses', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Charge', 'Child', 'Child Mortality', 'Childhood', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Congenital Heart Defects', 'Congresses', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Linkages', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Expenditure', 'Health', 'Health Expenditures', 'Health Services', 'Heart', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Prevalence', 'Home Care Services', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Insurance', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Leadership', 'Length of Stay', 'Link', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medicaid', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neighborhoods', 'New York', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Perioperative', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Physiology', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Privatization', 'Provider', 'Race', 'Records', 'Registries', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Surgeon', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States', 'abstracting', 'acute care', 'care costs', 'college', 'congenital heart disorder', 'cost', 'data registry', 'disorder subtype', 'follow-up', 'health care availability', 'health care service', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'mortality', 'neighborhood disadvantage', 'neonatal surgery', 'novel', 'pediatric cardiologist', 'population based', 'repaired', 'social determinants', 'social health determinants', 'years of life lost']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,495156,0.07302173793228474
