"Direct Determination of Multiple Specific Forms of DNA Chemical Modifications in Human Genome PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The information content of DNA is not limited to the primary sequence (A, C, G, T), but is also conveyed by chemical modifications of individual bases. For example, DNA methylation, specifically 5-methylcytosine (5mC), has been widely studied for its important regulatory roles in human development and diseases. In addition, the discovery of active demethylation of 5mC, mediated by TET enzymes, into 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), 5-formylcytosine (5fC) and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC) revealed great insights into the dynamic nature of the human methylome and its close relevance to multiple human diseases. Beyond these chemical modifications to cytosine, recent studies by us and others discovered that N6-methyladenine (6mA), another form of methylation previously thought exclusively existing in bacteria and protozoa, also exists in eukaryotic genomes including the human genome. In addition to these epigenetic marks, different forms of DNA damages represent another category of DNA chemical modifications that are of important biological relevance. Although a few methods for mapping individual chemical modifications have been developed and some are widely used, it is usually hard for broad researchers to master every protocol to map each form of modification. While third- generation sequencing technologies support the direct detection of DNA modifications, they face fundamental challenges distinguishing among different forms of modifications. The objective of this project is to develop a novel technology for the direct mapping of multiple forms of DNA methylation and DNA damage events simultaneously. The core idea is that each form of nucleic acid modification has a unique signature in terms of their physical interaction with DNA polymerase, or nanopores in third-generation sequencing; and these signatures can be modeled by deep learning methods. We will develop this technology using multiple innovative strategies to address a few fundamental challenges, and then comprehensively evaluate the technology to facilitate broad applications. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chemical DNA modifications are crucial components of human genome that controls many important biological processes in human development and human diseases. In this project, we will develop a novel technology for direct mapping of multiple and specific forms of DNA modifications, which will enable us and a large number of researchers to more effectively study the functions of DNA modifications in human genome.",Direct Determination of Multiple Specific Forms of DNA Chemical Modifications in Human Genome,10204438,R01HG011095,"['Address', 'Antibodies', 'Bacteria', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Cytosine', 'DNA', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Modification Process', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Ensure', 'Enzymes', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Face', 'Future', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Human Characteristics', 'Human Development', 'Human Genome', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Individual', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Neurons', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Performance', 'Ploidies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Protozoa', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Technology', 'Third Generation Sequencing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'cancer risk', 'cell type', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'demethylation', 'exome', 'experience', 'human disease', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'methylome', 'nanopore', 'network models', 'new technology', 'prototype', 'sequencing platform', 'single molecule', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2021,833051
"Pan-disease characterization of DNA methylation dysregulation DNA methylation is an important epigenetic mark with a regulated pattern in healthy tissues. Disruption of this pattern, called methylation dysregulation, has been reported in many diseases including cancer, autoimmune diseases, metabolic and psychological disorders, and diseases related to aging. Importantly, methylation dysregulation has been observed in pre-disease states and the degree of dysregulation correlates with disease severity and also response to treatment. These observations compel the study of methylation dysregulation because it may reveal common origins of human disease, and because genomic elements (e.g. genes, mutations, and regulatory features) associated with methylation dysregulation may be potential targets for diagnostic and early intervention therapies. However, the genomic elements that control and maintain methylation dysregulation have not been well-characterized. Understanding the mechanisms and pathways that are responsible for the establishment of epigenetic dysregulation is critical for understanding the establishment of the disease phenotype in general. We hypothesize that specific genomic elements could contribute to methylation dysregulation in reproducible ways across diseases. This research seeks to identify genomic elements that may initiate a disease state that is common across multiple diseases. This will be accomplished by the development of computational algorithms to leverage and integrate patient samples from many diseases, as well as the development of a new high-throughput genomic screen. Specifically, we propose the following specific aims: (1) Identification of genes associated with methylation dysregulation using a pan-disease machine-learning approach; (2) Exploration of the contribution of the noncoding genome to methylation dysregulation through analysis of  genome variants and chromatin accessibility data; (3) Development and validation of a novel CRISPR screen to link gene perturbations to methylation  landscapes in a high-throughput manner. In summary, completion of these aims will produce an in-depth characterization of the genomic elements associated with methylation dysregulation, leading to understanding of the processes and mechanisms of epigenetic dysregulation. More broadly, the proposed analysis framework and computational approach will explore the utility of integrative pan-disease studies to identify common characteristics of disease which could lead to diagnostic and therapeutic solutions. This proposal takes advantage of the applicant's expertise in genetics, genomics, and high-throughput assays. It also includes training and research experience in experimental design and execution which will advance the candidate's goal of becoming an independent research scientist capable of investigating genome function, specifically the genomic origins of human disease. DNA methylation patterns are dysregulated in many human diseases, suggesting that elements of disease initiation may be common across diseases. The proposed research aims to characterize pan-disease patterns of methylation dysregulation and to identify genes and regulators that lead to methylation dysregulation. This will contribute to fundamental knowledge of disease initiation and identify potential targets for disease diagnosis and treatment.",Pan-disease characterization of DNA methylation dysregulation,10191781,K99HG011658,"['Affect', 'Aging', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Biological Assay', 'CRISPR screen', 'Characteristics', 'Chromatin', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Collection', 'Computational algorithm', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Methylation Regulation', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elements', 'Enzymes', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Experimental Designs', 'Fingerprint', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Mutation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mental disorders', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Mutate', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Severity of illness', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'cost', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'disease diagnosis', 'disease phenotype', 'epigenome', 'experience', 'genome analysis', 'genomic variation', 'high throughput screening', 'human disease', 'large datasets', 'methylation pattern', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome', 'treatment response']",NHGRI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K99,2021,170402

"Unbiased identification and characterization of mouse metastable epialleles PROJECT SUMMARY (Abstract) In addition to genetics and environment, interindividual variation in epigenetic regulation may determine risk of obesity. Exceptional genomic loci called metastable epialleles offer unprecedented opportunities to test this. Metastable epialleles – essentially epigenetic polymorphisms – exhibit interindividual variation in DNA methylation that is neither tissue-specific nor genetically mediated. Metastable epialleles were first discovered in mice when dramatic phenotypic variation was observed amongst inbred mice. Over the last 10 years we pioneered the discovery and characterization of human metastable epialleles. We have shown that DNA methylation profiling of multiple tissues in multiple individuals is an effective approach to identifying regions that exhibit systemic interindividual variation in DNA methylation, a hallmark of metastable epialleles. Now that we know epigenetic metastability is common to mice and humans, it is essential to identify and explore the full range of MEs in the mouse. We therefore propose to pursue the following Specific Aims: Aim 1 - Perform an unbiased screen for mouse metastable epialleles. Aim 2 - Test for effects of maternal dietary methyl donor supplementation on offspring DNA methylation at metastable epialleles. Aim 3: Use comparative genomics to identify sequence determinants of epigenetic metastability. Successful completion of these Aims will provide the foundation for development of mouse (and potentially other mammalian) models which will enable controlled experiments to help understand how interindividual variation in DNA methylation affects risk of disease in humans. PROJECT NARRATIVE (Relevance Statement) Just as individual genetic variation can affect risk of disease, so too can individual epigenetic variation. In particular, special genomic regions called metastable epialleles, which were first discovered in mice, offer the best opportunities to advance our understanding of epigenetic etiology of disease because their systemic nature means that – like genetic polymorphisms – they can be assessed in any easily obtainable tissue sample, such as peripheral blood. Now that we know that metastable epialleles also exist in humans, we urgently need to develop a more complete catalog of these genomic regions in the mouse, to enable well- controlled experiments to advance our understanding of the causes and consequences of interindividual epigenetic variation at these loci.",Unbiased identification and characterization of mouse metastable epialleles,10190936,R01DK125562,"['Affect', 'Area', 'Assisted Reproductive Technology', 'Base Sequence', 'Beds', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Cleft Palate', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA methylation profiling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Dietary Supplementation', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Germ Layers', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Inbred Mouse', 'Individual', 'Individuality', 'Intracisternal A-Particle Elements', 'Label', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Methylation', 'Micronutrients', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Nutritional', 'Nutritional Study', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pancreas', 'Paper', 'Phenotype', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrotransposon', 'Seminal', 'Supplementation', 'Tail', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Toxicology', 'Variant', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'catalyst', 'cell type', 'comparative genomics', 'critical period', 'dietary', 'disorder risk', 'early pregnancy', 'embryo culture', 'epigenetic regulation', 'epigenetic variation', 'experimental study', 'genomic locus', 'improved', 'inter-individual variation', 'metabolic phenotype', 'mother nutrition', 'mouse development', 'mouse genome', 'mouse model', 'nonhuman primate', 'nutrition', 'obesity risk', 'offspring', 'peripheral blood', 'transgenerational epigenetic inheritance']",NIDDK,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,462430
"Role of Epigenetically Active Environmental Compounds in Neurodevelopmental Disorders PROJECT SUMMARY Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), are increasingly recognized as originating from dysregulation of early brain development, which represents a window of vulnerability to environmental compounds. Environmental compounds may alter neurodevelopment via epigenetic mechanisms, which may not induce massive cell death, but change the brain function through their epigenetic effect on stem cell fate and lineage development. However, tools to systematically examine the epigenetic impact of environment on neurodevelopment are lacking. Here we employ Microscopic Imaging of Epigenetic Landscape (MIEL) to screen ToxCast e1k chemical library (1800 compounds) and to characterize hits that alter epigenetic landscape of human neural precursors without inducing cytotoxicity. Recognizing environmental insults and understanding their mechanism of action will enable the development of regulations and guidelines aimed at avoiding such insults and the development of antidotes and protective agents when exposure is unavoidable. PROJECT NARRATIVE We developed a novel technique rooted in analysis of the epigenome topography at the single-cell level. Here, we propose to employ our new approach to identify novel environmental inducers of NDD.",Role of Epigenetically Active Environmental Compounds in Neurodevelopmental Disorders,10219009,R21ES032583,"['3-Dimensional', 'ASD patient', 'ATAC-seq', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Antidotes', 'Aromatic Polycyclic Hydrocarbons', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Brain', 'Case Study', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exposure to', 'Female', 'Fetal Development', 'Flowcharts', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Human body', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Neurites', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neuronal Differentiation', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Plant Roots', 'Process', 'Protective Agents', 'Publishing', 'Registries', 'Regulation', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Services', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalidomide', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Vertebrates', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'bisphenol A', 'cell growth', 'cost effective', 'cytotoxicity', 'dashboard', 'environmental chemical', 'epigenome', 'experimental study', 'high throughput screening', 'histone modification', 'human model', 'in vivo', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'insight', 'male', 'man', 'microscopic imaging', 'nerve stem cell', 'neurodevelopment', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'phthalates', 'prenatal exposure', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'self-renewal', 'small molecule libraries', 'stem', 'stem cell fate', 'stem cell model', 'stem cells', 'synaptogenesis', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIEHS,SANFORD BURNHAM PREBYS MEDICAL DISCOVERY INSTITUTE,R21,2021,195000
"Spatial Epigenomic Profiling of Immune Cell Signatures at Subcellular Resolution in Health and Disease SPATIAL EPIGENOMIC PROFILING OF IMMUNE CELL SIGNATURES AT SUBCELLULAR  RESOLUTION IN HEALTH AND DISEASE More than ten percent of childhood cancers are still incurable and need novel therapies. Epigenetic treatments deserve special attention with their specificity and reduced toxicity. Here I plan to explore epigenetic profiles of immune and cancer cells in normal development and blood cancer patients under the mentorship of Garry Nolan for single cell proteomics technology development, in collaboration with Howard Chang for implementation of epigenomic methods such as chromosome accessibility assays, and with Kara Davis for epigenetics studies of treatment resistant B cell subtypes in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Epigenetic measurements have been limited to bulk level sequencing and ligation assays or limited number of imaging markers. To address these limitations, I will use an emerging three dimensional (3D) proteomic imaging technology in individual cells, termed as 3D Multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI) or 3D MIBI. Epigenetics research by 3D MIBI benefits from high degree multiplexing (up to 100 markers) and super resolution imaging capability (20 nm x-y; 5 nm z resolution), providing exciting opportunities to study genomic sites, methylated DNA, protein factors, and chromosome accessibility, all within the same experiments in single immune and aberrant (leukemic) cells. To systematically determine epigenetic states, I plan to utilize clonal B cell lines to decipher variability of epigenetic components including chromatin states, protein factors and modifiers by a fifty-marker 3D MIBI panel (Aim 1). These experiments will show distribution of epigenetic factors (linear or log-scale) in their expression levels and spatial variations (global or local) in the chromatin states. I will then perform experiments with primary B cells isolated from six different bone marrow aspirates of normal human subjects (Aim 2). I will correlate epigenetic signatures of each B cell subtype to corresponding development state (progenitor, pre, post, or mature). I will then perform an ex vivo co-culture of primary B cells on OP9 stromal cells over 1-6 weeks of culturing, which will be followed by fixation and profiling by 3D MIBI. These perturbation experiments will show how signaling events from neighboring cells drive necessary epigenetic conditions that are required for reaching a B cell subset. Finally, I will turn to primary B cells that are isolated from twenty newly diagnosed ALL patients (Aim 3). I will dissect differentiation and spatial epigenomic remodeling of responder B cell subsets and treatment resistant B cell subtypes from bone marrow aspirates using the OP9 co-culture. These will show how treatment resistance arises from a single epigenetic state or multiple distinct epigenetic signatures. I will then screen Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) on the same co-culture of B cell subtypes from ALL and stromal cells. By varying concentration and duration of inhibition conditions, I will dissect the role of epigenetic drugs in spatial chromatin remodeling toward development of epigenetic therapies in ALL. Together, these experiments will shed light on the role of epigenetic programming for cancer treatment applications from immune cell signatures in normal subjects and blood cancer patients. Public Health Relevance: Epigenetic alterations in immune and cancer cells regulate normal development and aberrant formation in humans. We reveal spatial heterogeneity and dynamic changes in epigenetic states of B cell subtypes from healthy and diseased subjects using a novel multiplex imaging mass cytometry. Deciphering the role of epigenetic perturbations in treatment resistant B cells will guide development of efficient and safe epigenetic therapies for pediatric blood cancers.",Spatial Epigenomic Profiling of Immune Cell Signatures at Subcellular Resolution in Health and Disease,10201436,K25AI140783,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia', 'Address', 'Aspirate substance', 'Attention', 'B-Cell Development', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cancer Patient', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Childhood Hematopoietic Neoplasm', 'Chromatin', 'Chromosomes', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Collaborations', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Analysis', 'Cytometry', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Enzymes', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Four-dimensional', 'Future', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Hematopoietic Neoplasms', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor', 'Human', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune', 'Immunotherapy', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Leukemic Cell', 'Libraries', 'Ligation', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Childhood Neoplasm', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Stem cell transplant', 'Stromal Cells', 'System', 'Technology', 'Toxic effect', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Variant', 'Visualization', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'chemotherapy', 'chromatin remodeling', 'design', 'epigenetic drug', 'epigenetic therapy', 'epigenetic variation', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'human subject', 'imaging approach', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging capabilities', 'lymphoblast', 'mathematical analysis', 'multiplexed imaging', 'nanometer', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pediatric patients', 'progenitor', 'public health relevance', 'sample fixation', 'shape analysis', 'single cell analysis', 'success', 'technology development', 'therapy design', 'therapy resistant', 'treatment response']",NIAID,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,K25,2021,107880
"DNA 3.0: Developing novel enzymes for DNA synthesis with deep learning and combinatorial genetics Project Summary/Abstract  DNA synthesis has played a key role in the biotechnology revolution. The ready availability of synthetic DNA oligonucleotides and of genes assembled from them, has been invaluable for elucidating and unlocking biological function and enabling the new field of synthetic biology which can create novel cells, enzymes, therapeutics, diagnostics and other reagents of commercial value. Despite this impact, DNA synthesis uses chemical strategies developed over 30 years ago which are costly and limited to molecules of 200 nucleotides or less in length.  Next-generation enzymatic DNA synthesis technologies are being explored that use template- independent DNA polymerases (TIDPs) for controlled addition of nucleotides to a growing DNA strand. Although advances have been reported recently, enzymatic DNA synthesis is still limited by the low efficiency of available TIDPs, and specifically by the relative inability of these polymerases to incorporate 3'-blocked nucleotides.  In this Phase I Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project, Primordial Genetics Inc, a synthetic biology company with differentiated combinatorial genetic technology, and Denovium Inc., an artificial intelligence company pioneering novel Al methods for genetic discovery, are joining forces to develop novel and highly efficient TIDPs for enzymatic DNA synthesis in vitro.  Denovium will use their computational capabilities based on machine learning algorithms to discover novel TIDPs with the desired activities from proprietary and public databases. Denovium will also perform proprietary artificial intelligence (AI) scans to determine the functional impact of all possible mutations on the selected TIDPs. Primordial Genetics will synthesize and express the resulting collection of sequences, and test them in vitro to identify the most active enzymes. The best 2 enzymes will be diversified using Primordial Genetics' proprietary Function Generator technology and other randomized diversification methods. Populations of genes encoding enzyme variants will be screened with ultra-high-throughput screens to identify the most active enzymes. The dataset resulting from this work will be used to train Denovium's sequence prediction algorithm to accelerate further enzyme improvements in Phase II.  The proposed work is a feasibility study for isolating and developing novel enzymes suitable for enzymatic DNA synthesis, and also for creating a pipeline of enzyme optimization tools. The enzymes discovered and in this work will be directly useful for enzymatic DNA synthesis applications, and can be licensed or sold to leading DNA and gene manufaturers. Project Narrative The principal aim of this project is to develop novel and improved DNA polymerases for the industrial synthesis of DNA, which is currently performed by synthetic chemical methods and represents one of the cornerstone technologies of the biotechnology industry. To overcome limitations of the current chemical technology in cost, efficiency and the length of DNA molecules that can be synthesized, there have been widespread attempts to develop specific DNA polymerases as efficient molecular machines for synthesizing DNA. This project will develop novel and more efficient polymerases than are currently available, which will impact the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of human diseases such as cancer, heart disease, HIV and genetic diseases such as cystic fibrosis.",DNA 3.0: Developing novel enzymes for DNA synthesis with deep learning and combinatorial genetics,10304760,R43HG010995,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Process', 'Biotechnology', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Collection', 'Cost efficiency', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'DNA', 'DNA biosynthesis', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Enzymes', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'HIV', 'Heart Diseases', 'In Vitro', 'Industrialization', 'Industry', 'Length', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Molecular Machines', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Polymerase', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Randomized', 'Reagent', 'Reporting', 'Research Project Grants', 'Scanning', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'genetic technology', 'high throughput screening', 'human disease', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'next generation', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'synthetic biology', 'synthetic construct', 'tool']",NHGRI,"PRIMORDIAL GENETICS, INC",R43,2021,52000
"Molecular images and machine learning to extract placental function from maternal cfDNA Abstract  Circulating cell free DNA (cfDNA) has revolutionized prenatal diagnostics, but this is the tip of the iceberg, as cfDNA fragmentation patterns embed epigenetic footprints indicative of cell of origin, cellular function and pathological state. cfDNA is fragmented with sizes centered around 145bp and 166bp which is approximately the length of DNA wrapped around a nucleosome, and a nucleosome plus its linker, respectively. Shorter fragments (30-100bp) also exist and have a clear periodicity of 10bp, corresponding to a turn of the DNA helix wrapped around the core histone. Recent reports have shown that the fragmentation sizes of cfDNA are tissue specific, which is a product of distinct nucleosome spacing that is inherent in the function of individual tissues. When these individual fragments are compared with existing epigenetic data from tissues, they can be binned into cell of origin simply based on whether they reveal the nucleosome positioning information of the originating tissue. Identifying cfDNA fragments of placental origin from maternal circulation would provide a non-invasive means of assessing placental function during human pregnancy.  Several major barriers inhibit cfDNA as a non-invasive method for examining placental function: 1) the ability to accurately identify the placental origin of the short <160bp cfDNA fragments that constitute regulatory information (paternal SNPs occur at frequency of approximately 1/2000bp). 2) the ability to use these fragments to piece together precise epigenetic states of the placenta. 3) the cost of deep whole genome sequencing that has traditionally been required to deconvolute epigenetic profiles of admixed cellular origins. Our goal is to overcome each of these barriers by exploiting state-of-the-art genomics and machine learning techniques to extract precise information about human placental function from cfDNA. We will first compile robust and accurate nucleosome information, including epigenetic and transcription factor occupancy, from the human placenta and then we will establish machine-learning platforms to elucidate placental cfDNA from maternal circulation at low cost. Success in this project will enable earlier intervention for high-risk pregnancies and facilitate the longitudinal, non-invasive real-time monitoring of pregnancy progression, thereby informing adaptive treatment decision-making. Narrative Circulating cell free DNA (cfDNA) has revolutionized prenatal diagnostics, but this is the tip of the iceberg, as cfDNA fragmentation patterns embed epigenetic footprints indicative of cell of origin, cellular function and pathological state.

"Computational modeling of DNA methylation-mediated gene regulation Abstract Large numbers of complete methylomes are being acquired through clinical sequencing projects, such as through The Cancer Genome Atlas, Blueprint Epigenome Project, and International Cancer Genome Consortium. Furthermore, third-generation nanopore sequencers, which detect DNA methylation and genetic variation in a single experiment, are nearly ready for routine clinical sequencing and will provide complete methylomes for all patients where whole-genome sequencing is indicated. Current analysis tools however only perform preliminary methylome processing and catalogue differentially methylated regions (DMRs). In order to transform methylome analysis into a clinically useful diagnostic/prognostic test, we need to develop predictive tools to interpret the functional and pathological consequences of identified methylation changes. Towards this goal, we have published a series of papers demonstrating that machine-learning based models utilizing high- resolution signatures of all methylation changes around a promoter vastly outperform conventional DMR methods. Our models accurately predict expression states at genes potentially regulated by methylation and reveal predictive methylation signatures that facilitate mechanistic interpretation. Nonetheless, several challenges remain before we can achieve our goals of translating genome-wide methylation data for routine clinical use: (1) To our knowledge, no current models integrate distal enhancers, whose activation is affected by DNA methylation. Such integrative analysis is necessary to understand consequences of methylation changes in cancers, whose genomes frequently undergo wide-spread methylation changes. In addition, such modelling will be essential to understand the role of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), which may play both repressive and activating roles in neurons depending on whether it is found at promoters or enhancers. (2) Our current models (and conventional approaches) represent methylation data independent of DNA sequence despite mechanistic studies demonstrating that methylation changes can have different functional effects depending on which sequences change and depending on the context of the local regulatory grammar. In this proposal, we will meet these challenges by first developing a predictive model that incorporates 5-methylcytosine and 5hmC at promoters and enhancers to determine how these marks act in concert. In particular, we will examine the hypothesized dual role of 5hmC as a repressor at promoters and as an activator at enhancers in cortical neurons. We will then use new advances in natural language processing to model DNA sequence and methylation to predict expression states. Our results will reveal which regulatory elements and transcription factors binding sites are affected by DNA methylation and how changes at different sites collaborate to affect expression changes. We will experimentally validate our in silico predictions using a combination of reporter assays and CRISPR- based epigenome-editing tools. Thus, the software tools we develop will form an important toolkit for the analysis and mechanistic interpretation of whole-genome methylation studies, both in the laboratory and clinic. Public Narrative DNA normally undergoes a variety of chemical modifications including the addition of methyl- and hydroxymethyl- groups to cytosines (DNA methylation). Though we are unsure how to interpret them, abnormal patterns of DNA methylation are often found in human diseases and will likely soon be routinely measured in the clinic. In this proposal, we will develop advanced computational approaches to predict the functional and pathological consequences of DNA methylation changes in disease. In the future, the approaches we develop will lead to software that suggests individualized therapies for patients based on clinical methylation data.",Computational modeling of DNA methylation-mediated gene regulation,10168608,R01LM013096,"['Affect', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Cytosine', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'International', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mus', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurons', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Paper', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Publishing', 'Recurrence', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Resolution', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Training', 'Translating', 'base', 'cancer genome', 'cancer type', 'clinical sequencing', 'cofactor', 'demethylation', 'embryonic stem cell', 'epigenetic therapy', 'epigenome', 'epigenome editing', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide methylation', 'genome-wide', 'histone modification', 'human disease', 'in silico', 'individualized medicine', 'long short term memory network', 'methylation pattern', 'methylome', 'mutant', 'nanopore', 'network architecture', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prognostic', 'prognostic assays', 'promoter', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'success', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'whole genome']",NLM,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,366581
"Peripheral blood mononuclear cell epigenetic associations in and biomarkers for knee osteoarthritis development and progression Project Summary / Abstract The objective of the proposed research is to better understand how peripheral blood epigenetic patterns are associated with knee osteoarthritis (OA). A great deal of work has already been demonstrated widespread epigenetic changes within articular tissues in both knee and hip OA. Others have described serum and urine protein biomarkers as predictors of future knee OA progression. Our first Aim is to evaluate peripheral blood cell DNA epigenetic patterns in baseline blood samples from patients who will go on to have rapid radiographc and/or pain progression in the subsequent 24 months. We will then use these data to develop develop and evaluate the performance of epigenetic algorithmic models to discriminate these groups. Patient samples will parallel the National Institutes of Health OA Biomarkers Consortium (OABC-FNIH) study. DNA methylation will be evaluated using a next-generation bisulfite sequencing approach (methylSeq), and algorithms developed using cutting-edge machine learning techniques. We will then translate our findings into a more high- throughput, inexpensive, and clinically relevant form by developing and validating a targeted capture sequencing system to interrogate these specific epigenetic locations. Our second Aim is to evaluate the peripheral blood DNA methylation patterns that precede the development of OA, using samples from 48-, 24-, 12-, and 0-months before incident OA. We will again develop algorithms to predict future OA development using similar techniques as Aim 1 and translate this to a targeted capture sequencing system. This unique longitudinal approach which will allow us not only to determine whether and when epigenetic patterns develop preceding OA development, but also track longitudinal epigenetic changes as OA develops. The proposed work is important, as there are no FDA approved biomarkers for OA diagnosis or prognosis. Our work is quite innovative both in its combination of ""big data"" epigenetic analysis and cutting-edge machine learning techniques applied to a specific clinical problem, as well as in its examination of PBMC epigenetics in OA, which has not yet been described. Moreover, we tackle the problem of translation of big-data research by aiming specifically to develop high-throughput methods to translate our findings into a clinically-relevant and accessible form. Success in our proposal will produce both algorithmic models with direct clinical impact to predict future OA development and progression, as well as broaden our understanding of epigenetic changes in peripheral blood cells from OA patients. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because a better understanding of blood epigenetic patterns in osteoarthritis (OA) is likely not only to give insights into the causes of OA, but also to give rise to new biomarkers to assist physicians and researchers diagnose OA patients and predict how rapidly they will worsen over time.

"From epigenome to genome and back: disentangling the relationship between epigenetic modifications and chromatin organization PROJECT SUMMARY Understanding how the genome functions is one of the greatest challenges of the 21st century. Encoded within its DNA sequences are the blueprints for several cell types. Nevertheless, it remains a mystery how the full variety of phenotypes arise, and how they are maintained. It is becoming increasingly clear that the epigenome— covalent modifications to the DNA and histone proteins—plays a crucial role. Genome-wide profiling of epigenetic modifications has clarified cell type specificity and the presence of a diverse set of combinatorial patterns that are strongly correlated with gene expression levels. Inferring causal relationships from these data has proved challenging, however. A working knowledge of the mechanisms that inform the establishment and regulation of the epigenome, and its impact on gene expression and cellular phenotype, therefore, remain elusive. In this project, we propose several novel modeling approaches which will address the key gaps in our understanding of the interrelationship between the epigenome and genome. First, we will parameterize a coarse- grained chromatin model from the bottom-up using a novel deep learning algorithm to generate an accurate and comprehensive characterization of chromatin secondary structure, and its sensitivity to DNA sequence, nucleosome repeat length, ionic concentrations, post-translational modifications, and phase-separated liquid- droplets formed by intrinsically disordered proteins. High resolution chromatin structures from this effort will elucidate how different epigenetic modifications impact gene expression by regulating nucleosome packaging and DNA accessibility. Second, we will investigate the role of epigenetic modifications in mediating long-range interactions between regulatory elements by developing a predictive model which will enable de novo reconstruction of three-dimensional genome organization. This project will result in a global view of the role of the epigenome in cell differentiation and cell fate determination. An improved understanding of the interrelationship between the epigenome and the genome from this research program can guide the development of engineering approaches to modify the epigenome for both long lasting and reversible changes as a novel strategy for combating diseases such as cancer. PROJECT NARRATIVE The epigenome works hand-in-hand with the genome to encode cell phenotypic diversity for multicellular organisms. We will apply interdisciplinary approaches to disentangle the interrelationship between the two, thus elucidating the role of the genome in establishing and maintaining a robust epigenome, and providing mechanistic insight into epigenetic regulations of the genome’s function. Insights from our study will pave the way for rational epigenome engineering which holds great potential for transforming medicine and biotechnology.",From epigenome to genome and back: disentangling the relationship between epigenetic modifications and chromatin organization,10178047,R35GM133580,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Back', 'Biotechnology', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Modeling', 'Chromatin Structure', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Gene Expression', 'Genome', 'Grain', 'Histones', 'Knowledge', 'Length', 'Liquid substance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Nucleosomes', 'Organism', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Work', 'cell type', 'combinatorial', 'deep learning algorithm', 'epigenetic profiling', 'epigenetic regulation', 'epigenome', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'insight', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'reconstruction']",NIGMS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R35,2021,377555
