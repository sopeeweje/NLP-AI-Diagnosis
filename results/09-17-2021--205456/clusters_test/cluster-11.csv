"Leveraging Social Media to Identify and Connect Teens with Eating Disorders to a Mobile Guided Self-Help Mobile Intervention Project Summary Clinical or subclinical eating disorders (EDs) impact 10% of individuals in their lifetime and are marked by significant functional impairment, early mortality, chronicity, and emotional distress. ED symptoms often emerge in adolescence, with peak onset age in the teenage years. Early recognition and treatment of these devastating illnesses are needed to prevent long-term consequences and a chronic course. Most (80%) individuals with EDs, including teens with EDs (TwEDs), do not receive treatment. Due to major barriers to access and to the delivery of treatment for TwEDs, there is a need for a new model of service delivery that can identify and help TwEDs. We have studied ED-related networking on social media and have demonstrated our ability to harness social media, which is used ubiquitously among teens, to identify and efficiently recruit large numbers of TwEDs. At the same time, our team has successfully developed a guided self-help cognitive- behavioral therapy (CBT)-based mobile app, StudentBodies-Eating Disorders (SB-ED), which includes personalized coaching and interactive sessions to address key ED treatment targets and has demonstrated efficacy among college women with EDs. This tool has great potential to be adapted to address the specific needs of TwEDs. In Aim #1 of the proposed study, we will update and adapt SB-ED to create #ByeED for TwEDs by 1) simplifying language and making content relevant to adolescent issues, 2) including a rewards feature to motivate continued app use, 3) including a within-app social networking feature to facilitate group exchanges and coach-led weekly group sessions, and 4) harnessing machine learning to digest users’ social networking data within #ByeED to respond to potential recovery setbacks in real-time and tailor coaching interactions. Following a small focus group of TwEDs to assess initial impressions of the app, #ByeED will be piloted among 20 TwEDs recruited from Instagram, garnering feedback via a mixed methods approach on the efficiency, technical effectiveness, and satisfaction with #ByeED. The app will be further refined for a small pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) in Aim #2, where we will again leverage Instagram for recruitment of TwEDs who are not engaged in treatment. This RCT will approximate the preliminary effectiveness of #ByeED (n=50) versus a control group (encouraging in-person treatment in their communities, n=50) in reducing ED symptoms, improving quality of life, increasing uptake of care, and impacting targets that are associated with outcomes. We will explore within-app predictors of outcomes, potential moderators of treatment effects (e.g., psychiatric comorbidity), and participant perspectives on potential additional parental involvement in #ByeED. Effect size and attrition estimates will aid in the planning of a larger RCT (R01 mechanism) where we will further expand #ByeED (e.g., automated coaching, parental involvement) and test the app on a larger scale to improve its potential to reduce the extraordinary burden of EDs among teens. Relevance to Public Health Eating disorders often emerge in adolescence and most of these teens do not receive treatment. We will use social media to reach teens networking about eating disorder behaviors and test a mobile app specifically developed for teens, including a social networking component, to help reduce eating disorder symptoms and improve their quality of life. We will also obtain teen perspectives on acceptable approaches to include parents in this intervention to inform a future version of the app.",Leveraging Social Media to Identify and Connect Teens with Eating Disorders to a Mobile Guided Self-Help Mobile Intervention,10085684,R34MH119170,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Age of Onset', 'Anxiety', 'Body Image', 'Body Weight', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Communities', 'Consent', 'Control Groups', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Eating', 'Eating Disorders', 'Effectiveness', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health Technology', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health Services', 'Methods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Service delivery model', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Network', 'Suicide attempt', 'Symptoms', 'Teenagers', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Update', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Weight', 'Woman', 'acceptability and feasibility', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'behavior test', 'college', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'dietary', 'digital health', 'disorder risk', 'emotional distress', 'functional disability', 'high risk', 'impression', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'interest', 'mHealth', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mobile application', 'mortality', 'outcome prediction', 'outreach', 'parental involvement', 'preference', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'recruit', 'reduced food intake', 'response', 'restraint', 'satisfaction', 'secondary outcome', 'self help', 'service delivery', 'social media', 'social stigma', 'tool', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment effect', 'uptake']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R34,2021,232006
"Neural Mechanisms of Social Communication in Parrots PROJECT SUMMARY When Confucius said, “Tell me who are your friends, and I’ll tell you who you are,” he was noticing that how we behave and communicate is shaped by who we choose to hang out with every day. We constantly mimic the mannerisms and behaviors of friends and loved ones. Yet the neural basis of how we imitate, and more importantly who we choose to emulate and why, is largely unknown. Parrots provide a powerful yet untapped model system for social learning. Parrots, like humans and non-human primates, live in a specific type of ‘fission- fusion’ social network in which making and maintaining friendships is the key to fitness. Like humans, they selectively imitate and learn the names of their carefully selected companions. Here we aim to launch parrots as a new animal model in systems neuroscience. In aims 1, we will record neural activity in the vocal motor cortical output of the song system (nucleus AAC) in pairs of budgerigars engaged in courtship interactions. In these first- ever neural recordings form awake, behaving parrots, we are finding that AAC neurons exhibit premotor signals for vocalizations (as expected) and for expressive gestures such as silent kissing, head-bobbing and allogrooming. This joint vocal and gestural neural control, observed in human Broca’s area but not in songbirds – means that what was thought to be a songbird-like ‘song system’ is actually a more general system for social interaction. We next test the causal relationship between song system activity and social behavior. Inactivating AAC during courtship interactions will test if/how vocalizations and gestures degrade or lose their coordination (Aim 2.1). Inactivating frontal or posterior cortical inputs to AAC in bonded pairs will test the songbird-inspired idea that variability and order depend on distinct cortical pathways (Aim 2.2). For each inactivation experiment, a pair of interacting birds is conceptualized as a single dynamical system – and we will use machine learning guided behavioral analysis to quantify how vocalizations and gestures change (or do not) in both the inactivated and non-inactivated partner. Finally, in Aim 3 we will image dopamine (DA) release using fiber photometry and genetically encoded DA sensors. Pilot data demonstrate feasibility of DA imaging in singing birds. These experiments will test for the first time if DA signals, known to evaluate the quality of reward outcomes, similarly evaluate social outcomes. Courtship dynamics are perfect because gestural ‘requests’ to allogroom or ‘kiss’ are rejected or accepted with visually and acoustically obvious ‘consent’ or ‘deny’ signals. Males make hundreds of advances per day and use female feedback to learn – providing natural trial structure, within-session learning, and ‘events’ to which we can align simultaneously recorded male and female DA signals – which may or may not come into alignment as a pair ‘decides’ to bond or not. Budgerigar interactions resemble human conversations – a back-and-forth of vocalizations and gestures that both communicate agonistic or affiliative signals and control vocal learning and partner selection. Together, these experiments will help establish parrots as a new model system in social neuroscience and will ready us for a follow-up R01 submission in two years. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Humans thrive or suffer on the basis of social acceptance and rejection, but little is known about what goes on in the brain during high-stakes social interactions. Here, we will perform the first-ever neural recordings from socializing parrots to test how vocalizations and communicative gestures are coordinated during courtship and how the outcomes of romantic advances are encoded in the dopamine system.",Neural Mechanisms of Social Communication in Parrots,10207958,R34NS121898,"['Accelerometer', 'Acoustics', 'Active Learning', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Assimilations', 'Back', 'Beak', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bilateral', 'Biological Models', 'Birds', 'Brain', 'Broca&apos', 's area', 'Cannulas', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Companions', 'Consent', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Courtship', 'Data', 'Dopamine', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Female', 'Fiber', 'Food', 'Friends', 'Friendships', 'Generations', 'Gestures', 'Grooming', 'Head', 'Human', 'Image', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Melopsittacus', 'Motivation', 'Motor', 'Names', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pair Bond', 'Parakeets', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Photometry', 'Primates', 'Psittacidae', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Publications', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Network', 'Socialization', 'Songbirds', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'System', 'Teenagers', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visual', 'awake', 'base', 'classical conditioning', 'court', 'dopamine system', 'dynamic system', 'experimental study', 'fighting', 'fitness', 'follow-up', 'innovation', 'loved ones', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'microphone', 'motor control', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'neuroregulation', 'neurotransmission', 'nonhuman primate', 'outcome prediction', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensor', 'social', 'social communication', 'social learning', 'social neuroscience', 'sound', 'stereotypy', 'vocal control', 'vocal learning', 'vocalization']",NINDS,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R34,2021,689222
"Neural Encoding of Social Information PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Vocal communication plays a pivotal role in shaping the dynamics of social interactions and is impaired in a wide range of neurological disorders. Consequently, a major component of translational research focuses on identifying circuit-level neurobiological mechanisms underlying social communication deficits. Determining the neural mechanisms underlying social communication deficits requires both understanding the functions of neural circuits as well as the ability to link neural circuits to specific naturalistic behaviors. However, obtaining this information has been challenging because of the difficulties in interpreting complex behavioral interactions in freely socializing animals. The long-term goal of this research is to understand the neural circuitry controlling naturalistic social behaviors directly influenced by communication. This could ultimately allow communication disorders to be treated by therapeutically targeting atypically functioning neural circuitry. In pursuit of this goal, the overall objective in this proposal is to determine how social communication is encoded in the nervous system and the role it plays in shaping behavior. The proposal uses a novel microphone array system to track the vocal behavior of freely socializing, individual adult mice—a technique that has eluded the field for 50 years. Coupling this innovative method with in vivo wireless electrophysiology and machine-learning techniques used for robustly extracting meaningful social information will enable identification of the neural circuits that encode social communication and the role communication plays in directly shaping social behavior. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that mice emit behavior-dependent vocalizations that directly alter the social dynamics between animals. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that behaviorally-dependent vocalizations are encoded in the CA2 subregion of the hippocampus. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that the lateral entorhinal cortex, one of the primary cortical inputs to CA2, encodes the locations of vocalizations in egocentric reference frames. The proposed research will have a broad impact as these studies will provide fundamental insight into the neurobiological basis of social communication. Moreover, these experiments will lay the groundwork for future studies examining the neural basis of social communication in mouse models of neurological disorders, such as schizophrenia, Parkinson’s disease, and autism spectrum disorders. Project Narrative:  Understanding the fundamental principles governing social communication is of paramount importance as deficits in expressive and receptive vocal communication skills are hallmark characteristics of a wide range of neurological disorders. The proposed experiments aim to determine the direct impact of social communication on behavior and delineate how neural circuits encode social communication. Ultimately, knowledge gained from the proposed project has the potential to inform and hasten the discovery of novel therapeutic approaches that will help reduce the burdens of human disability.",Neural Encoding of Social Information,10183334,R01MH122752,"['Acoustics', 'Adult', 'Agonistic Behavior', 'Animal Disease Models', 'Animals', 'Auditory', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Characteristics', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communication impairment', 'Complex', 'Coupling', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Medial', 'Methods', 'Mus', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pattern', 'Pheromone', 'Play', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Interaction', 'Socialization', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Translational Research', 'Wireless Technology', 'affiliative behavior', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'deprivation', 'disability', 'entorhinal cortex', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'free behavior', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mature animal', 'microphone', 'mouse model', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'social communication', 'sound', 'source localization', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'vocalization']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE,R01,2021,618061
"Resilience, cultural alignment, and social support in brain aging: Data from the Strong Heart Study ABSTRACT When life stresses are especially intense, chronic, or overwhelming, deleterious health effects can occur, including inflammation, cardiovascular disease, disability, depression, low quality of life, and dementia. In this context, resilience can be defined as the ability to maintain a healthy aging trajectory despite adverse conditions of stress. American Indians (AI) have a unique history and ongoing experience of trauma and disparities in environmental and socioeconomic conditions, which amplify daily stresses and contribute to health risks. Despite these adverse circumstances, remarkable resilience has been described in AI populations. Recent work by our group suggests that social support and alignment with Native culture correlate with lower levels of stress, negativity, anger, hostility, depression, mortality, and cardiovascular disease. However, our findings on cultural alignment are limited, and none has yet explored associations of resilience and social support. It remains an open question whether neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) can result from chronic stress, or whether individual psychosocial characteristics such as resilience can mediate such risk. We propose to address these knowledge gaps by efficiently leveraging an existing effort funded by the NHLBI in the Strong Heart Study, a longitudinal cohort of AI adults from 13 tribal communities across the US. The existing contract covers recruitment, consenting, and basic clinical examination of 3,000 eligible participants in 2022-2024; we propose to augment the limited protocol by administering additional psychosocial and neuropsychological instruments on resilience, social support, cultural identity and alignment, and cognition. Our Specific Aims are to: describe associations of individual resilience among AI adults with identity and self-regard, social support, and cultural alignment, by age and sex; evaluate resilience, social support, and cultural features in relation to ADRD; and use machine learning to develop explanatory models of resilience and dementia. Our study has the potential to advance epidemiologic knowledge of modifiable psychosocial conditions in a vulnerable, underserved population, and consequently to offer a clearer picture of the relative contributions of psychosocial, behavioral, interpersonal, and socioeconomic factors related to ADRD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic stress can result in negative health effects, including inflammation, cardiovascular disease, and Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD); American Indian (AI) populations have endured excess stresses and traumas, but have also shown remarkable psychosocial resilience, which may be related to robust social support, community environment, cultural identity. It is unclear which of these psychosocial features may be most predictive of psychosocial resilience in AI adults, or whether any is protective against neurodegeneration and ADRD. A search on NIH Reporter uncovered many projects focused on cognitive reserve—sometimes also called resilience—but none on psychosocial resilience or its related features as protective health characteristics in adult AIs. This project seeks to fill this knowledge gap with novel data collection and analysis on trait-based psychosocial resilience, related features, cognitive function, and ADRD in 3000 adult AIs as part of the ongoing Strong Heart Study.","Resilience, cultural alignment, and social support in brain aging: Data from the Strong Heart Study",10264169,R01AG070822,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'American Indians', 'Anger', 'Anthropology', 'Behavioral', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic stress', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Consent', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Family', 'Female', 'Funding', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Hostility', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Life Stress', 'Link', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Medical Genetics', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Navajo', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient-Centered Care', 'Persons', 'Philosophy', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Social Network', 'Social support', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Spirituality', 'Stress', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Tribes', 'Underserved Population', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'Youth', 'aging brain', 'base', 'bullying', 'clinical examination', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive reserve', 'cohort', 'disability', 'eligible participant', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'healthy aging', 'heterogenous data', 'improved', 'instrument', 'intergenerational', 'male', 'mortality', 'novel', 'optimism', 'practical application', 'psychosocial', 'public health intervention', 'recruit', 'resilience', 'screening', 'sex', 'sociodemographics', 'socioeconomics', 'theories', 'trait', 'tribal community']",NIA,WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,590213
"Role of the Hippocampal-mPFC Pathway in Social Memory Deficits in Autism PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The hippocampus is critical for the formation and consolidation of spatial memories and contributes to other cognitive tasks through its efferent projections. The goal of this project is to determine whether altered neuronal network activity in the hippocampus of an autism mouse model propagates to, and alters distal cortical regions involved in social behaviors.  One of the core symptoms of autism spectrum disorders, such as Rett syndrome (RTT), is a deficit in social interaction. In mice, similar social behavior impairments can be modeled by altering the excitation and inhibition (E/I) balance in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). For RTT, knocking out the gene that is mutated in humans, Mecp2, causes hyperactivity in the ventral hippocampus (vHIP) due to an E/I imbalance driven by impaired inhibition and enhanced excitation, resulting in saturated synaptic plasticity at excitatory synapses. Intriguingly, CA1 pyramidal neurons of the vHIP project their axons to the mPFC, making direct monosynaptic connections with excitatory pyramidal neurons and inhibitory interneurons. We propose to characterize how the vHIP influences mPFC activity through this long-range monosynaptic glutamatergic projection. Importantly, we will test whether altered vHIP network activity is causal to mPFC dysfunction and deficits in social interaction. We hypothesize that atypically strong vHIP afferents alter network activity in the mPFC of Mecp2 KO mice by affecting the E/I balance and synaptic plasticity, which in turn contributes to social interaction deficits. To test this hypothesis, we will identify the cellular targets of direct vHIP afferents in the mPFC of RTT mice and characterize their function in social behaviors using a combination of optogenetics, chemogenetics, ex vivo and in vivo electrophysiology and Ca2+ imaging, anterograde and retrograde tract tracing, and unbiased machine-learning behavioral assessments.  We propose the following Specific Aims: 1) identify and characterize the cellular targets of the monosynaptic projection from the vHIP to the mPFC in Mecp2 KO mice; 2) characterize long-term synaptic plasticity of the vHIP-mPFC projection in Mecp2 KO mice; and 3) determine if chemogenetic modulation of the activity of mPFC-projecting vHIP neurons alters mPFC function and social behaviors.  These studies will provide fundamental information on the functional and structural properties of the long- range connection between the vHIP and mPFC in the developing brain. The impact of this work extends beyond RTT to other neuropsychiatric disorders in which propagation of network dysfunction from the hippocampus to the mPFC is believed to contribute to cognitive deficits. PROJECT NARRATIVE Rett syndrome is a syndromic autism-spectrum disorder that presents with deficits in social behaviors and cognitive abilities, which may result from impaired function of the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. The proposed study is the first characterization of a long-range monosynaptic connection in Rett mice using optogenetics and chemogenetics, and will test whether hippocampal hyperactivity propagates to the medial prefrontal cortex, leading to autism-related social deficits.",Role of the Hippocampal-mPFC Pathway in Social Memory Deficits in Autism,10087555,R01MH118563,"['Affect', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Contralateral', 'Distal', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Equilibrium', 'Excitatory Synapse', 'Fiber', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Image', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Impairment', 'Interneurons', 'Knock-out', 'Knockout Mice', 'Label', 'Link', 'Long-Term Depression', 'Long-Term Potentiation', 'Machine Learning', 'Medial', 'Membrane', 'Memory impairment', 'Methyl-CpG-Binding Protein 2', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Opsin', 'Pathway interactions', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Property', 'Rett Syndrome', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Interaction', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Potentials', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavioral impairment', 'cellular targeting', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive task', 'designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs', 'experimental study', 'hippocampal pyramidal neuron', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'mouse model', 'network dysfunction', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'postnatal development', 'response', 'social', 'social deficits', 'spatial memory', 'voltage sensitive dye']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R01,2021,393603
"A data-driven approach to identify the neural and cognitive basis of social functioning in health and first episode psychosis Project Summary/Abstract: The research and training plan for this Fellowship will provide the applicant with significant and foundational training in cognitive neuroscience, advanced computational approaches and neuroimaging analysis to support her long-term career goal of becoming an independent researcher dedicated to enhancing functional recovery in schizophrenia. A core feature of schizophrenia is severe disability in social functioning, which places a high burden on individuals and society. Effective treatment development for social functioning deficits is hindered by the lack of well-defined neural and cognitive treatment targets. Recent advances suggest cortical loss in prefrontal and cingulate cortices may be linked to poor functioning in chronic schizophrenia, however the relationship between specific neural targets and social functioning in first episode psychosis (FEP), when individuals may have greater ability to engage in substantial recovery, is largely unknown. Further, social cognition deficits are strongly linked to poor functioning, but the relationship between cortical loss in social cognitive brain regions and social functioning remains to be established. The purpose of this study is to employ data-driven approaches to identify neural and social cognitive markers of social functioning in health and FEP to inform treatment target identification. This cross-sectional, secondary analysis leverages two unique datasets – a large sample of healthy young adults from the Human Connectome Project (n=1113), and a sample of FEP participants enrolled in an ongoing clinical trial at the University of Minnesota (n=40). Specific Aim 1 - examine the relationships between gray matter volume and cortical thickness, social cognition and social functioning in healthy young adults using data driven approaches - will answer two research questions: 1a) what brain regions estimate better social functioning in healthy young adults, using regression-based machine learning analysis? and 1b) Is the relationship between social functioning and measures of gray matter volume and cortical thickness mediated by social cognition? We will then translate these findings to an FEP sample in Aim 2 - characterize the relationship between gray matter volume and cortical thickness and social functioning in FEP. This research will be supported by the applicant’s comprehensive training plan, her interdisciplinary mentoring team, and an ideal training environment due to its sophisticated neuroimaging and health informatics resources. This research is expected to advance our understanding of the complex relationships between the brain, social cognition and social functioning, which could lead to more targeted interventions for functional deficits in schizophrenia, alleviating suffering and addressing a critical public health need. The training will position the applicant to continue her trajectory to an independent career in translational cognitive neuroscience to enhance functional recovery through the development of neuroscience-informed interventions. Project Narrative: This research will identify relationships between neural substrate, social cognition and social functioning in healthy and first episode psychosis samples in order to identify the bio-behavioral processes that support social functioning and to identify potential neural treatment targets for improving social functioning deficits in psychotic disorders. This research aligns with the National Institute of Mental Health priority of elucidating the neural processes of complex behaviors to inform novel treatments. Identification of treatment biomarkers for social functioning is critical in order to advance treatment development and optimization for functional deficits in psychosis that will result in significant public health impact by reducing disability and promoting quality of life for individuals with schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders.",A data-driven approach to identify the neural and cognitive basis of social functioning in health and first episode psychosis,10153037,F31MH124278,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caregivers', 'Chronic Schizophrenia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Emotions', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Fellowship', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Priorities', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Interpersonal Relations', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Participant', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Quality of life', 'Reaction Time', 'Recovery', 'Recovery of Function', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resource Informatics', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Social Development', 'Social Functioning', 'Social support', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'aged', 'base', 'biobehavior', 'career', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive training', 'connectome', 'disability', 'effective therapy', 'first episode psychosis', 'gray matter', 'improved', 'insight', 'instrument', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'secondary analysis', 'social', 'social cognition', 'social relationships', 'theories', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy development', 'treatment optimization', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,F31,2021,41879
"Social Processing Deficits in Remitted Adolescent Depression Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of disability worldwide and has a peak onset during adolescence. While interventions are moderately effective for many adolescents, 40 to 70% will relapse within 5 years. Further, MDD relapse predicts academic difficulties, risky behaviors, and suicide. Thus, identifying mechanisms of MDD relapse is critical to clarify intervention targets for this significant public health problem.  During adolescence, social processes and dynamics (especially with peers) are particularly significant, although it is unclear which social processes are most critical to MDD relapse. The present study focuses on the role of social communication, a set of mechanisms involving the receiving and delivery of socially relevant information. Social communication is especially significant to adolescents, as maladaptive social communication can negatively impact the establishment and maintenance of relationships, thus increasing risk for MDD relapse.  For the proposed study, we will employ an NIMH’s Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) lens and use multiple measures (behavior, event-related potentials [ERPs], eye tracking) to compare adolescents (aged 14-17 years) with remitted depression (remMDD; N=200) to healthy controls (HC; N=100) on deficits in several aspects of social communication, including: (i) processing of nonverbal social information, (ii) processing of socioemotional feedback, and (iii) digital communication. First, Aim 1 will test whether remMDD adolescents abnormally process two types of nonverbal social information—facial expressions (as indexed by reduced accuracy and abnormal ERPs [i.e., the N170]) and hand gesturing behaviors (assessed via eye-tracking). Second, Aim 2 will test whether remMDD adolescents abnormally process socioemotional feedback (being accepted versus rejected by same-aged peers), a well-established trigger of adolescent MDD. Specifically, Aim 2 will test whether remMDD adolescents exhibit a reduced Late Positive Potential [LPP]), an ERP indexing emotional encoding, following positive social feedback from faux peers during a peer evaluation task. Third, using an innovative smartphone app, Aim 3 will collect multiple indicators of digital communication regarding the structure of adolescents’ digital social network (i.e., size of the network; frequency of communication) and sentiment of the communication with their digital social network (i.e., coding sentiment from their texts, social media posts); allowing us to test whether remMDD adolescents exhibit abnormal digital communication. Last, we will follow adolescents for 1-year to determine whether processing of nonverbal information, social feedback, and digital communication predict the escalation of depression symptoms and MDD relapse. Further, supervised machine learning will explore which social communication deficit(s) predict symptoms or MDD relapse, and whether these social processes predict outcomes independent of (or interaction with) other established predictors of relapse (e.g., stressful life events). In summary, the project has the promise to identify social process that contribute to recurrent depression, which, ultimately, will lead to innovative treatment approaches. Project Narrative Depression in adolescence is common and recurrent. While social processes and dynamics are particularly significant in adolescence, it is unclear which social processes are most critical to depression relapse.

"The Pathophysiological Role of Cerebellar Glia in Rett Syndrome PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Rett  syndrome  (RTT)  is  the  leading  cause  of  severe  intellectual  disability  in  girls  and  women.  Individuals  with  RTT  develop  typically  until  6-­18  months,  when  autism-­like  behaviors  and  deficits  in  purposeful  hand  use  and  speech start to develop. Loss-­of-­function mutations in the transcriptional regulator methyl-­CpG-­binding protein   2  (MECP2)  occur  in  >95%  of  RTT  cases.  Initially,  researchers  regarded  MeCP2  deficiency  in  neurons  as  the  exclusive  cause  of  RTT.  However,  recent  studies  have  revealed  that  glia  have  a  pathological  role  in  RTT  etiology. Studies have not yet uncovered the underlying cellular mechanisms of glial cell dysfunction in Mecp2  rodent  models  or  the  impact  of  this  dysfunction  on  brain  function.  In  this  study,  we  propose  to  examine  the  contribution  of  a  specific  glial  subtype,  Bergmann  glia  cells  (BGs)  in  the  cerebellum,  to  the  motor  and  social  deficits  in  RTT.  We  will  focus  on  BGs  because  (1)  cerebellar  disruption  likely  contributes  to  the  motor  and  social  deficits  in  RTT  and  (2)  BGs  are  the  major  glial  subtype  in  the  cerebellum.  We  propose  to  characterize  cerebellar  function  in  conditional  knockout  (cKO)  mice  that  lack  Mecp2  in  BGs  using  a  repertoire  of  approaches,  including  intracellular  whole-­cell  recordings,  in  vivo  recordings  of  single  units  and  local  field  potentials,  in  vivo  and  ex  vivo  imaging  of  genetically-­encoded  Ca2+,  glutamate,  and  dopamine  (DA)  sensors  (GCaMP7,  iGluSnFr,  and  dLight1.1,  respectively),  optogenetics,  chemogenetics,  near  super-­resolution  confocal  microscopy,  and  behavioral  assessments  using  unbiased  machine-­learning  approaches.  Our  preliminary results indicate deficits in BGs from Mecp2-­deficient mice, including higher expression levels of the  GluA1  subunit  of  AMPA  receptors  (AMPARs),  and  depolarized  membrane  potentials.  In  addition,  we  have  preliminary evidence of DAergic modulation of BGs through the activation of D1 receptors (D1Rs) activated by  either electrical or optogenetic stimulation of DAergic inputs to the cerebellum. Of high relevance to motor and  social symptoms in RTT, the expression levels of D1Rs, which modulate GluA1 surface insertion, are higher in  Mecp2  KO  mice.  We  hypothesize  that  BGs  in  the  cerebellum  have  a  pathophysiological  role  in  motor  and  social  deficits  in  Mecp2-­deficient  mice.  We  propose  two  Aims:  (1)  Define  cerebellar  BG  dysfunction  in  Mecp2  cKO  mice;;  (2)  Characterize  DAergic  modulation  of  cerebellar  BGs  in  Mecp2  cKO  mice.  The  proposed  studies  will elucidate the consequences of impaired DAergic modulation of astrocyte function on cerebellar-­dependent  behaviors,  which  will  have  broad  implications  not  only  for  RTT  but  also  for  other  brain  disorders  associated  with cerebellar dysfunction.     PROJECT NARRATIVE Rett syndrome (RTT), caused by MECP2 mutations, presents with stereotypic hand movements, ambulatory difficulties, and social impairments.

"Feeding interaction network analyses enhance management of NHP breeding groups Abstract A primary mission of Animal Resources Divisions at National Primate Research Centers (NPRC) is to maintain the overall social health of Indian-origin rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) living in large multi-generational breeding groups in order to ensure the availability of high-quality research subjects for NIH-funded research. The social dynamics of these breeding groups, however, are complex and disturbances in their dominance hierarchy and kinship structures can lead to increased aggression and fighting that may result in significant wounding. Thus, a common challenge in their management is the utilization of effective social heath surveillance methodology to identify groups at risk for social instability before the onset of significant fighting. These captive groups are routinely monitored for changes in dominance ranks and rates of trauma to detect social instability at the family- and group-level; however, the precise timing of severe outbreaks of aggression is largely considered unpredictable. Further, the frequency of interactions that define dominance and affiliative relationships in these groups are sparse; thus, the gathering of enough behavioral data to unequivocally detect social instability is time- consuming. We recently published a report that indicated automated feeding data can provide critical real-time data and assist management with monitoring social stability in rhesus macaque breeding groups, by possibly predicting the timing of intense aggression. The purpose of this proposal is to expand upon these observations by establishing data-driven models that help management identify groups at risk for social instability. Because automated feeding data include precise timestamps and the order in which animals feed, network analyses can be used to construct Feeding Interaction Networks (FINs), allowing us to examine patterns of temporal proximity feeding among kin and non-kin. Because reproductive status also influences food intake in female monkeys, we will study six outdoor breeding groups at the Yerkes NPRC across the breeding and birthing seasons, and integrate social and reproductive data, with the overarching aim to develop comprehensive data-driven FIN models that will enhance colony management practices of NIH-supported rhesus macaque breeding colonies. Aim 1 will characterize the community structures within static FINs of rhesus macaque breeding groups, varying in size and composition. Aim 2 will determine whether the directionality and strength of connections between adult females within a static FIN can be used to predict patterns of affiliative and dominance relationships among kin and non-kin. Aim 3 will quantify and model the temporal changes of community structures within dynamic FINs of rhesus macaque groups across the breeding and birthing season with respect to female reproductive phase. Finally, Aim 4 will detect changes in the community structures of dynamic FINs, not associated with reproductive seasonality, that are precursor to increased aggression and other signs of social instability. These FIN models will be used to supplement behavioral and trauma data, allowing management to identify groups at risk for social instability and develop strategies to intervene prior to the escalation of additional aggression. Narrative The primary goal of this project is to use network analyses to construct a Feeding Interaction Network using automated feeding data collected from animals living in large breeding groups at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center. If successful, these models will identify groups at risk for social instability before the onset of fighting and injury. The application of automated feeding data in the social management of captive colonies of rhesus macaques represents a paradigm shift from more conventional practices.",Feeding interaction network analyses enhance management of NHP breeding groups,10090122,R24OD030035,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Animal Feed', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Birth', 'Breeding', 'Case Study', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Eating', 'Ensure', 'Estradiol', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'Female', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Injury', 'Intake', 'Lactation', 'Lead', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Monkeys', 'Ovulation', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Practice Management', 'Primates', 'Progesterone', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Subjects', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Dominance', 'Social Network', 'Social support', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'affiliative behavior', 'animal resource', 'behavior observation', 'cohesion', 'feeding', 'fighting', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'network models', 'pregnant', 'reproductive', 'season of birth', 'social', 'social attachment', 'social relationships', 'social unrest', 'wound']",OD,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R24,2021,802738
"Pragmatics to Reveal Intention in Social Media (PRISM) for Health Promotion Abstract: The effects of social relationships on management of health behaviors and adoption of positive wellness regimens has been well documented. In the era of digital and participatory health communication, the role of social ties in health promotion has become more complex. Online communities, which digitize peer-to-peer communication, provide a unique opportunity to researchers to understand collective social mechanisms as well as individual factors underlying human behavior change. Most studies of online and offline social networks have not considered the dynamics among communication intent and content with social influence. In the proposed research, we will develop a multi-dimensional methodological framework for social intercourse analysis to leverage the rich and voluminous data provided by online communities. Our framework aims to incorporate and integrate communication intent, semantics and structure of online communication to study sociobehavioral factors of health behaviors and chronic disease management, While our methods will be generally applicable, we will develop them in the context of health-related communication between members of online communities, particularly focusing on smoking cessation and diabetes management. This research proposal will result in- 1) new theoretical frameworks that describe the communication domain in a online social setting for behavior change, 2) scalable techniques to model expressions, semantics, and social dependencies associated self- reported health outcomes, and 3) new proposals for the development of data-driven sociobehavioral interventions to support individuals engaging in positive health behavior changes and chronic disease management. Project Narrative: This project enables retrospective analysis of social intercourse to facilitate our understanding of the associations between communication (content, intent, structure) and social influence dynamics underlying behavior change and chronic disease management as manifested in health-related member communication of online communities. As a component of the proposed research, we will integrate methods of discourse analysis, automated text analysis, and dynamic network models to analyze electronically captured peer-to-peer communication and characterize communication intent and content at scale. By enabling deeper analysis of communication in online platforms, resulting research can help achieve superior personalization of healthy living technologies and campaigns in offline and online formats.",Pragmatics to Reveal Intention in Social Media (PRISM) for Health Promotion,10199050,R01LM012974,"['Adoption', 'Affect', 'Automation', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Communication', 'Communications Media', 'Communities', 'Community Health', 'Complex', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Discourse analysis', 'Disease Management', 'Education', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Campaign', 'Health Communication', 'Health Promotion', 'Health behavior', 'Health behavior change', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intention', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Public Health', 'Readiness', 'Recommendation', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Role', 'Self Efficacy', 'Self-Direction', 'Semantics', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Network', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Work', 'behavior change', 'convolutional neural network', 'design', 'diabetes management', 'digital', 'experience', 'health management', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'network models', 'nicotine patch', 'online community', 'peer', 'psychosocial', 'role model', 'smoking cessation', 'social', 'social media', 'social relationships', 'supervised learning', 'virtual coach']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2021,343235
"Regulation of social aggression through hippocampal CA2 inputs to lateral septum Heightened levels of social aggression, a motivated behavior, are often associated with neuropsychiatric disease. Although our understanding of the neural mechanisms regulating aggression is incomplete, both lateral septum (LS) and ventral hypothalamus are known to be important. Even though LS receives one of its strongest inputs from hippocampus, a region important for declarative memory, little is known about how hippocampus regulates aggression. Moreover, as hippocampus is implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders associated with altered social behavior and aggression, a basic understanding of how hippocampus and its circuitry regulate aggression will likely yield important new insights into disease mechanisms.  Here we focus on the role of the hippocampal CA2 region in social aggression. Relatively little is known about CA2, largely because of technical problems that limit its study with conventional lesioning approaches. We therefore developed a Cre mouse line that enables us to label and manipulate the activity of CA2 pyramidal neurons. Using a genetic silencing approach, we found that CA2 was critical during non-aggressive social exploration for the formation of social memory, the ability of an animal to recognize and remember another mouse (conspecific), but CA2 was not needed for other forms of hippocampal memory. Our recent results now show that CA2 also promotes social aggression, through an excitatory projection to LS that disinhibits a subnucleus in ventral medial hypothalamus important for aggression. Moreover, we find that the social neuropeptide arginine vasopressin promotes aggression by enhancing the CA2 to LS synapse.  Here we ask: How does a single brain region, CA2, participate in social memory storage during non- aggressive social exploration and promote social aggression? Is there a single population of CA2 neurons that is activated during both social exploration and social aggression? Or are there specialist neurons for each behavior? Does CA2 actively encode distinct representations of social exploration and social aggression, or does CA2 encode a single social salience signal that does not in itself encode aggression but that is gated by the internal state of an animal to promote aggression through CA2 inputs to LS? We will test the hypothesis that vasopressin release in LS acts as such a permissive gate. As vasopressin also enhances social memory by acting within CA2, we will ask: How can a single neuromodulator produce two such distinct actions? Do distinct sources of vasopressin input to CA2 and LS promote, respectively, social memory and aggression?  We will address these questions by characterizing CA2 circuits and neural activity during aggressive and non-aggressive social interactions using: 1. Activity-dependent genetic marking of active CA2 ensembles; 2. Electrophysiological characterization of CA2?LS circuits and their regulation by vasopressin in ex vivo brain slices; 3. Behavioral control of aggression using chemogenetics and optogenetics; and 4. In vivo optical and electrophysiological recordings of CA2 activity during non-aggressive and aggressive social interactions. Many neuropsychiatric disorders are associated with increased levels of aggression, which impair patient care and place a burden on society. Here we will examine the neural mechanisms by which the CA2 region of the hippocampus, a relatively unexplored brain region implicated in social memory and schizophrenia, regulates aggressive behavior in mice.",Regulation of social aggression through hippocampal CA2 inputs to lateral septum,10226105,R01MH120292,"['Address', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animals', 'Argipressin', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Genetic', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Immediate-Early Genes', 'Impairment', 'Label', 'Lateral', 'Lesion', 'Locales', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Middle Hypothalamus', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neuromodulator', 'Neurons', 'Neuropeptides', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Patient Care', 'Play', 'Population', 'Presynaptic Terminals', 'Regulation', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Interaction', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Synapses', 'Testing', 'Vasopressins', 'anatomical tracing', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'experimental study', 'extracellular', 'hippocampal pyramidal neuron', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'maternal aggression', 'motivated behavior', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'presynaptic', 'receptor', 'relating to nervous system', 'selective expression', 'social', 'tool']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,462162
"Dynamics of Large-Scale Networks During Emotional and Social Processing The goal of this application is to develop a research program that, as stated in the call entitled The Neural Mechanisms of Multi-Dimensional Emotional and Social Representation (RFA-MH- 17-300), incorporates innovative approaches designed to move the fields of affective and social neuroscience beyond single region-based, modular, and static models of brain function and behavior. The RFA calls for research that is multi-dimensional, that is, that investigates the role of (among others) complex contexts, as well as distributed and/or dynamic processes that unfold over time. The objective of the present application is to jointly investigate emotional and social processes in a richly multi-dimensional manner. Aim 1: Network organization and evolution during emotional and social processing. The objective of this aim is to uncover how large-scale brain networks are organized and evolve temporally during emotional and social processing. Networks will include brain regions that robustly respond to the tasks proposed, and regions from well characterized networks, including the salience, executive control, and task-negative networks. Aim 2: Naturalistic processing during emotional and social processing. The objective of this aim is to understand naturalistic processing of emotional and social information. Although standard experimental designs afford great control over experimental conditions, they lack ecological validity and restrict the experiments that can be studied. We propose to investigate continuous (“naturalistic”) processing during movie watching involving emotional and social content. Continuous processing will be investigated via intersubject correlation analysis, which measures the extent to which signals are correlated across participants. Aim 3: Development of network organization/evolution and naturalistic processing. The objective of this aim is to investigate multi-dimensional emotional and social processes from a developmental perspective. Most developmental research in emotion has focused on observing amygdala responses and those of a few other brain regions during face perception. We focus on a question largely neglected in prior research, specifically sustained threat processing and the involvement of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. In the context of social processing, this aim examines the development of intersubject synchrony. Across the emotional and social domains, we propose to study middle childhood (8-9 y), early adolescence (12-13 y), and young adulthood (18-19 y). The goal of this application is to investigate the neural mechanisms of multi-dimensional emotional and social representation. Functional MRI experiments are proposed to investigate the following general questions: organization and evolution of brain networks; naturalistic processing during movie watching; and development.",Dynamics of Large-Scale Networks During Emotional and Social Processing,10120523,R01MH112517,"['Adolescence', 'Adopted', 'Affective', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Process', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Evolution', 'Experimental Designs', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'Participant', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Persons', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Development', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Processes', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Structure of terminal stria nuclei of preoptic region', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'affective neuroscience', 'age group', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'design', 'early adolescence', 'executive function', 'experimental study', 'face perception', 'graph theory', 'improved', 'innovation', 'middle childhood', 'movie', 'neglect', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'peer', 'positive mood', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'social', 'social neuroscience', 'young adult']",NIMH,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2021,584996
"Conception Failure and Pregnancy Loss in the U.S. NEW EVIDENCE ON CONCEPTION AND PREGNANCY LOSS IN THE U.S. ABSTRACT Conception failure and pregnancy loss impede the pathway to parenthood for millions of US couples each year. Despite being modifiable and common—pregnancy loss occurs fifty times as often as infant mortality— miscarriage is among the least well-studied aspects of population health or population dynamics. We know little about what causes these losses, the generalizability of estimates generated from the study of small recruited samples, including how the risk of miscarriage differs across time, place, or subpopulation.  These enormous gaps are driven by how difficult it is to study the pathway to live birth in humans, requiring a sufficiently large and diverse “preconception cohort.” To date small, nonrepresentative cohorts contribute most of what we know about early pregnancy. But limited sample size, variation, and coverage preclude the study of social and ecological factors—poverty, partner health, environmental exposures—that are now widely understood to shape mortality at later ages: e.g., stillbirth, infant, and child mortality. Such omissions are consequential. Conception failures and pregnancy loss have significant emotional and economic costs. Though pregnancy failures are likely distributed unevenly across populations, the size of this disparate burden is unknown. We do not have evidence about the potential impact of policies on the prevention of these outcomes.  Our research combines the tools of data science and social science to scale the preconception design to a large, diverse cohort in the US. Period and pregnancy “tracking” on digital devices is now common among reproductive-age women. We use data on 4 million women’s day-to-day recording of menstrual cycles, ovulation, and pregnancy, as well as reported social and economic characteristics. The data allow us to measure both reported and detected conception and pregnancy loss. We combine the data with georeferenced information about the physical, social, economic, and policy environments in which women and their partners live. The sample is diverse: users come from over 99% of U.S. counties; over 1 million users are on Medicaid. We use these extraordinary data to provide the first estimates of large-scale population variability in the pathway to live birth and to document factors that affect this pathway. Aim 1 develops new estimates of conception and pregnancy loss, including disparities associated with education, income, racial identification, and neighborhood poverty. Aim 2 estimates the contribution of male partner characteristics to conception and pregnancy loss, drawing on detailed data reported about partners. Aim 3 uses quasi-experimental designs to provide the first estimates of understudied exposures from multiple environmental, social, economic domains on conception and pregnancy loss. The research sheds new light on a pervasive and massively understudied public health concern, with direct implications for the improvement of early pregnancy outcomes. In so doing, the research also generates estimates that are much-needed inputs to support advancement in multiple, connected fields of study in the social, health, and biomedical sciences. NARRATIVE Conception failure and miscarriage affect millions of U.S. couples each year.

"Microdata for Analysis of Early Life Conditions, Health, and Population Project Summary This project will enhance and develop the only source of data that provides core information about work, education, income, and migration for the entire U.S. population. This unique resource allows us to observe today's late-life population when they were young. This allows a prospective view of the impact of early-life environments and socioeconomic status on health and well-being in later life. The massive database describes the characteristics of all 133 million persons who resided in the United States in 1940. The data have been available for only a brief period, but are already having a profound impact on scientific research. They are the primary data source for at least 19 sponsored projects, including nine funded by NIH and seven funded by NSF. Through May 2017, 104 investigators had produced 95 papers based on the data, including 22 articles, four books, three PhD dissertations, and 66 working papers. This project will improve the quality and usability of the database by correcting transcription errors; improving the coding, editing, and allocation of key variables; and introducing new data dissemination tools designed to simplify access to the data. The project will undertake three major activities to meet these objectives. 1. Incorporate new verified census information on name, age, sex, family relationship, race, marital status,  birthplace, and residence five years ago. 2. Improve coding, editing, and allocation for geographic variables, migration, occupation, and numerically-  coded variables such as income. 3. Apply new technologies to democratize access to the data through new data access tools and a virtual data  enclave for a restricted version of the data that contains names. This project is a highly cost-effective use of scarce resources to develop shared infrastructure for research, education, and policy-making on health and aging. The proposed improvement of data quality is urgent, and will provide a resource of unprecedented power for understanding the effects of public policies, social institutions, and environmental conditions on the health, well-being, and functioning of people, both over the life course and in their later years.

The first phase of research (conducted during the K phase, alongside training activities) is a comparative study examining social and cultural factors involved in perceptions of ethical issues among members of industry. The comparative study focuses on three biotech hubs in the US (the Bay Area, San Diego, and Boston), as well as an additional site in South Africa (Cape Town). The South African site helps place investigation of the US industry in light of a shifting global industry, and especially South Africa’s policy focus on genomics for population health (as well as its role in the H3Africa initiative). The study also considers industry subsector and individual company culture, in examining influences on industry approaches to social and ethical issues. During its R phase, the project then involves a systematic normative analysis of profit and social obligation in the genomics industry, based on key theories from bioethics and business ethics. The project will then feed this scholarly analysis back to industry stakeholders; using a Delphi study, it allows members of industry to use results of the normative analysis in strategizing interventions with the greatest likelihood of influencing the genomics industry in ethically desirable ways. This project addresses the NHGRI ELSI research priorities of genomic equity and social justice, as well as genomics and public health. Its career development plan focuses on training in normative analysis and Delphi methods, as well as content training in genomics and entrepreneurship. The training will be conducted at Johns Hopkins University, where the school’s preeminent bioethics center houses world experts in qualitative and quantitative empirical bioethics, alongside the University’s leading research and training in the biomedical sciences and their application in industry. The integrated research and training plan will prepare the candidate as an independent ELSI scholar with a rigorous research program focused on empirical and normative analysis of the business of biomedicine and genomics, and engagement with industry stakeholders. This Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00) investigates and leverages perspectives from members of the health-related private sector genomics industry, to develop guidance for improving approaches to social and ethical issues in the industry. It does so through in-depth qualitative analysis (interviews, cases studies, comparative analysis), scholarly normative analysis (drawing on theories from bioethics and business ethics), and a Delphi process of iterative questionnaires with industry stakeholders, aimed at strategizing concrete change regarding social obligations of the industry. The research and training program is designed to contribute to a more just distribution of the benefits of genomic technologies.",Organizational and Cultural Dynamics in Genomics Companies: Industry Engagement in Navigating Social and Ethical Issues,10307826,R00HG010499,"['Address', 'Agreement', 'American', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Back', 'Bioethics', 'Bioethics Consultants', 'Biotechnology', 'Boston', 'Businesses', 'California', 'Case Study', 'Comparative Study', 'Complement', 'Corporate Ethics', 'DNA', 'Decision Making', 'Delphi Study', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnostic', 'Empirical Research', 'Employee', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Ethical Issues', 'Ethics', 'Face', 'Genetic', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Health', 'Health Technology', 'India', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Industry', 'Inequality', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Justice', 'Licensing', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Price', 'Privacy', 'Private Enterprises', 'Private Sector', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Role', 'Scholarship', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Shapes', 'Silicon', 'Site', 'Social Justice', 'Social Obligations', 'Social Responsibility', 'South Africa', 'South African', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Training Programs', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'career development', 'comparative', 'curative treatments', 'design', 'drug development', 'ethical legal social implication', 'experience', 'gene therapy', 'genome editing', 'improved', 'individual response', 'innovation', 'insight', 'member', 'nebula', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutics', 'operation', 'population health', 'programs', 'research and development', 'social', 'theories', 'training project']",NHGRI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R00,2021,249000
"Computational and electrochemical substrates of social decision-making in humans SUMMARY Dopamine and serotonin systems in the human brain represent two key neuromodulatory signalling systems that impact mood, value-based decision-making, learning, and a host of other cognitive functions. Despite their importance, there is no consensus view from a psychological or computational perspective concerning their exact information-processing functions. Consequently, there is a scarceness of strategies to treat disorders that afflict these systems. We believe that this gap exists primarily because of methodological limitations. While there are many fast methods for recording action potential activity and local field potentials, similar progress for tracking `the other end of the problem' - neurochemical dynamics - has lagged far behind. This is unfortunate since just considering the catecholamines dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine, the worldwide health burden of dysfunction in these neuromodulatory systems is immense approaching 400 million people worldwide if one includes just Major Depression and Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorders (WHO, 2017). The overall goal of this project is to investigate the computational and neuromodulatory substrates of interactive social processes hypothesized to be trans-diagnostic RDoC constructs. We will utilize two levels of analysis (molecules/circuits and behavioral/computational) across two RDoC constructs (systems for social processes: perception and understanding of others, subconstruct understanding mental states, and positive valence systems: reward learning, subconstruct reward prediction error) to make inroads into understanding the computational and neural underpinnings of social interaction in humans. Crucially, the interactive social tasks used in this proposal generate an important class of learning signal – a reward prediction error signal – but expressed in the context of an inter-personal interaction. Our two levels of analysis employ (1) computational models of human (two-agent) social exchange estimated from detailed, observed behavior and (2) unique sub- second measurements of dopamine and serotonin from human striatum (three separate sites: caudate, putamen, ventral striatum) during the window-of-opportunity afforded by deep brain stimulating (DBS) electrode implantation surgery for Parkinson's Disease, Essential Tremors, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. PROJECT NARRATIVE (RELEVANCE) Dopamine and serotonin jointly influence a broad range of healthy cognition and changes in their delivery or action are thought to underpin a variety of pathological conditions including major depressive disorder, drug addiction, attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder, and Parkinson's Disease. During the window-of-opportunity afforded by deep brain stimulating (DBS) electrode implantation, we will make the first recordings of joint dopamine and serotonin dynamics in the striatum of conscious humans during the execution of inter-personal social exchange games. This work will address for the first time how these important neuromodulators encode social processes important for healthy cognition and affected by disease and injury.",Computational and electrochemical substrates of social decision-making in humans,10227238,R01MH124115,"['Action Potentials', 'Address', 'Affect', 'American Psychiatric Association', 'Antisocial Personality Disorder', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Catecholamines', 'Cognition', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Models', 'Conscious', 'Consensus', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Drug Addiction', 'Electrodes', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Essential Tremor', 'Failure', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Injury', 'Interpersonal Relations', 'Investments', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Neuromodulator', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Norepinephrine', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Play', 'Positive Valence', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Serotonergic System', 'Serotonin', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Perception', 'Social Processes', 'System', 'Time', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'arm', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'dopamine system', 'human model', 'implantation', 'information processing', 'mental state', 'neurochemistry', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'psychologic', 'putamen', 'relating to nervous system', 'social', 'social communication', 'social deficits', 'social norm', 'social relationships']",NIMH,VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INST AND ST UNIV,R01,2021,996439
"“Overlapping and Discrete Pathways Through Which Prenatal Isolation and Uncertainty Stress Impact Maternal Mental Health and Child Neurodevelopment PROJECT SUMMARY The prenatal period is regarded as one of the most sensitive phases in human development. Events that occur during gestation can alter the course of development with lasting impact. Presently, the COVID-19 pandemic is exerting wide-spread impact on the lives of expectant mothers around the world. Particularly salient pandemic- related stressors that are being experienced by pregnant women are social isolation and uncertainty stress. There is ample physiological and behavioral literature showing that social isolation and uncertainty stress affect typical human and animal psychobiological functioning, but there is an absence of knowledge about how these conditions might impact the physical and psychological health of a pregnant woman, and what the consequences of those changes might be for her developing child. The central objective of this proposal is to build foundational knowledge about the effects of prenatal social isolation and uncertainty stress on maternal psychobiology and infant neurobehavior. We will explore several candidate physiological systems in the mother to elucidate mechanisms that underlie associations between maternal stressors and child outcomes. To achieve these goals, we will recruit 200 women from a large New York City cohort established at the height of the pandemic into a prospective, longitudinal study that will include pre- and postnatal biospecimen collection and child neurobehavioral assessments at 6-, 12- and 24 months. Multi-modal neuroimaging strategies, including infant EEG and quantitative MRI, and innovative remote biophysical data collection strategies will be employed. The primary aims of this project are to (i) examine the impact of prenatal social isolation and uncertainty stress on maternal biology and postnatal mental health; (ii) evaluate the influence of maternal prenatal social isolation and uncertainty stress on infant neurobehavioral development; and (iii) examine the role of prenatal social isolation and uncertainty stress on mother-infant bi-directional interactions. We will thus be able to meaningfully evaluate whether, and how, prenatal social isolation and uncertainty stress modify maternal biology and affect, and the neurobehavioral consequences of those impacts on infants. Such work would constitute a substantial advance in our understanding of the longitudinal effects of prenatal psychosocial stress exposures, the underlying mechanistic pathways, and the origins of child neurobehavioral disorders. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Isolation, insecurity and uncertainty can impact the psychiatric health of pregnant mothers, with substantial lasting morbidity for mother and child. The goal of this project is to lay critical foundations for understanding the biological consequences of social isolation and uncertainty stress, and the roles they play in both maternal and child outcomes.",“Overlapping and Discrete Pathways Through Which Prenatal Isolation and Uncertainty Stress Impact Maternal Mental Health and Child Neurodevelopment,10231690,R01MH126468,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Allopregnanolone', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Bioenergetics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Collection', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Disasters', 'Economics', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Endocrine', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fiber', 'Foundations', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Height', 'Home environment', 'Hormonal', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Infant', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Leptin', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Modality', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mothers', 'Movement', 'Myelin', 'Neurocognitive', 'New York City', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Perinatal', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Postpartum Depression', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Prevalence', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychosocial Stress', 'Questionnaires', 'Relaxation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sinus Arrhythmia', 'Social Environment', 'Social isolation', 'Societies', 'Stress', 'Sum', 'Supervision', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'Work', 'arm', 'awake', 'base', 'care providers', 'cohort', 'course development', 'experience', 'family support', 'follow-up', 'imaging approach', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multimodality', 'neurobehavior', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurobehavioral disorder', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'new technology', 'offspring', 'pandemic disease', 'physical conditioning', 'postnatal', 'preclinical study', 'pregnant', 'prenatal', 'prospective', 'psychobiologic', 'psychobiology', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'remote sensing', 'respiratory', 'response', 'restraint', 'sensor technology', 'serial imaging', 'sound', 'stressor', 'tool']",NIMH,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,871099
"A Mobile Game for Domain Adaptation and Deep Learning in Autism Healthcare Project Summary Neuropsychiatric disorders are the single greatest cause of disability due to non-communicable disease worldwide, accounting for 14% of the global burden of disease. The current standards of care suffer from subjectivity, inconsistent delivery, and limited access with growing waitlists. New informatics solutions, in particular artificial intelligence (AI) that can port to more ubiquitous mobile health devices and that are not restricted for use in clinical settings, have great potential to complement or even replace aspects of the standards of care. We propose to develop a novel informatics solution for one of the most pressing mental health burdens, autism, which is up in incidence by more than 600% since 1990, among the fastest growing pediatric concerns today, and highly representative of many other neuropsychiatric conditions. We have invented a prototype mobile system called Guess What (guesswhat.stanford.edu) (GW) that turns the focus of the camera on the child through a fluid social engagement with his/her social partner that reinforces prosocial learning while simultaneously measuring the child’s developmental learning progress. At its simplest level, the GW app challenges the child to imitate social and emotion-centric prompts shown on the screen of a smartphone held just above the eyes of the individual with whom the child is playing. But more, as a home-based repeat-use system, GW uses computer vision algorithms and emotion classifiers integrated into gameplay to detect emotion in the child’s face via the phone’s front camera, automatically finding agreement with the displayed prompt, while capturing features such as gaze, eye contact, and joint attention. Preliminary work with more than 20 autistic children resulted in positive user feedback, evidence of high engagement for both the parents and children, and importantly, evidence of clinically meaningful gains in socialization. A single session produces 90 seconds of enriched social video and sensor data, opening up an exciting opportunity for the game play itself to passively generate labeled computer vision libraries that enable the development of better models with higher diagnostic precision going forward. Our proposed project will show that GW can (a.) serve as a mobile therapy that can be used repeatedly by families to target core deficits of autism while inherently tracking progress during use, and, (b.) serve as a distributed system to crowdsource the acquisition of new labeled image libraries for AI models that can automatically classify diagnostic features relevant to autism and extend to other sectors of mental health (and even beyond). Project Narrative Mental health, which accounts for a significant percentage of the global health burden, can be effectively managed through mobile and digital tools, yet suffers from limited access, inconsistent treatments, and qualitative approaches that do not scale. Taking aim at an increasingly pervasive and canonical mental health problem, autism, we plan to build a game-based solution that can treat (addressing issues social interaction, eye contact, and social-emotional awareness, among other things) while tracking progress, and that can automatically generate computer vision libraries for deep learning models that permit enhanced diagnostic feature extraction in the future.",A Mobile Game for Domain Adaptation and Deep Learning in Autism Healthcare,10122795,R01LM013364,"['8 year old', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Android', 'Anger', 'Animals', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Distributed Systems', 'Dose', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Enrollment', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Forehead', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gestures', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Label', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Interaction', 'Socialization', 'Speed', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Waiting Lists', 'Work', 'applied behavior analysis', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'computer generated', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'crowdsourcing', 'data archive', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'digital', 'disability', 'feasibility testing', 'feature extraction', 'gaze', 'global health', 'image archival system', 'innovation', 'interest', 'joint attention', 'mHealth', 'neural network', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'personalized care', 'personalized diagnostics', 'personalized health care', 'prototype', 'repository', 'sensor', 'social', 'social communication', 'social engagement', 'social reciprocity', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,667434
"Mining Social Media Big Data for Toxicovigilance: Automating the Monitoring of Prescription Medication Abuse via Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning Methods Project Summary The problem of prescription medication (PM) abuse has reached epidemic proportions in the United States. According to a 2014 report by the Director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), an estimated 52 million people, have been involved in the non-medical use of PMs— a significant portion of which can be classified as abuse. PMs that are commonly abused include opioids, central nervous system depressants and stimulants, and the consequences of their abuse may be severe. Increases in PM misuse and abuse over the last 15 years have resulted in increased emergency department visits, rates of addiction and overdose deaths. Due to the rapidly escalating morbidity and mortality, it is now receiving national attention. The opioid crisis, which has its root in opioid-based PM abuse, has been declared a national emergency by the president of the United States. Despite the problems associated with PM abuse, surveillance programs such as prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs) are inadequate and suffer from numerous shortcomings, thus limiting their usefulness in real life. Studies evaluating the long-term effects of distinct classes of PMs on cohorts of abusers are scarce and expensive to conduct. To better characterize the problem and to monitor it in real-time, new sources of information need to be identified and novel monitoring techniques need to be developed. To address these problems, our project aims to utilize social media data for performing toxicovigilance. Social media encapsulates an abundance of knowledge about PM abuse and the abusers in the form of noisy natural language text. At the heart of the proposed approach is a machine learning system that can automatically distinguish between `abuse' and `non-abuse' indicating user posts collected from social media. Using this classification system, users will be categorized into multiple groups—(i) abusers, (ii) medical users and (iii) non users. The developed system will collect longitudinal data for users exposed the selected PMs via periodic collection of their publicly available posts/discussions and automatically categorize them based on age, gender and additional demographic feature, when possible. This will enable the conducting of observational studies on targeted cohorts, involving hundreds of thousands of cohort members. The cohort studies will focus on analyzing the transition rates from medical use to abuse for distinct PMs and transition rates from abuse of PMs to illicit analogs. Implementation of this data-centric framework, which will be open source, will revolutionize the mechanism by which PM abuse monitoring is performed and enable the future development of intervention strategies targeted towards specific cohorts, at the most effective time periods. Narrative Prescription Medication (PM) abuse is a major epidemic in the United States, and monitoring and studying the characteristics of the PM abuse problem requires the development of novel approaches. Social media encapsulates an abundance of data about PM abuse from different demographics, but extracting that data and converting it to knowledge requires advanced natural language processing and data-centric artificial intelligence systems. Our proposed social media mining framework will automate the process of big data to knowledge conversion for PM abuse, providing crucial insights to toxicologists about targeted populations and enabling the future development of directed intervention strategies.",Mining Social Media Big Data for Toxicovigilance: Automating the Monitoring of Prescription Medication Abuse via Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning Methods,10167665,R01DA046619,"['Adderall', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Automation', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Benzodiazepines', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Categories', 'Central Nervous System Depressants', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Drug abuse', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency department visit', 'Encapsulated', 'Epidemic', 'Event', 'Expert Systems', 'Exposure to', 'Fentanyl', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Heart', 'Heroin', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Ingestion', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Job loss', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Names', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Natural History', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Observational Study', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Overdose', 'Oxycodone', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Percocet', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Population Characteristics', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Schools', 'Social Impacts', 'Source', 'Supervision', 'Surveillance Program', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'Twitter', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Vicodin', 'Work', 'addiction', 'adverse outcome', 'age group', 'analog', 'base', 'cohort', 'deep neural network', 'demographics', 'design', 'drug misuse', 'experimental group', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'intervention program', 'large datasets', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'misuse of prescription only drugs', 'mortality', 'natural language', 'nonmedical use', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'opioid epidemic', 'overdose death', 'prescription drug abuse', 'prescription monitoring program', 'quetiapine', 'social media', 'social observations', 'spelling', 'study characteristics', 'supervised learning', 'therapy development']",NIDA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,332121
"A computer vision toolbox for computational analysis of nonverbal social communication PROJECT SUMMARY We will develop novel computer vision tools to reliably and precisely measure nonverbal social communication through quantifying communicative facial and bodily expressions. Our tools will be designed and developed in order to maximize their usability by non-engineer behavioral scientists, filling the enormous gap between engineering advances and their clinical accessibility. Significance: Social interaction inherently relies on perception and production of coordinated face and body expressions. Indeed, atypical face and body movements are observed in many disorders, impacting social interaction and communication. Traditional systems for quantifying nonverbal communication (e.g., FACS, BAP) require extensive training and coding time. Their tedious coding requirements drastically limits their scalability and reproducibility. While an extensive literature exists on advanced computer vision and machine learning techniques for face and body analysis, there is no well-established method commonly used in mental health community to quantify production of facial and bodily expressions or efficiently capture individual differences in nonverbal communication in general. As a part of this proposal, we will develop a computer vision toolbox including tools that are both highly granular and highly scalable, to allow for measurement of complex social behavior in large and heterogeneous populations. Approach: Our team will develop tools that provide granular metrics of nonverbal social behavior, including localized face and body kinematics, characteristics of elicited expressions, and imitation performance. Our tools will facilitate measurement of social communication both within a person and between people, to allow for assessment of individual social communication cues as well as those that occur within bidirectional social contexts. Preliminary Data: We have developed and applied novel computer vision tools to assess: (1) diversity of mouth motion during conversational speech (effect size d=1.0 in differentiating young adults with and without autism during a brief natural conversation), (2) interpersonal facial coordination (91% accuracy in classifying autism diagnosis in young adults during a brief natural conversation, replicated in an independent child sample), and (3) body action imitation (85% accuracy in classifying autism diagnosis based on body imitation performance). As apart of current proposal, we will develop more generic methods that can be used in normative and clinical samples. Aims. In Aim 1, we will develop tools to automatically quantify fine-grained face movements and their coordination during facial expression production; in Aim 2, we will develop tools to quantify body joint kinematics and their coordination during bodily expression production; in Aim 3, we will demonstrate the tools’ ability to yield dimensional metrics using machine learning. Impact: Our approach is designed for fast and rigorous assessment of nonverbal social communication, providing a scalable solution to measure individual variability, within a dimensional and transdiagnostic framework. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project develops novel tools for measuring nonverbal social communication as manifested through facial and bodily expressions. Using advanced computer vision and machine learning methodologies, we will quantify humans’ communicative social behavior. The results of this project will impact public health by facilitating a rich characterization of normative development of social functioning, providing access to precise phenotypic information for neuroscience and genetics studies, and by measuring subtle individual differences to determine whether some interventions or treatments work better than others.",A computer vision toolbox for computational analysis of nonverbal social communication,10150095,R01MH122599,"['Adolescent', 'Age', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Community Health', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Educational Materials', 'Engineering', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grain', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Nonverbal Communication', 'Oral cavity', 'Participant', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Sex Differences', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Development', 'Social Environment', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Interaction', 'Speech', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Teenagers', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavioral health', 'clinical application', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'individual variation', 'interest', 'kinematics', 'novel', 'open source', 'sex', 'social', 'social communication', 'tool', 'usability', 'young adult']",NIMH,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,R01,2021,660945
"Improving Telerehabilitation in Pediatric Cerebral Palsy Using Machine Learning and Social Robots PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common motor disorder in young children. There is no cure, but disciplined rehabilitation can improve outcomes. A critical component of rehabilitation is continuous assessment of patient function. Patients in rural areas can have difﬁculty accessing care. Telerehabilitation provides an option to extend access to care, but has limitations. The foci of this project are 1) understanding how a social robot physically co-located with the patient during a telerehabilitation assessment alters the activity by the patient, potentially leading to changes in the ability of the clinician to perform assessment and 2) whether computer vision and machine learning can be used to assess patients. Together, these two complementary goals will show a path forward for remote treatment of patients with CP and similar conditions.  The effect of using a social robot in telerehabilitation will be examined through a study where pediatric CP subjects and typical subjects interact with a remote operator in three conditions: face-to-face, over traditional telepresence, and over telepresence with a social robot present. Direct changes in the level of subject interaction and compliance will be measured through surveys and video coding. The effect on quality of assessment will be measured by presenting expert therapists with ﬁrst-person video recordings from each condition and comparing the variance of their grading for each condition.  To truly realize the promise of using remote assessment to extend care, automated grading of assessments is necessary. To evaluate the feasibility of this, videos of children with various levels of upper extremity function along with their box and block scores and clinician ratings will be used to train two algorithms. Both algorithms will begin by using off the shelf convolutional neural network based tools to extract the pose of the subjects. The ﬁrst algorithm will be hand designed. It will learn how to weight known metrics of motion, such as movement speed, time to maximum speed, and number of speed peaks, using principal component analysis and a naive Gaussian classiﬁer. The second algorithm will use a custom neural network operating directly on the time-series pose data. Both algorithms will attempt to, given video of a novel subject, predict the level of function as would be predicted by a therapist. Both algorithms will be analyzed to discover their underlying decision-making philosophies, which may give insight into what parameters of motion clearly differentiate levels of function.  The project will be done in the context of a pre-doctoral training plan. The plan focuses on developing an independent researcher at the intersection of robotics and rehabilitation science. This will be done within Mechanical Engineering, Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, and the General Robotics, Automation, Sensing, and Perception (GRASP) laboratory at the University of Pennsylvania with additional mentorship and experience at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. PROJECT NARRATIVE Limits to care for pediatric cerebral palsy patients in rural areas could be addressed through telepresence, but current technologies fail to adequately convey information. This project will explore whether combining social robots with telepresence systems and computer vision can improve the quality of telerehabilitation for the purpose of remote assessment. The social robot will aid communication to the patient, motivating them through activities, while the computer vision automatically assesses function.",Improving Telerehabilitation in Pediatric Cerebral Palsy Using Machine Learning and Social Robots,10285983,F31HD102165,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automatic Data Processing', 'Automation', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Discipline', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational Background', 'Engineering', 'Exercise', 'Facial Expression', 'Frequencies', 'Gaussian model', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Improve Access', 'Infant', 'Instruction', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Long-Term Care', 'Long-Term Care for Elderly', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Network-based', 'Occupational Therapy', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pennsylvania', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Philadelphia', 'Philosophy', 'Physical Medicine', 'Physical Rehabilitation', 'Physical therapy', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Series', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Systems Integration', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Travel', 'Universities', 'Upper Extremity', 'Video Recording', 'Weight', 'Work', 'arm', 'arm movement', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'communication aid', 'convolutional neural network', 'design', 'experience', 'human-robot interaction', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'kinematics', 'motor disorder', 'neural network', 'novel', 'pediatric patients', 'peer', 'pre-doctoral', 'prototype', 'rehabilitation science', 'robot rehabilitation', 'robotic system', 'rural area', 'social assistive robot', 'telepresence', 'telerehabilitation', 'tool', 'vocalization']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F31,2021,46036
"Identifying False HPV-Vaccine Information and Modeling Its Impact on Risk Perceptions PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the United States, with over 30,000 new HPV-related-cancers are diagnosed annually. Although HPV vaccines have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) since 2006 and recommended for routine vaccination for school-age girls and boys, vaccination rates remain low. One reason that has contributed to low vaccination rates is incorrect “risk perceptions” around HPV vaccines such as the high perceived risks of adverse events or side effects from the HPV vaccine. Incorrect risk perceptions are often rooted in the false information about HPV vaccines that people are exposed to in their daily life, including social media. The impact of social media on health information is substantial. Negative social-media HPV-vaccine information has been found to have an association with low vaccination coverage. Given the negative consequences of false information, there is a need to develop a robust and scalable way to detect false HPV-vaccine information before it propagates and negatively impacts behavior. The overarching goal of the proposed research is to build a model to identify false HPV-vaccine information on Twitter, demonstrate its impact on individual risk perceptions and measure its underlying mechanisms on risk perception formation. We propose a novel approach to leverage machine learning, natural language processing, network analysis, crowdsourcing/expert data annotation, psycholinguistic analysis and statistical modeling to investigate the false HPV-vaccine information collectively (in terms of its detection and propagation patterns) and individually (in terms of its impact and underlying cognitive mechanisms). Our study will first build a computational model to detect false HPV-vaccine information on Twitter. By modeling the domain-specific HPV- vaccine related text content, information-veracity related linguistic features, individual and collective user behaviors, and dissemination patterns, our model will be able to detect false HPV-vaccine information before it gets verified and spreads widely. We will then investigate the impact of false HPV-vaccine information on risk perceptions around HPV vaccination operationalized by natural language processing methods and a developed HPV-vaccine Risk Lexicon. We will further conduct psycholinguistic analysis on the false HPV-vaccine information and use statistical modeling to uncover the underlying mechanism of risk perceptions. Our study will make a critical and timely contribution to identifying the false HPV-vaccine information and its impact, which has the potential to be applied to other health topics. This proposed project will also address the National Cancer Institute priorities in promoting HPV vaccines and combating misinformation in cancer prevention and control. PROJECT NARRATIVE The uptake of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine remains low in part because of incorrect perceptions of vaccination risks, which has been linked to the spread of false HPV-vaccine information. The proposed study seeks to build a computational model to detect false HPV-vaccine information on social media (Twitter) and determine its impact on risk perceptions of the HPV vaccine. The findings will provide important contributions to understand the impact of false health information on HPV vaccination behavior and could be expanded to other health topics.",Identifying False HPV-Vaccine Information and Modeling Its Impact on Risk Perceptions,10114245,R21CA237483,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anxiety', 'Attitude', 'Behavior', 'Cancer Control', 'Categories', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Electronic cigarette', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Fright', 'Goals', 'Harm Reduction', 'Health', 'Human Papilloma Virus Vaccination', 'Human Papilloma Virus Vaccine', 'Human Papilloma Virus-Related Malignant Neoplasm', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Human papilloma virus infection', 'Individual', 'Information Dissemination', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Misinformation', 'Modeling', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Participant', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Plant Roots', 'Politics', 'Property', 'Psycholinguistics', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'School-Age Population', 'Semantics', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Text', 'Time', 'Twitter', 'United States', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Work', 'adverse event risk', 'boys', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer prevention', 'crowdsourcing', 'deep learning', 'girls', 'high risk', 'information model', 'information processing', 'multilevel analysis', 'news', 'novel strategies', 'premalignant', 'prevent', 'recurrent neural network', 'response', 'risk perception', 'side effect', 'social media', 'theories', 'uptake', 'vaccine acceptance']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R21,2021,174255
"Leveraging Social Media Data and Machine Learning to Optimize Treatment Paradigms for Youth with Schizophrenia Abstract Schizophrenia constitutes a chronic and disabling illness. While patients show high rates of response to treatment after a ﬁrst-episode of schizophrenia, the long-term course of the illness is typically characterized by frequent re- lapses, persistence of symptoms, and enduring cognitive and functional deﬁcits. Despite the prioritization of relapse prevention as a treatment goal, about four out of ﬁve patients experience a relapse within the ﬁrst ﬁve years of treatment. Relapses are known to have serious psychosocial, educational, or vocational implications in young adults—a population at high risk of psychosis. However, current psychiatric ability to recognize indicators of relapse in order to prevent escalation of psychotic symptoms is markedly limited. Challenges stem from a lack of availability of comprehensive information about early warning signs, and reliance on ﬁxed time point sampling of cross-sectional data as well as patient or family reported observations, that is subject to recall bias, or on clin- ician sought information, that needs frequent and timely contact. The present proposal seeks to address these gaps in early psychosis treatment, by leveraging patient-generated and patient-volunteered social media data, and developing and validating machine learning approaches for “digital phenotyping” and relapse prediction. Our proposed work is founded on the observation that social media sites have emerged as prominent platforms of emotional and linguistic expression—young adults are among the heaviest users of social media. The work signif- icantly advances the research agenda and extensive pilot investigations of the team, who a) have demonstrated that social media data of individuals can serve as a powerful “lens” toward understanding and inferring mental health state, illness course, and likelihood of relapse, including among young adults with early psychosis; and b) have been involved in examining the role of emergent technologies, like social media, in improving access to and delivery of psychiatric care. Aim 1 will provide theoretically-grounded and clinically meaningful methods for extracting and modeling digital phenotypes and symptoms from social media data of young adult early psychosis patients. Then in Aim 2, we will develop and evaluate machine learning methods that will utilize the extracted social media digital phenotypes to infer patient-speciﬁc personalized risk of relapse, and identify its antecedents. Finally, Aim 3 will develop a two-faceted validation framework, to assess the statistical and clinical efﬁcacy and utility of the social media derived inferences of psychosis and relapse in inﬂuencing clinical outcomes and in facilitating evidence-based treatment. To accomplish these aims, the project brings together a strong multidisci- plinary team, combining expertise in social media analytics, psychiatry, psychology, natural language analysis, machine learning, information privacy, and research ethics. Our novel approach offers unprecedented opportuni- ties to initiate the adoption of personalized, responsive, and preemptive evidence-based strategies in treatment of psychosis. The knowledge will set the stage for future research on launching large-scale trials aimed to develop interventions that diminish the severity of relapses, or prevent their occurrence altogether. Project Narrative Timely monitoring of symptoms and preventing relapse after an initial psychotic episode are essential component of early intervention programs and have a critical impact on long term outcome in individuals with psychotic dis- orders. Employing patient-contributed social media data as a viable source of collateral information, this proposal provides a suite of robust, scalable, and ﬁeld evaluated machine learning methods to facilitate early and precise identiﬁcation of digital phenotypes, symptomatic exacerbation, and risk of psychotic relapse in early psychosis patients. The knowledge would provide the necessary opportunity to initiate personalized, adaptive, and proac- tive illness management strategies, inform better nosology, and assist the adoption of improved evidence-based care approaches to diminish the severity of relapses, or prevent their occurrence altogether.",Leveraging Social Media Data and Machine Learning to Optimize Treatment Paradigms for Youth with Schizophrenia,10119327,R01MH117172,"['Address', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computational Technique', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Disorientation', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hospitalization', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Privacy', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Ethics', 'Research Methodology', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Psychology', 'Source', 'Stigmatization', 'Strategic Planning', 'Suicide', 'Surface', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Violence', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'biological research', 'biomarker development', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'cohort', 'computational basis', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'digital media', 'digital models', 'disability', 'disease classification', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'family burden', 'first episode schizophrenia', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovative technologies', 'intervention program', 'lens', 'machine learning method', 'medical complication', 'multidisciplinary', 'natural language', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'peer', 'personalized intervention', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychosocial', 'psychotic symptoms', 'recruit', 'relapse patients', 'relapse prediction', 'relapse risk', 'response', 'social', 'social media', 'social observations', 'stem', 'support tools', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'volunteer', 'willingness', 'young adult']",NIMH,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2021,641065
"Using Machine Learning to Detect and Characterize Synthetic Psychoactive Drug Digital Marketing and Distribution The study will address a critical challenge regarding the public health threat of synthetic psychoactive drugs (SPDs): identifying and characterizing how social media is used to market, distribute and sell these products to the public. We will carry out these aims by examining large volumes of data from popular social media platforms Twitter and Instagram using an innovative methodology involving machine learning and multidisciplinary data analysis. This research project addresses a key NIDA research objective: “research on factors which influence initiation, continuation and desistance of use of specific SPDs in different populations. Examples include:…market and distribution factors; policies; and the role of peer influences, social media and the internet.” We will first collect large volumes of data filtered for SPD drug diversion, marketing, and drug dealing via social media posts, comments, and other messages. We will then code the data using an advanced machine learning protocol. Finally, we will analyze the data using statistical, geospatial and network analysis to assess associations between SPD marketing and specific risk factors for user groups. We will accomplish these objectives using a multidisciplinary approach that involves disciplines and methods from public health-epidemiology, substance abuse research, computation science, legal and policy analysis, and geospatial analysis. The project has the following specific aims:  Aim 1: Conduct digital surveillance of popular social media platforms Twitter and Instagram in order to  describe the nature and magnitude of online marketing, sale and distribution of SPDs;  Aim 2: Characterize the types of marketing strategies used by SPD vendors and drug dealers on these  platforms, including marketing messages used to influence knowledge, attitudes and perceptions  pertaining to SPDs and identification of the users and networks they target;  Aim 3: Using statistical, network and geospatial methods, describe, test, and visualize associations  between SPD marketing and distribution and specific risk factors and user groups. This is a critical opportunity to better understand how social media contributes to a growing “digital” risk environment that can influence user initiation and enable illegal access to SPDs. Though research examining the linkages between social media and substance abuse has been growing, no study has specifically examined online marketing and access characteristics on more than one platform while at the same time assessing how geographic and user network factors can impact this unique and largely unregulated risk environment. Results from this study can generate further study hypotheses on the association between SPD behavioral risk factors and SPD product trends, while also informing future interventions utilizing e-health tools including targeted regulation, health education, and counter-marketing. The emergence of the public health threat of synthetic cannabinoids and other new synthetic psychoactive substances (SPDs) is coinciding with an increase in the use of the Internet and social media to promote substance abuse behavior and illicit access. In response, the proposed project will leverage advanced methods in “big data” analysis to identify and characterize marketing and distribution of SPDs by conducting surveillance of SPD content and messages on Twitter and Instagram.

"Multimodal, integrated analysis of neural activity and naturalistic social behavior in freely moving mice Project Summary/Abstract  This proposal responds to an NIMH notice NOT-MH-18-036 aimed at the development and study of novel, computationally defined behavioral assays, and at applying theory and mathematical modeling to better capture the richness of complex, naturalistic behaviors. Specifically, we aim to develop novel computational tools for analyzing social behaviors in freely moving mice, and relating those identified behaviors to neural circuit activity in brain regions that govern the expression of those behaviors. Social behavior is affected in many human psychiatric disorders, such as autism, schizophrenia, and depression. We propose an interdisciplinary, collaborative approach to fill two major gaps that present a barrier to studies of social behavior: 1) the lack of quantitative and high-resolution descriptions of naturalistic social behaviors in freely moving animals, and 2) the difficulty of relating neural activity recorded in deep subcortical regions that govern such behaviors, such as the hypothalamus and extended amygdala, to animals' actions or to models of behavioral control. Our objective is to create a computational behavior analysis platform that integrates automated measurement of naturalistic social behavior, synchronous large-scale recording or imaging of neural activity, and apply these to a novel assay to investigate social behavioral decision-making. The central objective of this proposal is to extend our Mouse Action Recognition System (MARS) to create a platform that allows facile training of supervised and unsupervised behavior classifiers, quantitative correlation with simultaneously acquired neural recording or imaging data, and which can be flexibly adapted to additional behavior assays. The rationale for this approach is that fine-grained quantification of social behavior, and its correlation with neural recordings, is necessary to form and test theories of behavioral control by subcortical brain regions. While automated tracking and “pose” estimation software such as DeepLabCut have made tracking of animals' body positions more feasible, the identification of social behaviors from pose data is a non-trivial problem, requiring a separate computational approach that takes into account the relative movements of multiple animals over time. To achieve our objective, we will broaden the palette of social behaviors MARS can detect using machine learning and generative models (Aim 1), develop methods to relate those behaviors to neural activity (Aim 2), and extend MARS to additional assays to study neural correlates of social decision-making. This contribution is significant because it will create a resource that will transform our ability to study micro- and meso-scale subcortical circuits controlling social behavior. The contribution is innovative because it combines expertise from circuit neuroscience and computer vision/machine learning to create new tools for understanding the link between neural activity and behavior, in a context that is relevant to understanding dysfunctions of neural circuits that underlie human psychiatric disorders. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because it develops new methods to investigate the neural circuits governing naturalistic social behaviors in animal models, and such behaviors are often disrupted in human psychiatric disorders such as autism, schizophrenia, and depression. Our objective is to use computer vision and machine learning algorithms (AI) to produce detailed and reproducible measurements capturing the richness of social behaviors, and to correlate those behaviors with simultaneously recorded neural activity in freely interacting animals. We apply these techniques in established and novel social behavior assays to test hypotheses about the neural mechanisms underlying social behavioral decision-making.","Multimodal, integrated analysis of neural activity and naturalistic social behavior in freely moving mice",10226273,R01MH123612,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Behavioral Model', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Control Animal', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Image', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neuronal Dysfunction', 'Neurosciences', 'Performance', 'Population Dynamics', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Public Health', 'Reciprocal Social Interaction', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Identification', 'Social Interaction', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triad Acrylic Resin', 'Variant', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'body position', 'collaborative approach', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neural correlate', 'neuromechanism', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'social', 'social defeat', 'social structure', 'temporal measurement', 'theories', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIMH,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2021,416250
"Optimized Affective Computing Measures of Social Processes and Negative Valence in Youth Psychopathology ABSTRACT Difficulties with emotion expression and social behavior characterize multiple psychiatric conditions and negatively impact child development. However, existing measurement tools for indexing social-emotional function are imprecise and subjective, or require specialized training that is costly and time-intensive, prohibiting widespread implementation. The imprecision of existing tools has a major negative impact not only on research, but on the ability to assess and treat individuals with mental health concerns – especially among underserved and under-resourced populations. Here, we propose to address this problem by quantifying social and emotional behavior using novel biobehavioral markers derived from computer vision (facial expression analysis) and computational linguistics (social/sentiment analysis). Our team has successfully used these markers to predict the presence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) with 91% accuracy. In this proposal, we determine the extent to which our markers can serve as continuous measures of social behavior and negative emotion to advance clinical phenotyping and interventions. The proposal brings together two high-bandwidth clinical research programs at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and Baylor College of Medicine to collect data on 750 adolescents (ages 12-17 inclusive) with ASD, a primary anxiety or depressive disorder, or without any developmental/psychiatric condition. At a single assessment, all youth will participate in an extensive clinical phenotyping battery consisting of validated clinical interviews and child-/parent-report scales assessing converging and diverging mental health constructs, and three tasks eliciting positive/negative emotion, social stress, and mild frustration. A subsample of 150 adolescents will be reassessed 6-10 weeks later to allow retest/stability analyses. A novel camera apparatus will capture naturalistic synchronized verbal and nonverbal signals from dyads. Our analytic approach combines state-of-the-art machine learning, computational linguistics, and computer vision – including facial emotion recognition methods that rival several commonly used alternatives. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to develop valid and objective measures of the Social and Negative Valence Systems using novel biobehavioral markers in a large transdiagnostic sample of youth. Secondary goals are to develop easy-to-follow methods to widely disseminate our tools and procedures, and to characterize individual variability in these key RDoC metrics by age, gender, race/ethnicity, and diagnosis. The achievement of these goals will provide researchers with sorely needed measures of social and emotional behavior, and provide clinicians with a new set of tools for identifying and tracking youth in need of mental health treatment. PROJECT NARRATIVE Problems with negative emotion and social behavior are present across many behavioral health conditions, but are poorly measured with existing tools. This application addresses this problem by developing and validating novel facial expression and linguistic measures that can be easily and widely disseminated across research and clinical settings.",Optimized Affective Computing Measures of Social Processes and Negative Valence in Youth Psychopathology,10183399,R01MH125958,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Depressive disorder', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Factor Analysis', 'Frustration', 'Funding', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investments', 'Judgment', 'Laboratories', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Negative Valence', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Phenotype', 'Philadelphia', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Procedures', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychopathology', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Smiling', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Processes', 'Specialist', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Trier Social Stress Test', 'Variant', 'Youth', 'affective computing', 'aged', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavioral health', 'biobehavior', 'clinical phenotype', 'college', 'cost', 'digital', 'emotional behavior', 'emotional functioning', 'experimental study', 'indexing', 'individual variation', 'natural language', 'novel', 'programs', 'repetitive behavior', 'response', 'showing emotion', 'social', 'social anxiety', 'social deficits', 'social metrics', 'social stress', 'tool']",NIMH,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,R01,2021,861615
"ARGUS-MDS: automated, quantitative and scalable system for social processes in behavioral health Argus Cognitive STTR Grant Application Abstract Standardized behavioral observation methods are integral to developmental, educational, and behavioral science research. However, existing observational strategies are too laborious to use in large-scale, intervention and dissemination trials needed in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In addition, current observational strategies do not yield sufficiently quantitative, comparable and granular assessment that could drive the comparison of therapies in clinical trials or the optimization and personalization of intervention. We are developing a minimally intrusive medical device technology (“ARGUS-MDS”) to simultaneously monitor multiple key social and problem behaviors in individuals with ASD and related neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Our team represents an essential collaboration between computer and clinical scientists with expertise in artificial intelligence (AI), NDDs, diagnostics, multi-modal interventions, and psychometrics. We seek support in the form of a Fast Track STTR grant to validate the psychometric properties of ARGUS-MDS and its ability to provide data on change in target behaviors in early childhood and school-aged children. This would then support the development of a scalable, digital treatment progress indicator for behaviors reflecting social, repetitive behavior, and associated symptom profiles in ASD. In Phase I, video and audio data will be collected during gold-standard diagnostic evaluations individuals with ASD (n=15). Aim 1.1 will establish quality and clinical validity of ARGUS-MDS algorithms for key social communication behaviors, while Aim 1.2 will evaluate test-retest reliability of biometric output. Phase I will show that ARGUS-MDS meets quality metrics for biometric output, validates the clinician- technician feedback system, and establishes intraclass correlation coefficients for automated social communication (AutoSC) output. In Phase II our focus shifts to establishing psychometric properties of derived scores for AutoSC analysis, evaluating convergence with established clinical and functional measures, and preparing for regulatory filing in Phase III. Aim 2.1. will develop scores from biometric data through exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses of social communication behaviors. Aim 2.2 evaluates correspondence of AutoSC scores to scores on standardized clinical assessments. Aim 2.3 develops a comprehensive Validation Strategy and executes Analytical Validation, per medical device design control regulation and FDA guidance. Phase II will develop scores from AutoSC output, evaluate measurement characteristics of AutoSC scores, reliability & validity of Autos SC scores, and executes all Analytical Validations per the strategy document and FDA guidance. Phase I and II milestones will set us up for commercialization in Phase III, including filing for regulatory approval and product launch. Successful completion of this project will provide a novel, scalable medical device technology to support objective, automated clinical evaluations of social impairments in ASD and other NDDs. Argus Cognitive STTR Grant Application NARRATIVE We seek to contribute to the digital health movement through validation of a minimally intrusive monitoring system (“ARGUS-MDS”) to simultaneously track multiple key social and problem behaviors in individuals with ASD and related neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) including Fragile X Syndrome (FXS). This new technology will make diagnosis and monitoring of these disorders quantitative, scalable, and affordable, removing a serious bottleneck in the current patient journey, related to 1) the limited availability of highly trained human experts and 2) the qualitative and subjective nature of the results attained with current observational strategies. Using advanced video and audio analytics and machine learning, ARGUS-MDS achieves an automated, quantitative, and comprehensive assessment of each patient, across settings (clinical trials, academic research, specialty clinics, pediatric offices and homes), without requiring the presence of a human expert during the monitored diagnostic, monitoring or therapy sessions.","ARGUS-MDS: automated, quantitative and scalable system for social processes in behavioral health",10019734,R44MH121965,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automation', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Biometry', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based practice', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Factor Analysis', 'Feedback', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention Trial', 'Language', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Device', 'Medical Device Designs', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Nonverbal Communication', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Problem behavior', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychometrics', 'Public Health', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'School-Age Population', 'Scientist', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Processes', 'Speech', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Validity and Reliability', 'analog', 'associated symptom', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'behavior observation', 'behavioral health', 'clinical practice', 'commercialization', 'communication behavior', 'digital health', 'digital treatment', 'disability', 'dissemination trial', 'early childhood', 'experimental study', 'functional disability', 'functional outcomes', 'gaze', 'improved', 'individuals with autism spectrum disorder', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medical specialties', 'motor control', 'multi-component intervention', 'neuropsychiatry', 'new technology', 'novel', 'personalized intervention', 'programs', 'repetitive behavior', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'showing emotion', 'social', 'social communication', 'social deficits', 'social reciprocity']",NIMH,"ARGUS COGNITIVE, INC.",R44,2021,485065
"Passive mobile sensing and machine learning for the detection of drinking episodes PROJECT SUMMARY  Ambulatory assessment (AA) techniques (e.g., ecological momentary assessment, daily diaries, experiencing sampling) have provided critical tests of theories about the development of alcohol use disorder (AUD) by identifying within-person processes (such as negative or reinforcement, stress exposure, or social context) that can raise the risk for problem drinking and in turn AUD. AA methods are the leading methodological approach in the push towards personalized medicine because it provides a compelling platform for assessment, diagnosis, real-time monitoring, and just-in-time interventions. However, the current utility of AA for personalized models of AUD risk is limited because risky drinking and the risk factors for it (such as changes in moods, stress, or social contexts) change at different scales of time. In other words, even heavy drinkers may only drink a few times a week, but their emotions, stressors and social contexts change multiple times a day. Current AA methods that rely on self-report data have to sample frequently enough to be sensitive to change, long enough to observe sufficient drinking episodes, and to do so while avoiding participant burnout. Passive mobile sensing, which uses sensors (such as GPS, accelerometer, light meter, etc.) available on most smartphones, has been shown in preliminary studies to predict the probability of drinking episodes, but those studies have used relatively small samples. The present career development award aims to develop the candidate’s expertise in passive mobile sensing and the machine learning methods used to analyze passive mobile sensing data. The research proposal will analyze passive mobile sensing data collected in a large sample of regular drinking and marijuana using young adults (age 18 – 22, n = 500; 95.2% who drink), who will be followed using AA over 8 successive weekends as part of a parent R01 (DA 047247). The research goal is to identify passive mobile sensing models of risk factors for drinking (stress, social contexts, sleep, mood, and impulsive states), as well as the drinking episodes themselves. The candidate will develop expertise in these methods and models that will further the development of a research program aimed at developing person specific models of risk for AUD. PROJECT NARRATIVE The career development plan will develop expertise of the investigator in the collection and analysis of passive mobile sensing data, with an emphasis on the application of machine learning methods. The proposed research study will use passive mobile sensing data in a large ambulatory assessment sample of regular drinkers, to develop models linking passive mobile sensing data with predictors of drinking episodes (such as stress, social context, and impulsiveness) and the drinking episodes themselves.",Passive mobile sensing and machine learning for the detection of drinking episodes,10102612,K02AA028832,"['Accelerometer', 'Age', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcoholic beverage heavy drinker', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Car Phone', 'Cellular Phone', 'Collection', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Security', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Emotions', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Impulsivity', 'Independent Scientist Award', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Light', 'Link', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sleep', 'Social Environment', 'Stress', 'Techniques', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'Time', 'Training', 'alcohol risk', 'alcohol use disorder', 'analytical method', 'burnout', 'career development', 'data streams', 'design', 'diaries', 'disorder risk', 'drinking', 'drinking behavior', 'experience', 'feature selection', 'handheld mobile device', 'high risk drinking', 'machine learning method', 'marijuana use', 'marijuana user', 'meter', 'open source', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized intervention', 'personalized medicine', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'real time monitoring', 'research study', 'sensor', 'stressor', 'temporal measurement', 'theories', 'young adult']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K02,2021,142338

The proposal is based on the premise that identifying specific behavioral and neural network targets can guide development of streamlined interventions with potential for broad scalability and reach. “Engage”, a streamlined therapy for late-life depression, whose principal intervention is “reward exposure”, may change Positive Valence Systems (PVS) functions. Preliminary studies by the candidate show that early increase in resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) of PVS structures during “Engage” predicts increased behavioral activation. Additionally, compared to solitary pleasant activities, exposure to rewarding social interactions during “Engage” leads to greater increase in behavioral activation and reduction of depression severity. Finally, a machine learning analysis conducted by the candidate showed that low perceived social support is the strongest predictor of poor response early in psychotherapy. These findings are in line with animal and human studies demonstrating the protective role of social rewards. Based on these observations, the candidate developed “Engage-S”, a social-reward based version of “Engage”, aimed to increase exposure to meaningful social interactions with others.  The training study proposes to examine whether social reward exposure in “Engage-S” enhances PVS abnormalities and improves mid- and late-life depression. The participants will be 60 middle-aged and older adults (age ≥ 50) with major depression who will be randomized to 9-weeks of “Engage-S” or to a Symptom Review and Psychoeducation (SRP) comparison condition. During treatment, we will examine target engagement of the PVS with rsFC, a behavioral activation scale (BADS), and performance on a novel social reward paradigm at baseline, 5 weeks, and 9 weeks. We will use computational methods to identify neuroimaging and behavioral profiles associated with treatment response.  The training plan consists of formal courses, structured tutorials, and hands-on methodological training that will offer the candidate knowledge and skills in: 1) Functional neuroanatomy of depression and aging; 2) Use of fMRI to assess target engagement during psychotherapies for mid- and late-life depression; 3) Computational modeling for the identification of clinical and neuroimaging predictors of treatment response that can be used to personalize psychotherapy; and 4) Generate preliminary data for an R-series experimental therapeutics target engagement application. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Abnormalities in the Positive Valence System (PVS) are associated with depressive symptoms and reduced behavioral activation in mid- and late-life. This study will investigate the engagement of the PVS during exposure to social rewards, part of a novel streamlined psychotherapy for mid- and late-life depression. Use of computational modeling will enable identification of neuroimaging and behavioral profiles associated with greater treatment response, and may guide future personalization of psychotherapy.",Positive valence systems engagement during social reward exposure psychotherapy for mid- and late-life depression,10191051,K23MH123864,"['Addictive Behavior', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Animals', 'Behavioral', 'Clinical', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Elderly', 'Exposure to', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Geriatric Psychiatry', 'Human', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Investigational Therapies', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Participant', 'Performance', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positive Valence', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Psychotherapy', 'Randomized', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Social Interaction', 'Social support', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technical Expertise', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'base', 'biosignature', 'career', 'career development', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'evidence base', 'financial incentive', 'geriatric depression', 'geriatric major depression', 'improved', 'improved functioning', 'middle age', 'neural network', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'patient oriented research', 'patient subsets', 'psychoeducation', 'random forest', 'response', 'reward circuitry', 'skills', 'social', 'theories', 'therapeutic target', 'treatment response']",NIMH,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,K23,2021,191063

"BRINGING MODERN DATA SCIENCE TOOLS TO BEAR ON ENVIRONMENTAL MIXTURES Project Summary: Bringing Modern Data Science Tools to Bear on Environmental Mixtures Environmental exposures often cumulate in particular geographies, and the nature of the complex mixtures that characterize these exposures remains understudied. In addition, adverse environmental exposures often occur in communities facing multiple social stressors such as deteriorating housing, inadequate access to health care, poor schools, high unemployment, crime, and poverty – all of which may compound the effects of environmental exposures. Our central objective is to develop new data architecture, statistical, and machine learning methods to assess how exposure to environmental mixtures shapes educational outcomes in the presence or absence of social stress. We focus on air pollution mixtures, childhood lead exposure, and social stressors. We will implement our proposed work in North Carolina (NC), a state characterized by diverse environmental features, industrial activities, and airsheds typified by varying pollution emission sources and resulting pollutant mixtures. To accomplish this central objective, we will first develop, document, and disseminate methods for building space-time environmental and social data architectures. We will implement this for all of NC, incorporating data on air pollution, lead exposure risk, and social exposures from 1990-2015+ (dataset 1). Second, we will refine methods for linking unrelated datasets to build a space-time child movement and outcome data architecture (dataset 2). Third, we will connect exposures (dataset 1) and outcomes (dataset 2) data via shared geography and temporality into a single, comprehensive geodatabase. Fourth, we will implement increasingly complex methods to assess the effect of environmental mixtures in the presence or absence of social stressors on early childhood educational outcomes. We will document and disseminate all of the underlying methodological work via public website. The proposed work leverages a rich array of data resources already available to the investigators (with some significantly post-processed) and allows tracking of children across space and time. Our team brings tools from modern data science (hierarchical Bayesian methods with variable selection, spatial point process models, machine learning) to bear on the critical question of how environmental mixtures shape child outcomes directly and differentially in the presence of social stress. Project Narrative Environmental exposure mixtures, especially when coupled with social stressors, have the potential to compromise developmental outcomes in children, but have been understudied. We will use a unique longitudinal dataset that tracks children from birth through early elementary school, in combination with new tools from modern data science, to disentangle the complex effects of these mixtures on educational outcomes.",BRINGING MODERN DATA SCIENCE TOOLS TO BEAR ON ENVIRONMENTAL MIXTURES,10304211,R01ES028819,"['Address', 'Air', 'Air Pollutants', 'Air Pollution', 'Architecture', 'Bayesian Method', 'Biological Availability', 'Biological Factors', 'Birth', 'Birth Records', 'Carbon Monoxide', 'Censuses', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Cox Models', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Exposure to', 'Gaussian model', 'Genetic', 'Geography', 'Housing', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mothers', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Neighborhoods', 'Nitrogen Dioxide', 'North Carolina', 'Nursery Schools', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Output', 'Ozone', 'Particle Size', 'Particulate Matter', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Pollution', 'Poverty', 'Process', 'Relative Risks', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Schools', 'Shapes', 'Siblings', 'Social Environment', 'Source', 'Sulfur Dioxide', 'System', 'Taxes', 'Time', 'Unemployment', 'Ursidae Family', 'Validation', 'Work', 'cohort', 'data resource', 'deprivation', 'early childhood', 'elementary school', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'health care availability', 'indexing', 'lead exposure', 'longitudinal dataset', 'machine learning method', 'pollutant', 'programs', 'rural environment', 'simulation', 'social', 'social stress', 'social stressor', 'statistical and machine learning', 'tool', 'urban setting', 'web site']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME,R01,2021,487253
"Developing deep learning algorithms for studying infant brain and behavior relationships Project Summary Infants communicate to their caregivers that they need food by crying. This represents our very first social interaction that lays the foundation for a healthy life by acquiring nutrition for growth and establishing a strong social bond with caregivers. Infants that cannot regulate their nutrition are at risk for malnourishment or obesity, whose deleterious effects will negatively impact the wellness of these individuals for their lifetime. Abnormalities in social recognition and communication, like those found in autism spectrum disorders, also become apparent during infancy. Despite the critical importance of infants communicating nutritional need to caregivers, the neuronal basis remains unknown. To address this deficit, I propose to study social tadpoles that beg their parents for food by dancing. Tadpoles use this begging display to encode nutritional state, enabling us to quantify hunger- based communication. These tadpoles are translucent, allowing us to visualize the development and activity of neurons in the brain. I am combining this novel model system and behavioral paradigm with advanced neurogenetic tools to interrogate the neuronal substrates of hunger-based communication. I will examine whether nutritional quality influences the development of neurons that regulating feeding and communication with in vivo brain imaging. I will also test for a functional role of these neuronal cell-types in begging behavior using a high throughput behavior assay, whole brain clearing and immunohistochemistry, and cell-specific manipulations of neuronal activity. As social recognition is important for establishing parent-offspring bonds, I will then use in vivo neural activity imaging to determine how tadpoles recognize their parents using multi-modal sensory integration. Completion of these experiments will transform our understanding of a social behavior critical for infant survival and life-long wellbeing. There is a pressing need for this research because there are currently no established models for studying the neural mechanisms of infant communication of hunger. This work is important to public health because some of the most prevalent disorders afflicting children in the United States are eating related disorders and conditions involving abnormalities in social recognition and communication, such as autism spectrum disorders. More research on infant feeding and communication is needed to better understand these pathologies in the youngest members of our society. Narrative Communication of nutritional need during infancy is our very first social interaction, laying the foundation for a healthy life by acquiring nutrition for growth and establishing strong social bonds with caregivers. The proposed work uses a unique biological model – social tadpoles that communicate nutritional need to their caregivers – to uncover how infants evaluate their nutritional state, recognize their caregivers, and communicate that they need food. These studies have implications for informing preventative strategies and treatments for childhood obesity and autism spectrum disorders, two of the most prevalent diseases afflicting the youngest members of our society.",Developing deep learning algorithms for studying infant brain and behavior relationships,10263607,DP2HD102042,"['Address', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Caregivers', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Communication', 'Critical Thinking', 'Crying', 'Dancing', 'Data Scientist', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Eating', 'Food', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hunger', 'Image', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Behavior', 'Life', 'Methodology', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Nutritional', 'Obesity', 'Parents', 'Pathology', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive treatment', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Interaction', 'Societies', 'Study models', 'Tadpoles', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Woman', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'cell type', 'computational neuroscience', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'experimental study', 'feeding', 'in vivo', 'infancy', 'member', 'multimodality', 'neurogenetics', 'neuromechanism', 'neuron development', 'novel', 'nutrition', 'obesity in children', 'offspring', 'parent grant', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory integration', 'skills', 'social', 'social attachment', 'success', 'tool']",NICHD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,DP2,2021,86547
"An Electronic Health Record-Based Tool to Identify Newly Diagnosed Breast Cancer Patients at Risk of Low Social Support ABSTRACT Social support, a social determinant of health (SDoH), is a definitive predictor of breast cancer (BC) treatment and mortality outcomes. Because of the recognition that social support is critical to BC patient outcomes, clinicians within Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) have documented information on social support in the electronic health record (EHR) since the advent of Epic in 2005. However, no EHR-based social support measure currently exists to help clinicians identify patients at high risk of low social support. Such a measure has high relevance for addressing racial/ethnic disparities in BC treatment and outcomes. Therefore, we propose to develop an Electronic Health Record Social Support Patient Risk Tool (EHR-SUPPORT) that could be used to identify women with BC at risk of low social support for referral to social support resources. We propose to: 1) Identify terms in the EHR, based on theory and prior literature, and informed by KPNC stakeholders in BC care, that reflect structural and/or functional social support, and have been associated with BC treatment and outcomes; 2) Develop EHR-SUPPORT, using structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data (to include natural language processing of text) that identifies patients at risk of low social support, overall and by race/ethnicity, and validate the measure against published social support measures; and 3) Evaluate associations of EHR-SUPPORT and its component variables with BC treatment (surgery and chemotherapy delays, nonadherence to hormonal therapy) and BC-specific and total mortality, overall and by race/ethnicity in 44,348 women diagnosed with stage I-IV BC within Kaiser Permanente Northern California between 2006- 2023 including 3,450 Black, 4,441 Hispanic, 6,571 Asian women, and 28,589 non-Latina white women. In an exploratory aim, we will develop, with KP clinician stakeholders, steps to the implementation of EHR- SUPPORT. We will review 100 medical records (25 in each race/ethnic group) within two months of diagnosis, informed by investigator expertise and clinician stakeholders, to develop terms used to describe patient support. In addition to developing structured data, we will use natural language processing of text fields to further develop social support indicators (Aim 1). EHR-SUPPORT will be computed from social support indicators; we will use linear and logistic regression to validate the developed measure against established social support measures in Pathways, a well-established cohort of 4,505 women with BC and use factor analytic and confirmatory factor analytic methods as well as ROC curves to further evaluate the score (Aim 2). We will use linear, logistic, and Cox proportional hazards regression to evaluate associations in Aim 3. The unique convergence of EHR and cohort data provides the first opportunity to develop and validate an EHR- based social support measure in in diverse women with BC, adjusted for an extensive set of covariates. This work is central to identifying patients at elevated risk of low social support and to enhancing social support- cancer research needed to improve clinical care and reduce BC disparities. NARRATIVE Social support, a social determinant of health (SDoH), is a definitive predictor of breast cancer (BC) treatment and mortality outcomes and is critical to racial/ethnic disparities in breast cancer (BC) treatment and mortality outcomes. This study will develop and validate an Electronic Health Record Social Support Patient Risk Tool (EHR-SUPPORT) in 44,348 women diagnosed with BC from Kaiser Permanente Northern California.

"Social-Affective Vulnerability to Suicidality among LGBTQ Young Adults: Proximal and Distal Factors Project Summary/Abstract Rates of suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STB) among young adults have reached a crisis level, especially for those in the LGBTQ (i.e., lesbian, gay, bisexual, queer, questioning and/or transgender) population, who face social stigma in addition to the typical developmental challenges. Although we know the general risk factors for suicide, those have limited utility in predicting how, when, and in whom suicide occurs. It is critically important to consider the role of social context because STB often occurs in response to a recent social threat event such as rejection and could be more likely in those who have altered sensitivity of neural social circuitry. The proposed R01 study in response to RFA MH-20-327 builds on social models such as Minority Stress Theory and the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide and examines social risk factors of STB from distal to proximal levels. The overarching goal is to predict change in STB, including cumulative intensity of STB and transition from suicidal thoughts to behaviors, on a time scale from hours to days to months. We propose that in LGBTQ young adults, STB occurs through social processing and regulation of socially generated negative affect (e.g., shame). Specifically, we examine the distal vulnerability factors of sensitivity in social brain circuitry and negative urgency, or the tendency toward impulsive behavior in the face of painful negative affect, and the proximal, time-varying factors of sleep dysregulation and social experiences (e.g., rejection). The study will test the association of these distal and proximal factors with STB; differences in these factors between LGBTQ young adults with vs. without STB; the interplay of distal and proximal factors; and the role of LGBTQ-related characteristics (e.g., victimization, outness) in STB. The study will include 130 participants age 18-30, all of whom identify as LGBTQ and 2/3 of whom have recurrent suicidal ideation and lifetime history of suicidal behavior. Participants will complete a detailed interview of STB, an fMRI scan using social threat paradigms, a 3-month protocol of actigraphy and smartphone-based assessment, and a follow-up interview at 6 months. Smartphone data will include ecological momentary assessment of social threat experiences and STB, as well as passively collected sensor data (e.g., social media app use, texting activity). Traditional and machine learning quantitative techniques will be applied to determine contributions of distal and proximal factors to STB (e.g., occurrence of suicidal behavior), individual differences in risk factors, and contributions of neural, sleep, social, clinical, and demographic factors to STB. The study will elucidate the role of modifiable risk factors in STB and have relevance to clinical neuroscience, suicidology, and prevention efforts. Project Narrative Suicide in LGBTQ young adults has reached a crisis level, but our ability to predict and prevent suicide has not improved in 50 years. We will use brain imaging, actigraphy, and smartphone technology to measure critical social precipitants of suicidality and their interaction with general risk factors. With machine learning, a technique based on artificial intelligence, we will combine these sources of data to determine the way suicidal thoughts and behaviors develop over hours, days, and months.",Social-Affective Vulnerability to Suicidality among LGBTQ Young Adults: Proximal and Distal Factors,10106761,R01MH124900,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Brain imaging', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computational Technique', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Demographic Factors', 'Development', 'Distal', 'Distress', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Emergency Situation', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Exclusion', 'Face', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Hospitalization', 'Hotlines', 'Hour', 'Impulsive Behavior', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Lesbian Gay Bisexual', 'Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Queer', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Health', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Neurosciences', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatry', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Same-sex', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Shame', 'Sleep', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Social Environment', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Stress', 'Suicide', 'Suicide prevention', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Text Messaging', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Victimization', 'Visit', 'actigraphy', 'affective neuroscience', 'base', 'behavior change', 'brain circuitry', 'emerging adult', 'experience', 'family support', 'follow-up', 'functional MRI scan', 'health disparity', 'longitudinal design', 'modifiable risk', 'negative affect', 'neuromechanism', 'queer', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensor', 'sleep quality', 'smartphone based assessment', 'social', 'social media', 'social model', 'social stigma', 'suicidal behavior', 'theories', 'trait', 'transgender', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,754061
"Studying how the hippocampal-prefrontal-hypothalamic circuit encodes social dominance Project Summary Social deficits are common in psychiatric disorders and available treatments are limited. Our lack of basic knowledge on how the brain controls social behaviors makes it challenging to develop therapeutics for social deficits. For numerous animal species, social rank dictates many aspects of behavior, such as access to resources and resilience to stress. Individuals with higher social rank typically win more often during social conflicts (e.g. food competition) and show more agonistic behaviors; collectivity referred to as dominance behaviors. Cross-species evidence suggests that the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) plays an important role in social dominance. However, exactly how the mPFC encodes social rank and which mPFC inputs and outputs contribute to dominance behaviors is unknown. Multiple studies show that the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) is necessary for social memory, and more recently, a study showed that this role involves vHPC input to the mPFC. Furthermore, preliminary data suggest that the projection from the mPFC to the lateral hypothalamus (LH) modulates social dominance behavior. These findings in combination with the literature suggest a model in which the mPFC receives social memory information from the vHPC and guides social behaviors via modulation of LH GABAergic and glutamatergic subpopulations. Progress in uncovering neural correlates of social behavior has been limited by the tools used to characterize murine social behavior, since existing social assays lack trial- structure needed for statistical power and common measurements of social behavior are simplistic (e.g. sniffing). Overcoming this challenge required developing a trial-based social competition assay in which mice compete against cagemates for a reward signaled by a tone. Due to its trial structure, this assay facilitates the quantification of social behaviors and subsequently the identification of neural correlates for social dominance. In this assay, dominant mice win most of the rewards across trials, occupy the reward port and displace mice from the reward port more often than subordinates. Machine learning approaches will be used to profile the behavioral differences seen across social rank during the competition assay. Utilizing this ethologically relevant social competition assay, circuit manipulations, in vivo neural recording methods and machine learning allows testing the hypothesis that the tripartite vHPC-mPFC-LH circuit encodes social dominance. Altogether, this research will provide a new approach to study social dominance and will further our understanding of how the distributed circuits of the mPFC modulate social behavior. Furthermore, pinpointing the neural circuits underlying social behaviors will facilitate identification of potential therapeutics for social deficits in psychiatric disorders. Finally, completion of this research will provide training opportunities in statistical approaches for behavioral analysis and new circuit dissection tools, which are essential for the candidate to become an expert in social neuroscience and to start a successful independent research program. Project Narrative Social behavior deficits are key features of many psychiatric disorders, yet little is known about how the brain controls normal social behaviors. I propose to dissect the role of the medial prefrontal cortex circuits in social dominance by combining wireless electrophysiology, calcium imaging, optogenetics and machine learning. This study will broaden our understanding of how neural circuits control normal social behaviors and will contribute to the identification of novel interventions for social deficits.",Studying how the hippocampal-prefrontal-hypothalamic circuit encodes social dominance,10167793,K99MH124435,"['Affect', 'Agonistic Behavior', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Bilateral', 'Biological Assay', 'Calcium', 'Cells', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Dissection', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Food', 'Frequencies', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Mus', 'Opsin', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Probability', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Dominance', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tube', 'Wireless Technology', 'base', 'cell cortex', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'mind control', 'neural circuit', 'neural correlate', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'optogenetics', 'programs', 'recruit', 'redshift', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'social', 'social competition', 'social deficits', 'social interventions', 'social neuroscience', 'tool', 'training opportunity', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,SALK INSTITUTE FOR BIOLOGICAL STUDIES,K99,2021,123390
"Social Determinants of Health and Novel Prediction of Cardiovascular Health from Young Adulthood to Middle Age in the CARDIA Study Project Summary In the U.S., approximately 840,000 Americans die from cardiovascular disease (CVD) each year. The prevalence of CVD is on the rise and widespread disparities in CVD exist across economic, racial, and ethnic groups. In order to address the rising prevalence of CVD and persistent disparities, there has been a shift in focus to public health strategies addressing cardiovascular health (CVH). CVH is a broader and more positive construct beyond the absence of CVD. Despite this recent focus on improving CVH, widespread disparities still exist. Social determinants of health (SDOH) may be important contributors to these continued disparities. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines SDOH as the “structural determinants and conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age.” There has been limited work in studying how a diverse set of SDOH change over time and perform in the prediction of CVH. To address this need, we will identify patterns of SDOH exposure over time and determine if the addition of SDOH variables allows for better prediction of an individual's CVH status. The primary hypothesis is that a diverse set of SDOH will be associated with and improve the prediction of CVH, independent of baseline CVH and other covariates. To examine this hypothesis, we will pursue the following Specific Aims: 1) identify patterns of SDOH exposure up to age 50 and define exposure subgroups and 2) determine whether overall and domain-specific patterns of SDOH exposures from young adulthood to middle age, identified in Aim 1, are associated with and improve the prediction of CVH and its component metrics. We will utilize the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study, a prospective cohort study with detailed information on cardiovascular risk factors and disease in a geographically and racially diverse sample of young adults. In Aim 1, we will use a novel sequential pattern mining method to identify the associations among SDOH and determine the SDOH exposure patterns from baseline to age 50. The Aim 1 SDOH exposure definitions will be included as predictors of CVH at age 50 and beyond using supervised machine learning techniques. By including SDOH in predictive models, health services professionals and clinicians may have an improved understanding of patients at high-risk for low CVH and may better tailor social and clinical interventions to each patient's needs. If awarded, this fellowship will allow me to contribute novel research to the SDOH and cardiovascular health fields, gain competency in new research skills, and improve my writing and presentation skills. The completion of this project and training will prepare me for my long-term career goal of becoming an independent research scientist in an academic setting, studying SDOH and using data science and informatics tools to improve public health. Project Narrative The incorporation of social determinants of health (SDOH) in predictive models for cardiovascular health (CVH) may help health services professionals and clinicians in identifying patients at high-risk for low CVH. This has important public health implications because social and clinical interventions may be tailored to each patient's needs. This research may also help to identify which SDOH are predictive of CVH from young adulthood to middle age, allowing public health professionals to target specific SDOH through directed social, behavioral, and policy-related interventions.",Social Determinants of Health and Novel Prediction of Cardiovascular Health from Young Adulthood to Middle Age in the CARDIA Study,10067371,F31HL151178,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Age', 'American', 'American Heart Association', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body mass index', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Cholesterol', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic group', 'Event', 'Fellowship', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Health Services', 'Health Status', 'Health behavior', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neighborhoods', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Prevalence', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Smoking Status', 'Social Identification', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'Writing', 'age group', 'base', 'biracial', 'built environment', 'burden of illness', 'cardiovascular health', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'career', 'cohort', 'fasting plasma glucose', 'good diet', 'health disparity', 'health economics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'informatics tool', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'middle age', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'racial difference', 'racial diversity', 'secondary analysis', 'sex', 'skills', 'social', 'social factors', 'social health determinants', 'supervised learning', 'theories', 'training opportunity', 'young adult']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,F31,2021,41249
"Neural, computational and behavioral characterization of dynamic social behavior in borderline and avoidant personality disorder Project Summary Severe impairments in interpersonal functioning are hallmarks of personality disorders. Borderline personality disorder (BPD), for example, is characterized by inability to maintain relationships, inflexibility in dealing with changes in relationships, and heightened needs to control and manipulate others. Avoidant personality disorder (AvPD), in contrast, is primarily marked by social withdrawal and avoidance, as well as reduced sense of control in social relationships. While social neuroscience has been growing rapidly in recent years, the complexity of human social interactions has not been well quantified with computational models, particularly as applied to personality disorders. The overarching aim of this project is to utilize novel computational models and paradigms, combined with 7-Tesla imaging and brain connectivity measures, to capture the neural computations underlying proactive and dynamic social behaviors in BPD, AvPD, and healthy controls (HC; n=60 per group). Specifically, we will focus on two novel and complex social behaviors that mimic real-life social interaction: 1) social controllability, the ability to exert control over one’s social environment and, 2) social navigation, the process of navigating dynamically changing social relationships. In Aim 1, we will examine the computational and neural mechanisms of social controllability in BPD and AvPD using a social exchange paradigm in which participants either could or could not influence their partners’ monetary offers in a novel computational framework. We will capture key parameters such as estimated controllability (), sensitivity to norm violation (), and beliefs about control. In Aim 2, we will identify neurocomputational indices of dynamic social relationships in BPD and AvPD, using a novel social interaction game in which participants interact and develop relationships with virtual characters. We will devise novel measures that track the trajectories of social relationships and geometrically quantify the overall structure of individuals’ two-dimensional social space framed by power and affiliation. In Aim 3, we will use state-of-the-art machine learning approaches and the neurocomputational parameters derived from Aims 1 & 2 to predict each participant’s diagnosis/group label (BPD, AvPD, or HC) and patients’ symptom severity. Upon successful completion of these aims, this project will provide important neurocomputational characterization for proactive social behaviors and how they might break down in BPD and AvPD, potentially breaking new grounds and filling critical knowledge gaps for social neuroscience and computational psychiatry research. The resulting paradigms, models, and findings will be critical for a wide range of personality and other psychiatric disorders. Thus, the proposed neurocomputational framework could parameterize social interactions, providing novel quantitative measures of social pathology, treatment change, and the nature of patient- psychotherapist interactions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Both borderline and avoidant personality disorders are marked by profound impairments in interpersonal functioning. However, the brain mechanisms underlying these social deficits are not well understood. The goal of this project is to better elucidate how the brain is involved in complex social interactions and the clinical relevance of these processes for personality disorders.","Neural, computational and behavioral characterization of dynamic social behavior in borderline and avoidant personality disorder",10234509,R01MH123069,"['Assertiveness', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Borderline Personality Disorder', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Failure', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Personality', 'Personality Disorders', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychiatry', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Resolution', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Change', 'Social Controls', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Planning', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'computer framework', 'geometric structure', 'indexing', 'neural circuit', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'social', 'social anxiety', 'social deficits', 'social learning', 'social neuroscience', 'social relationships', 'social space', 'supervised learning', 'two-dimensional', 'unsupervised learning', 'virtual']",NIMH,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2021,648979
"Input-specific imaging and manipulation of synaptic plasticity underlying social memory Project Summary / Abstract Ascertaining the neural basis of behavior has been a cornerstone goal since the conception of neurobiology. While activity recording and loss-of-function studies have shed light on brain regions involved and necessary for the expression of certain behaviors, they are unable to determine the information each circuit is responsible for encoding. Therefore, when different nodes in the circuit are removed, the behavioral phenotype is often identical. Synaptic plasticity, the ability of synapses to change functional strength depending on experience, is considered the cellular correlate of learning and memory. Linking changes in the functional strength of synapses following behavior has begun to indicate what information circuits are responsible for encoding. To provide direct evidence, a tool that is able to modulate synaptic plasticity in specific circuit nodes during behavior is needed. The goal of this proposal is to create a photo-activatable inhibitor of presynaptic plasticity that will be input- and region- specific for use in behaving animals. The first aim of the proposal will create and screen constructs of photo-activatable PKI (paPKI) in their efficacy for the inhibition of protein kinase A, a kinase necessary for the induction of presynaptic plasticity. Light-dependency will be ensured and the construct will be evaluated based on its sensitivity and selectivity using advanced imaging techniques (2-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging) and biochemical assays. The second aim of the proposal will use paPKI to determine the role of specific circuit nodes in social memory. Input-specific modulation of plasticity will be paired with in depth behavioral analyses using computer vision to parse out subtle differences in social interaction. These aims directly address the BRAIN Initiative 2025 high priority goal #4: the modulation of neural activity with readouts of behavior using advanced computer vision techniques. The proposed fellowship project provides excellent training potential as it expands from the applicant’s current training in systems/circuit neuroscience to molecular and biophysical neuroscience. The project is an intersection between the mentor’s, Dr. Ryohei Yasuda, expertise in molecular mechanisms of synaptic plasticity and the development and advanced imaging of biomodulators and sensors, and the applicant’s expertise in circuitry underlying social memory, electrophysiology and behavioral analyses using computer vision. The Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience is an intensely collaborative environment filled with leaders in the field and exceptional resources, resulting in an institute that is highly productive and influential. This fellowship proposal presents excellent training potential and aims to produce tools that will advance the field. Project Narrative While the ability to discern an appropriate behavioral response during social encounters is of quintessential importance in communally living animals, the neural circuitry storing social memories that guide this behavioral choice are poorly understood. Here, we will harness and develop novel molecular tools to manipulate synaptic plasticity in an input-specific manner to discern the specific role of each node in a social memory circuit. Additionally, the tools developed in this proposal will be applicable to studies discerning the neural circuitry underlying other forms of learning and memory facilitating greater understanding of neural computations underlying behavior and how these may be altered in neuropsychiatric diseases.",Input-specific imaging and manipulation of synaptic plasticity underlying social memory,10163915,F32MH120872,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Animals', 'Assessment tool', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Response Modifiers', 'Biophysics', 'Brain region', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Conceptions', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Dorsal', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Ensure', 'Fellowship', 'Florida', 'Goals', 'Hela Cells', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Institutes', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Memory', 'Mentors', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Presynaptic Terminals', 'Protein Inhibition', 'Protein Kinase A Inhibitor', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Characteristics', 'Social Dominance', 'Social Interaction', 'Specificity', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Virus', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'behavioral response', 'calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II', 'cohort', 'collaborative environment', 'commune', 'experience', 'fluorescence lifetime imaging', 'hippocampal pyramidal neuron', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'link protein', 'loss of function', 'neural circuit', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuroregulation', 'neurotransmitter release', 'novel', 'optical fiber', 'postsynaptic', 'presynaptic', 'protein kinase inhibitor', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'sensor', 'social', 'social learning', 'tool', 'two-photon']",NIMH,MAX PLANCK FLORIDA CORPORATION,F32,2021,73562
"Mechanisms for internally and externally guided sensorimotor learning PROJECT SUMMARY Expressive social behaviors, including speech and music, are culturally transmitted from a tutor to a pupil. Such learning depends on a pupil’s ability to integrate social and sensory cues provided by a tutor performing the relevant behavior. Once learned, the underlying motor program must be coordinated with a range of innate motor programs to generate holistic behaviors necessary to effective social signaling. The central hypothesis that this proposal seeks to test is that the same brain circuitry that enables the pupil to integrate social and sensory cues from an adult tutor also function in the adult to enable integration of the learned and innate programs necessary to effective social signaling. In the past cycle, we discovered where neural signals encoding social and sensory cues provided by a tutor are integrated in the pupil’s brain. Specifically, we showed that neurons in a midbrain dopamine cell group (A11) in a juvenile songbird are selectively excited during interactions with a singing adult male tutor, and that pairing song playback with the optogenetically- triggered release of dopamine from A11 terminals in a sensorimotor cortical analogue (HVC) is sufficient to drive song copying. Despite these important insights, exactly when and how tutor experience transforms auditory and motor coding in HVC to facilitate vocal learning remains unknown. Therefore, in Aim 1 we will use multiphoton (2p) longitudinal imaging, fiber photometry to test the hypothesis that tutor experience rapidly strengthens the auditory and motor network in the pupil’s HVC. We will also use novel machine learning tools for vocal analysis and optogenetic methods to test the idea that these sensorimotor changes enable HVC to enhance the acoustic complexity of the pupil’s song, a first step in vocal copying. Our prior studies support the idea that social and auditory cues provided by the tutor drive coincident DA release and auditory synaptic activity in the pupil’s HVC, rapidly potentiating sensorimotor synapses in this region. Therefore, in Aim 2, we will use ex vivo channelrhodopsin circuit-mapping to test the hypothesis that coincident DA release and auditory synaptic actvity rapidly potentiates auditory synapses onto HVC interneurons, and that these effects are strongest during juvenile sensitive periods for learning. Notably, the courtship display of the adult songbird includes a learned song that is seamlessly coordinated with a variety of innate behaviors, including female- directed calling, orientation, and pursuit. In Preliminary Studies, we found that lesions of A11’s axon terminals in HVC of the adult male finch abolish female-directed singing without affecting his innate courtship behaviors. In contrast, selectively ablating A11 cell bodies abolished all of the male’s courtship behaviors. In Aim 3, we will map, monitor and manipulate A11’s projections to HVC and other motor centers to test the idea that A11 acts as a central hub to enable the seamless and rapid coordination of learned and innate motor programs in response to social cues provided by a nearby female. PROJECT NARRATIVE Social learning is the foundation for speech, music and athletics but full mastery of these complex behaviors requires the fluent coordination of learned and innate motor programs. The goal of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that a neural circuit comprising a midbrain dopamine cell group and its cortical and subcortical projections is crucial to social learning and the coordination of learned and innate motor programs.",Mechanisms for internally and externally guided sensorimotor learning,10305438,R01NS099288,"['Acoustic Stimulation', 'Acoustics', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Athletic', 'Auditory', 'Bathing', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Courtship', 'Cues', 'Dopamine', 'Emotional', 'Facial Expression', 'Female', 'Fiber', 'Finches', 'Foundations', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Image', 'Influentials', 'Instinct', 'Interneurons', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Midbrain structure', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Music', 'Neurons', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Photometry', 'Preparation', 'Presynaptic Terminals', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Property', 'Prosencephalon', 'Pupil', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Social Behavior', 'Songbirds', 'Speech', 'Synapses', 'Testing', 'Whole-Cell Recordings', 'analog', 'brain circuitry', 'dopaminergic neuron', 'experience', 'insight', 'learning outcome', 'machine learning method', 'male', 'molecular phenotype', 'motor learning', 'neural circuit', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'programs', 'response', 'serial imaging', 'social', 'social learning', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'tutoring', 'vocal learning', 'zebra finch']",NINDS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,354988
"When dementia caregiving ends: The role of patient-caregiver social connection in caregivers' health and well-being PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Dementia and other neurodegenerative diseases lead to profound cognitive, emotional, and functional impairments. As these diseases progress, the person with dementia (PWD) becomes increasingly dependent on a caregiver for functional, psychological, and economic assistance. It is well-documented that caring for a PWD is associated with considerable declines in health and well-being. Evidence suggests that many caregivers continue to experience these adverse effects for years after caregiving has ended (after the death of the PWD), though this area has received less attention. There is also striking variability in the extent to which caregivers experience these consequences – both during caregiving and after it has ended. Research on the sources of these individual differences has largely focused on factors related to the external environment, the PWD, or the caregiver that contribute to increased vulnerability in caregivers. Although research has linked PWD-caregiver relationship quality with declines in caregiver well-being, little is known about the specific interpersonal mechanisms that contribute to caregiver outcomes. For example, the positive emotional qualities of the PWD-caregiver social connection may buffer against the negative effects of caregiving stress, whereas lower quality social connection may drive increases in caregivers’ loneliness. In the proposed research, I will measure PWD-caregiver social connection through observational measures derived from basic affective science, including dyadic coding of emotional behavior in a laboratory-based interaction between PWDs and caregivers (Study 1; N = 186) and text analysis of emotional language caregivers used when describing a recent time they felt connected to the PWD (Study 2; N = 533). I will then determine the impact of PWD-caregiver social connection on caregivers’ health and well-being (Aim 1), both concurrently (in current caregivers) and longitudinally (in former caregivers, after caregiving has ended). Additionally, I will compare the relative strength of these associations between current and former caregivers, and I will investigate possible mechanisms (e.g., loneliness) through which PWD-caregiver social connection is linked to caregivers’ health and well-being. I will then evaluate the predictive value of PWD-caregiver social connection on caregivers’ health and well-being, above and beyond an optimal set of predictors identified through machine learning (Aim 2). The proposed dissertation research will prepare me to conduct future studies investigating the socioemotional mechanisms that may influence caregivers’ health trajectories. This F31 will provide the necessary support to accomplish the following research goals: (1) to further expertise in basic affective science methodologies (e.g., dyadic behavioral coding, text analysis); (2) to achieve advanced proficiency in statistical techniques for longitudinal and machine learning analyses; and (3) to enhance knowledge of neurodegenerative disease, including neuropsychology and differential diagnosis. PROJECT NARRATIVE Dementia and other neurodegenerative disease are progressive, debilitating illnesses that require assistance from loved ones serving as caregivers. Caring for a person with dementia is associated with significantly heightened risk for adverse consequences, such as reduced health and well-being, which may persist for years after caregiving has ended. Identifying mechanisms that convey risk for the long-term adverse effects of caregiving can facilitate developing more effective interventions with major public health benefits.",When dementia caregiving ends: The role of patient-caregiver social connection in caregivers' health and well-being,10235400,F31AG072891,"['Accounting', 'Adverse effects', 'Adverse event', 'Affective', 'Aging', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavioral', 'Buffers', 'California', 'Caregiver well-being', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Data Collection', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Dementia caregivers', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Ecosystem', 'Elderly', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Loneliness', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Play', 'Predictive Value', 'Progressive Disease', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Social Network', 'Social support', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'care giving burden', 'caregiving', 'dementia caregiving', 'effective intervention', 'emotional behavior', 'emotional functioning', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'functional disability', 'loved ones', 'positive emotional state', 'prevent', 'psychologic', 'resilience', 'satisfaction', 'skills', 'social', 'social relationships']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,F31,2021,46036
"Neural Circuit Mechanisms Mediating TMS and Oxytocin Effects on Social Cognition We are requesting an increase in the yearly direct costs to support the aims of the MERIT renewal. What we propose is a dramatic leap into the future of social neuroscience and lies at the bleeding edge of current technology. The proposed research is innovative, ambitious, and necessary for understanding how primate, and by extension human, brains enable appropriate social behavior in the real world. Our proposal advances understanding of how primate brains generate appropriate social behavior through a tightly-integrated, ambitious set of 4 specific aims combining simultaneous wireless neurophysiological recordings in multiple freely-moving monkeys interacting naturally in varied social contexts, semi-to-fully-automated quantification of social behavior using computer vision, pharmacological manipulations, and reversible perturbations of neural activity.
