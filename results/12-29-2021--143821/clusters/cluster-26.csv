"Cheminformatics of Allosteric mGluR Modulation promotes Therapeutic Development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Selective potentiators of the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype mGluR5 have exciting potential for development of novel treatment strategies for schizophrenia and other disorders that disrupt cognitive func-tion. The latest generation of selective mGluR5 potentiators is based on the lead compound CDPPB and features systemically active compounds with long half-lives that cross the blood-brain barrier. A high-throughput screen (HTS) for mGluR5 potentiators at Vanderbilt's screening center revealed a large and diverse set of about 1400 substances (1% hit rate) whose activity was validated in independent experiments.  A previous exploratory research grant ""Novel Schizophrenia Therapeutics by Virtual High-Throughput Screening"" (R21 MH082254) enabled testing of 813 compounds predicted through cheminformatics. 252 of these compounds were confirmed as active PAMs equaling an enrichment of >30 when compared with the original screen. The present proposal seeks to leverage these proof-of-principle results for the development of a tailored cheminformatics framework for drug discovery of allosteric modulators of brain GPCRs, apply these tools to inform an existing therapeutic discovery program of mGluR5 potentiators at Vanderbilt University, and disseminate the methods broadly through the NIH molecular libraries program.  The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the complex relationship between chemical structure and biological activity of mGluR5 potentiators observed in this HTS can be used to generate a pharmacophore of the mGluR5 allosteric site. This map of steric and electronic features necessary for optimal interaction of modulators with mGluR5 will not only inform our understanding of the allosteric modulation of brain GPCRs. The methods proposed overcome limitations of present cheminformatics techniques by enabling identification of novel chemotypes through virtual screening (scaffold hoping), and allowing design of focused libraries in hit-to- lead optimization of novel schizophrenia therapeutics.  The generalizbility of the approach will be tested through application on negative modulators of mGluR5, a potential novel treatment strategy of fragile X syndrome, a CNS disorder associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) among multiple other symptoms. The developed applications will be made freely and readily accessible for academic research. The employed QSAR models require no crystal structure of the target brain GPCR. Hence the method can be readily applied to membrane proteins-such as GPCRs-which are target of 40-50% of modern medicinal drugs.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Ligands for specific mGluR subtypes have potential for treatment of a wide variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders.

"An automated high throughput phenotypic screen for schistosomiasis drug discovery    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schistosomiasis is a tropical parasitic disease infecting over 200 million people. Treatment relies on a single drug, praziquantel (PZQ). In the absence of back-up drugs with PZQ's therapeutic spectrum, the risk of resistance to PZQ and eventual drug failure is a major concern. Traditional phenotypic screens, using adult- stage S. mansoni, are low-throughput and incompatible with modern high-throughput screen (HTS) systems. In keeping with the NIAID's mission, the present proposal aims to turn a newly developed, moderate- throughput phenotypic screen (MTS), into a fully automated, quantitative HTS to accelerate drug discovery for this infectious disease. The proposal involves three PIs with ongoing collaborations and respective biological, screening-technology and bio-computational skills who are focused on just this goal. As a first research track for this proposal, we will utilize in-house automation and a high-content screening (HCS) system to significantly increase throughput over our published MTS approach. The proposal will involve; expanding robotic plating of the parasite, developing protocols for bright-field and fluorescence-based microscopy and adapting commercial image-analysis software to identify (segment), quantitatively describe and track the motion of parasites with a view to prioritizing compounds for further pre-clinical development. Because commercial HCS analysis tools are not likely optimized for recording the complex and dynamic phenotypes displayed by this multicellular parasite, we will also pursue a second and parallel track of research. Specifically, we will develop de novo an automated image-analysis screening technology to define, identify, and quantify the range of phenotypic responses (morphological and behavioral) possible in this parasite. Ultimately, both the experimental and computation tracks will together produce a standardized HTS protocol and a comprehensive, quantitative suite of image-analysis programs to categorize parasite phenotypes. Such rigor will facilitate the screening of large numbers of potential compounds and their prioritization into the secondary and tertiary screening assays available in-house. We also intend to make the algorithmic framework including its methods and implementations, publicly available.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The major goal of the project is to turn a moderate-throughput phenotypic screen (MTS) system for schistosomiasis, into a fully automated, quantitative high-throughput screen (HTS).

"NOVEL PARADIGMS FOR DRUG DISCOVERY: COMPUTATIONAL MULTITARGET SCREENING    DESCRIPTION   Abstract:   We will create a comprehensive computational drug discovery platform by enhancing a novel technique for a dynamic, fragment based, screening of small molecule compounds against the three dimensional structures of multiple protein targets from infectious disease causing pathogens, followed by prospective in vitro and in vivo experimental verification. We will further modify the most promising lead candidates computationally and screen them against all known human proteins and variants simultaneously to assess for side effects against essential proteins, and to ensure that they possess safe and effective absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion profiles against major proteins in known drug delivery pathways. The top ranking leads will again be experimentally verified, and the computational protocol will be itera- tively refined using machine learning techniques. We will initially focus on discovering preclinical drug candidates against infections caused by all eight human herpes viruses (HHVs). This virus family infects billions of humans worldwide every year and is the source of significant mortality in immunocompromised patients. Broad spectrum therapeutics against these key pathogens will benefit the entire global community. In contrast to other computational efforts, my group has successfuly applied and experimentally verified their predictions of inhibitors to treat herpes, malaria, and dengue. This was accomplished at a fraction of the time, effort, and cost typically required by pharmaceutical companies. Our significant successes thus far attest to the efficacy of our drug discovery technologies. The Pioneer Award funds will therefore allow us to bridge the gap of discovering computationally predicted lead compounds and demonstrating their preclinical effectiveness for further clinical and therapeutic use.

"Validation of a Vascular Health Profile for Cardiovascular Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This application address broad challenge area ""(03) Biomarker Discovery and Validation"" and specific challenge research topic ""03-HL-101* Identify and validate clinically relevant, quantifiable biomarkers of diagnostic and therapeutic responses for blood, vascular, cardiac, and respiratory tract dysfunction."" Treatment paradigms have evolved from studies of patients who, despite similar presentations, may have experienced disparate environmental exposures or clinical courses and may have varied underlying pathobiologies. A developing and exciting biomarker strategy is the measurement of microparticles (MPs) and assessment of circulating progenitor and mature endothelial cells. All eukaryotic cells shed MPs in response to activation or apoptosis and elevation of plasma MPs, particularly those of endothelial origin, reflects cellular injury and is a surrogate marker for vascular dysfunction. Microparticles have been enumerated in a number of conditions where vascular dysfunction and inflammation are important pathophysiological mechanisms, for example coronary artery disease or thrombotic microangiopathies. We recently completed a pilot study evaluating levels of MPs in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) and compared flow cytometry results with those of a non cell specific Enzyme Linked ImmunoSorbent assay (ELISA). The ELISA assay results correlated with flow cytometry results but did not distinguish the cell of origin where the micoparticle originated. The overall goal of this study is to develop and validate a novel cell-based high throughput, high content, vascular health profile analysis that provides a signature for individuals at high risk for cardiovascular events. A unique biocomputational approach at Penn called cytometric fingerprinting will be used to identify populations of cells. The aims are: 1: To develop and validate a single platform high throughput, multiplexed flow cytometry assay for cell specific MPs, endothelial progenitor cells and hematopoietic progenitors. 2: To develop and validate a cell specific ELISA biomarker assay for MPs in healthy group of subjects and patients with DM and correlate with an independent flow cytometry test for EPCs and HSCs as a dual platform measure of vascular health. 3: To use high order informatics to derive a signature profile from the results of Aims 1 and 2. Such a high throughput high information content approach may prove to be clinically useful in discerning laboratory markers that would be useful for guiding therapy of patients with DM. Penn Medicine contributes substantially to the local economy. In 2008, Penn Medicine created 37,000 jobs and $5.4 billion in regional economic activity, with the area's highly trained workforce producing more than 24,600 applications for just 840 open Penn staff research positions. The current proposal will create or retain 3 jobs. If successfully validated, the biomarker technology proposed could be commercialized, create thousands of jobs in the health care industry and potentially prevent costly hospital admissions. Also, an ELISA for MPs could provide an early evaluation of impact of novel pharmaceutical compounds on vascular health.

"High Throughput Screen for Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myotonic dystrophy (DM1) is the most common adult onset muscular dystrophy in humans. Currently, there is no cure or an FDA approved drug for DM1 and related diseases. The molecular basis of DM1 is the expansion of a CTG-repeat sequence in the 3' untranslated region of the protein kinase gene, DMPK. This defect results in the expression of mutant DMPK RNAs encoding expanded CUG repeats (CUGexp) that form large intra nuclear RNA-protein complexes or foci. Expression of CUGexp RNAs leads to abnormal RNA splicing, which in turn has been linked to the development of key features of DM1 pathology. We hypothesize that small molecules that degrade or disperse CUGexp RNAs in DM1 cells can re-establish normal splice patterns and reverse DM1 pathology. To test this hypothesis, we developed a primary HTS and a secondary hit validation assay to identify small-molecules that alter the biology of CUGexp RNAs without affecting the normal transcript. Our in house library was developed using a robust machine learning chemoinformatics platform and consists of 40,000 highly diverse small-molecules representing a library of over a million compounds. An initial screen of 2,500 small molecules from this library resulted in the identification of a potent lead compound, MDI16, which reverses aberrant RNA splice patterns in both DM1 patient myoblasts and in the HSALR mouse model for DM1. In a concerted effort to identify other potent lead compounds we propose the following: Aim 1. Implement primary HTS and the secondary hit validation assay in the MLPCN center. Aim 2. Test hits in tertiary cell-based assays to identify highly potent molecules that reverse four key cellular DM1 phenotypes. Aim 3. Characterize the selectivity and toxicity of lead compounds and identify their mechanism of action at the cellular level using a set of cell-based assays developed in the lab. Aim 4. In conjunction with the MLPCN center, we will refine the chemical structure of lead compounds reiteratively to optimize pharmacological properties and establish structure-activity relationships.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Lay Summary Myotonic dystrophy type 1 is a neuromuscular disorder for which there is no treatment or cure. Over the past few years exciting strides in our understanding of the mechanistic basis of this disorder have been made. Thus the field is poised to make a major breakthrough and develop a drug for this disorder. We have developed a sensitive high throughput screen (HTS) to identify compounds that cure or ameliorate pathologies associated with myotonic dystrophy. Currently we have discovered potent molecules, which rescue DM1 pathology in both DM1 patient myoblasts and in DM1 mouse models. As our screens have been proven to identify potent molecules that rescue DM1 pathology, in this application we propose to identify other lead compounds by screening the MLPCN chemical library with our HTS. Identification of multiple leads will greatly improve the probability of a small molecule therapy for DM1.           Lay Summary Myotonic dystrophy type 1 is a neuromuscular disorder for which there is no treatment or cure.

Thus the field is poised to make a major breakthrough and develop a drug for this disorder. We have developed a sensitive high throughput screen (HTS) to identify compounds that cure or ameliorate pathologies associated with myotonic dystrophy. Currently we have discovered potent molecules, which rescue DM1 pathology in both DM1 patient myoblasts and in DM1 mouse models. As our screens have been proven to identify potent molecules that rescue DM1 pathology, in this application we propose to identify other lead compounds by screening the MLPCN chemical library with our HTS. Identification of multiple leads will greatly improve the probability of a small molecule therapy for DM1.         ",High Throughput Screen for Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1,8209483,R03MH095544,"['Precursor Muscle Cells ', ' Embryonic Muscle Cells ', ' Myoblasts ', ' Ectopic Expression ', ' Chemical Structure ', ' Protein Family ', ' Steinert Disease ', ' Myotonia Dystrophica ', ' Myotonia Atrophica ', ' Dystrophia Myotonica ', ' Myotonic Dystrophy ', "" 3'UTR "", "" 3' Untranslated Regions "", ' neuromuscular disorder ', ' myoneural disorder ', ' Neuromuscular Diseases ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' muscle dystrophy ', ' Myodystrophy ', ' Myodystrophica ', ' Muscular Dystrophies ', ' chemical library ', ' small molecule libraries ', ' Gene Expression Inhibitor ', ' Antisense Agent ', ' Anti-Sense Oligonucleotides ', ' Antisense Oligonucleotides ', ' phosphorylase b kinase kinase ', ' hydroxyalkyl protein kinase ', ' glycogen synthase a kinase ', ' ATP-protein phosphotransferase ', ' Protein Kinase ', ' Series ', ' transcription factor ', ' Housing ', ' FDA approved ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Binding (Molecular Function) ', ' Link ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Property ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' therapeutic target ', ' improved ', ' Testing ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Cells ', ' Phenotype ', ' Affect ', ' mutant ', ' High Throughput Assay ', ' high throughput screening ', ' In Vitro ', ' Genes ', ' in vivo ', ' Patients ', ' Libraries ', ' base ', ' Defect ', ' Mediating ', ' Screening procedure ', ' Pattern ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Data ', ' small molecule ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA ', ' Molecular ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' mouse model ', ' Biology ', ' Validation ', ' Pathology ', ' Splicing ', ' RNA Splicing ', ' protein complex ', ' Probability ', ' Consult ', ' structure function relationship ', ' chemical structure function ', ' Structure-Activity Relationship ', ' Transcript ', ' Protein Kinase Calpha ', ' PKC(alpha) ', ' Protein Kinase C Alpha ', ' Nuclear RNA ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R03,2011,40750,CA-37,0.07868678507482423
"Biomarker discovery for mitochondrial toxicants using metabolic footprinting    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many environmental stressors have deleterious effects on mitochondrial functions, by a variety of mechanisms, and with timelines of different lengths. Mitochondrial dysfunction has multiple clinical presentations, often delayed from the onset of organelle damage. At present, biomarkers that report on mitochondrial function, to enable population studies of environmental exposures and their consequences, are lacking. This proposal seeks to identify candidate biomarkers using a metabolomics approach, in greater depth than has previously been applied to toxicologic investigations.  Metabolomic analysis provides a window on cellular and organismal functions, closer to the actual physiology than genomic or transcriptomic arrays. Using multiple platforms for separation and mass spectrometric resolution of complex mixtures, a comprehensive set of metabolites including organic acids, amino acids, steroids, complex lipids, energy charge and mitochondrial transport metabolites can be targeted. This technology will be employed to develop biomarkers of mitochondrial dysfunction that will fill an important gap in current studies of environmental toxicology.  Studies here will focus on a polybrominated diphenyl ether, BDE-47, that is emerging as one of the major persistent organic pollutants in the U.S. Published data from a collaborator, Dr. Kavanagh, and preliminary data indicate that BDE-47 impairs mitochondrial function in cell lines in vitro. Metabolites in extracellular media (metabolic footprinting) will be analyzed with primary mouse hepatocytes, one of the main targets of BDE-47 toxicity, as a function of dose and time of exposure. The hypothesis to be tested is that fatty acid overload will uncover subtle mitochondrial defects by performing metabolomic analysis in isolated mitochondria. These studies will provide metabolic signatures of BDE-47 toxicity that will next be extended to in vivo studies of plasma and urine from BDE-47 treated mice. The possibility that lymphocytes may be a surrogate tissue for the mitochondrial toxicities of BDE-47 will be examined using the fatty acid overload assay.  The effects of genetic background and environment on BDE-47 toxicity are poorly understood.  Two potential modifiers will be examined: 1) genetically engineered mice with low and high glutathione levels, and 2) fatty liver due to vitamin A deficiency. These experiments will provide novel information on potential high risk populations for BDE-47 exposure. A key question will be whether candidate biomarkers scale with toxicity (in addition to exposure dose).  In addition to discovering metabolic signatures of BDE-47 toxicity, two recently described mitochondrial responses to stress will be tested by metabolic footprinting: 1) mitochondrial proteotoxicity due to aggregation of unfolded/unassembled proteins, and 2) alternative fumarate respiration in response to hypoxia and distal block of the ETC. By selecting defined mitochondrial responses, one adverse and one adaptive, once can begin to categorize mitochondrial dysfunction and look for signatures that associate with specific types. In the case of fumarate respiration, a signature of high levels of succinate in secreted metabolites is already known.  This work is a close collaboration with Oliver Fiehn, expert in metabolomics screening and data analysis, and Terry Kavanagh, an expert in oxidative stress and mitochondrial toxicology.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Public Health Relevance/Project Narrative Many environmental toxins inhibit mitochondria, the powerhouses of the cell, as a mechanism of toxicity. Current research in this area is hampered by the lack of convenient tests to measure early mitochondrial damage, which would promote appropriate preventive/treatment efforts for individuals and at risk populations.

"Identification of Therapeutic Small Molecules for Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myotonic dystrophy (DM1) is the most common adult onset muscular dystrophy in humans. Currently, there is no cure or an FDA approved drug for DM1 and related diseases. DM1 is an autosomal dominant disorder resulting from the expansion of a CTG-repeat sequence in the 3' untranslated region of the DMPK gene. This defect results in the expression of mutant DMPK RNAs encoding expanded CUG repeats (CUGexp) that form large intra nuclear RNA-protein complexes or foci. Expression of CUGexp RNAs leads to abnormal RNA splicing, which in turn has been linked to the development of key features of DM1 pathology. We hypothesize that small molecules that degrade or disperse CUGexp RNAs in DM1 cells can re-establish normal splice patterns and reverse DM1 pathology. To test this hypothesis, we have developed a primary HTS and a secondary hit validation assay to identify small-molecules that selectively alter the biology of DMPK CUGexp RNAs without affecting the normal DMPK transcripts. Our in house library was developed using a robust machine learning chemoinformatics platform and consists of 40,000 highly diverse small-molecules representing a library of several million compounds. Preliminary results obtained from a screen of 2,500 compounds demonstrate that our strategy allows the rapid identification of potent molecules that successfully reverse DM1 pathology in both patient cells and DM1 mouse models. In a concerted effort to identify a set of potent lead compounds that can be developed as a therapeutic cocktail for DM1 we propose the following Aims: Aim 1. Implement primary HTS and the secondary hit validation assay to screen 20,000 molecules from our in-house library. Aim 2. Test hits in tertiary DM1 patient cell-based assays to identify highly potent leads that reverse five key cellular DM1 phenotypes. Selectivity, toxicity and synergy of leads will be measured in parallel. Aim 3. The chemical structure of lead compounds will be reiteratively refined to optimize pharmacological properties and establish structure-activity relationships.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We have developed a HTS screen to identify compounds that alter the biology of toxic CUGexp RNAs in myotonic dystrophy 1 (DM1).

"Engineering DNA Delivery Polymers using Combinatorial and Cheminformatics Methods    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the proposed research is to employ chemoenzymatic monomer synthesis, parallel polymer synthesis and cheminformatic modeling for the design and evaluation of polymers for transgene delivery. Gene-based strategies, designed to manipulate cellular phenotype by introducing exogenous genes, are attractive in therapeutic and functional genomics applications. Currently available non-viral (e.g. polymeric) gene delivery vectors are limited by toxicities and suffer from low efficacies. We hypothesize that a synergistic combination of rational chemoenzymatic synthesis of monomers and combinatorial polymer synthesis will lead to the rapid identification polymers with high efficacies for delivering genes to cells (Specific Aim 1). The rapid generation of transfection data will facilitate the construction of predictive Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) cheminformatic models that correlate gene delivery efficacy with polymer and polyplex physicochemical properties (e.g. molecular weight, hydrophobicity, zeta potential, etc.) using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Kernel-Partial Least Squares (K-PLS) regression (Specific Aim 2). A novel QSAR 'model- of models' approach will be developed in which, polymer physicochemical properties will first be estimated using predictive QSAR models based on monomer structure. QSAR models for transgene expression will then be generated using these estimated properties as a result of which, predictions of transgene expression efficacy will be based directly on monomer structures. In the long-term, such predictive QSAR models will aid in the rational design of high-efficacy polymeric transfection agents, which a powerful approach for non-viral gene delivery. Recognizing that polymer-mediated transgene expression suffers from low efficacies, we will employ a combination treatment approach using mediators of intracellular trafficking and transcription (chemotherapeutic enhancers), designed to enhance transgene expression in cells (Specific Aim 3). Finally, effective polymers along with chemotherapeutic enhancers will be employed for delivering genes that encode TRAIL, which selectively induces apoptosis in cancer cells, both in vitro and in vivo (Specific Aim 4). SCID mouse xenograft models will be employed to investigate recession of 22Rv1 prostate tumors, and biodistribution and toxicity of the polymer-plasmid complexes will be investigated. It is anticipated that the proposed research will result in the identification of (1) new effective polymers for non-viral gene delivery, (2) insights into polymer physicochemical factors that influence transgene delivery, (3) predictive QSAR models that will facilitate high-throughput 'in silico' identification of effective polymers, and (4) in vivo efficacy and biodistribution evaluation of polymer-based delivery. It is anticipated that this research will significantly impact gene-based therapeutics, functional genomics, and various applications that depend on high levels of transgene expression in cells. The proposed research will develop novel non-viral (polymeric) materials for gene delivery and evaluate them in vitro and in vivo. These will find significant application in gene therapy for a number of diseases and will expand therapeutic options in these cases.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This proposed research describes the engineering of novel polymers using combinatorial syntheses and cheminformatic modeling for enhanced transgene expression in cells.

"An automated high throughput phenotypic screen for schistosomiasis drug discovery    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schistosomiasis is a tropical parasitic disease infecting over 200 million people.

Traditional phenotypic screens, using adult- stage S. mansoni, are low-throughput and incompatible with modern high-throughput screen (HTS) systems.

"NOVEL PARADIGMS FOR DRUG DISCOVERY: COMPUTATIONAL MULTITARGET SCREENING    DESCRIPTION   Abstract:   We will create a comprehensive computational drug discovery platform by enhancing a novel technique for a dynamic, fragment based, screening of small molecule compounds against the three dimensional structures of multiple protein targets from infectious disease causing pathogens, followed by prospective in vitro and in vivo experimental verification. We will further modify the most promising lead candidates computationally and screen them against all known human proteins and variants simultaneously to assess for side effects against essential proteins, and to ensure that they possess safe and effective absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion profiles against major proteins in known drug delivery pathways. The top ranking leads will again be experimentally verified, and the computational protocol will be itera- tively refined using machine learning techniques. We will initially focus on discovering preclinical drug candidates against infections caused by all eight human herpes viruses (HHVs). This virus family infects billions of humans worldwide every year and is the source of significant mortality in immunocompromised patients. Broad spectrum therapeutics against these key pathogens will benefit the entire global community. In contrast to other computational efforts, my group has successfuly applied and experimentally verified their predictions of inhibitors to treat herpes, malaria, and dengue. This was accomplished at a fraction of the time, effort, and cost typically required by pharmaceutical companies. Our significant successes thus far attest to the efficacy of our drug discovery technologies.

"Cheminformatics of Allosteric mGluR Modulation promotes Therapeutic Development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Selective potentiators of the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype mGluR5 have exciting potential for development of novel treatment strategies for schizophrenia and other disorders that disrupt cognitive func-tion. The latest generation of selective mGluR5 potentiators is based on the lead compound CDPPB and features systemically active compounds with long half-lives that cross the blood-brain barrier. A high-throughput screen (HTS) for mGluR5 potentiators at Vanderbilt's screening center revealed a large and diverse set of about 1400 substances (1% hit rate) whose activity was validated in independent experiments.  A previous exploratory research grant ""Novel Schizophrenia Therapeutics by Virtual High-Throughput Screening"" (R21 MH082254) enabled testing of 813 compounds predicted through cheminformatics. 252 of these compounds were confirmed as active PAMs equaling an enrichment of >30 when compared with the original screen. The present proposal seeks to leverage these proof-of-principle results for the development of a tailored cheminformatics framework for drug discovery of allosteric modulators of brain GPCRs, apply these tools to inform an existing therapeutic discovery program of mGluR5 potentiators at Vanderbilt University, and disseminate the methods broadly through the NIH molecular libraries program.  The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the complex relationship between chemical structure and biological activity of mGluR5 potentiators observed in this HTS can be used to generate a pharmacophore of the mGluR5 allosteric site. This map of steric and electronic features necessary for optimal interaction of modulators with mGluR5 will not only inform our understanding of the allosteric modulation of brain GPCRs. The methods proposed overcome limitations of present cheminformatics techniques by enabling identification of novel chemotypes through virtual screening (scaffold hoping), and allowing design of focused libraries in hit-to- lead optimization of novel schizophrenia therapeutics.  The generalizbility of the approach will be tested through application on negative modulators of mGluR5, a potential novel treatment strategy of fragile X syndrome, a CNS disorder associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) among multiple other symptoms. The developed applications will be made freely and readily accessible for academic research. The employed QSAR models require no crystal structure of the target brain GPCR. Hence the method can be readily applied to membrane proteins-such as GPCRs-which are target of 40-50% of modern medicinal drugs.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Ligands for specific mGluR subtypes have potential for treatment of a wide variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders. We will use computational methods identify potentiators of mGluR5, compounds that have exciting potential as treatment strategy for schizophrenia.

"Identification of novel therapeutics for tuberculosis combining cheminformatics,     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We are witnessing the growing menace of both increasing cases of drug-sensitive and drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) strains and the challenge to produce the first new tuberculosis (TB) drug in well over 40 years. The TB community, having invested in extensive high-throughput screening efforts, is faced with the question of how to optimally leverage this data in order to move from a hit to a lead to a clinical candidate and potentially a new drug. Complementing this approach, yet conducted on a much smaller scale, cheminformatic techniques have been leveraged. We suggest these computational approaches should be more optimally integrated in a workflow with experimental approaches to accelerate TB drug discovery. This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase II project entitled ""Identification of novel therapeutics for tuberculosis combining cheminformatics, diverse databases and logic-based pathway analysis"" describes the development of software that will facilitate new drug discovery efforts for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) and the progression of molecules discovered with it as mimics for substrates of enzymes and their in vivo essential genes. In phase 1 we illustrated the concept of loosely marrying the cheminformatic and pathways database that resulted in two compounds as proposed mimics of 2 D-fructose 1,6 bisphosphate with activity against Mtb (MIC 20 and 40mg/ml). In phase II via an API we will link the knowledge in CDD, SRI and other databases and tools seamlessly. A researcher will be able to investigate molecules, targets, pathways and then select metabolites or other molecules for pharmacophore analysis, scoring with TB machine learning models and ADME and drug-likeness assessment from within one interface. This tool will be used to aid the identification of novel therapeutics for tuberculosis and be useful for hypotheses testing, knowledge sharing, data archiving, data mining and drug discovery. We will make CDD into a mobile application such that the generalized workflow in this project can be performed anywhere. We present promising preliminary work which resulted in two active compounds, that suggests phase II support of the mimic strategy to identify compounds of interest for TB would be a viable strategy. This proposal balances software development, database development and drug discovery activities in order to achieve our goals. We expect this product could be quickly applied to other infectious diseases which have a great societal impact and as a stretch goal we will endeavor to demonstrate this.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to develop an integrated system to facilitate new drug discovery efforts for TB using novel logical inference techniques developed by scientists at SRI International, linked with knowledge which has been assembled by the curation of diverse biological data types and computational prediction by Collaborative Drug Discovery (CDD). This tool will be used to aid the identification of novel therapeutics for tuberculosis by combining cheminformatics, diverse databases and logic-based pathway analysis.

"Identification of Therapeutic Small Molecules for Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myotonic dystrophy (DM1) is the most common adult onset muscular dystrophy in humans. Currently, there is no cure or an FDA approved drug for DM1 and related diseases. DM1 is an autosomal dominant disorder resulting from the expansion of a CTG-repeat sequence in the 3' untranslated region of the DMPK gene. This defect results in the expression of mutant DMPK RNAs encoding expanded CUG repeats (CUGexp) that form large intra nuclear RNA-protein complexes or foci. Expression of CUGexp RNAs leads to abnormal RNA splicing, which in turn has been linked to the development of key features of DM1 pathology. We hypothesize that small molecules that degrade or disperse CUGexp RNAs in DM1 cells can re-establish normal splice patterns and reverse DM1 pathology. To test this hypothesis, we have developed a primary HTS and a secondary hit validation assay to identify small-molecules that selectively alter the biology of DMPK CUGexp RNAs without affecting the normal DMPK transcripts. Our in house library was developed using a robust machine learning chemoinformatics platform and consists of 40,000 highly diverse small-molecules representing a library of several million compounds. Preliminary results obtained from a screen of 2,500 compounds demonstrate that our strategy allows the rapid identification of potent molecules that successfully reverse DM1 pathology in both patient cells and DM1 mouse models. In a concerted effort to identify a set of potent lead compounds that can be developed as a therapeutic cocktail for DM1 we propose the following Aims: Aim 1. Implement primary HTS and the secondary hit validation assay to screen 20,000 molecules from our in-house library. Aim 2. Test hits in tertiary DM1 patient cell-based assays to identify highly potent leads that reverse five key cellular DM1 phenotypes. Selectivity, toxicity and synergy of leads will be measured in parallel. Aim 3. The chemical structure of lead compounds will be reiteratively refined to optimize pharmacological properties and establish structure-activity relationships.          We have developed a HTS screen to identify compounds that alter the biology of toxic CUGexp RNAs in myotonic dystrophy 1 (DM1). This screen will be used to identify therapeutic compounds that can be used to treat DM1.

"Discovery of A-beta Oligomer Antagonists via 3D Pharmacophore Space Analysis The goal of this proposal is to discover drug-like retinoid X receptor (RXR) agonists that can halt and reverse the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The research strategy is to target ApoE gene expression through RXR agonists; this has recently been shown to improve A¿ turnover, reduction in A¿ plaque area, and the reversal of cognitive, social and olfactory deficits. The research plan consists of two steps. The first step is computer-aided prediction of agonistic RXR binding, blood brain barrier permeability, and absence of side effects. This step relies on a novel method for pharmacophore analysis by examining the joint space of chemical compounds, targets, and chemical/biological properties. This joint space is defined using machine learning on the 3D geometry of spatial arrangement of pharmacophoric points, using attributes such as donors, acceptors, aromatic rings, and charged fragments. The second step consists of biochemical assays including competitive binding with bexarotene, and ApoE level determination in cultured mouse brain cells. A small number of drug-like compounds will be obtained through multiple iterations of the two steps of in-silico prediction and assays at the end of Phase 1. The outcome of this study will be new drug leads to potentially treat and prevent AD at different stages of cognitive decline and neurodegeneration. Interleaving of computer-aided screening of large chemical databases through novel machine learning based models with biochemical assays will identify drug-like compounds that can clear toxic chemicals responsible for Alzheimer's Disease from brain cells with minimal side-effects.

"Identification of Biomarkers of Cardiotoxicity using Metabolomics of Human Plurip    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiotoxicity, as a result of adverse drug effects, is a serious problem that has yet to be effectively screened prior to patient exposure. Cardiac safety is one of the leading causes of compound attrition in the pharmaceutical industry and withdrawal of FDA-approved drugs from the market. The purpose of this proposal is to alleviate the financial burden of compound attrition due to cardiotoxicity, but more importantly, to improve public health through the development of an in vitro assay to predict a drug's ability to induce cardiotoxicity. Stemina Biomarker Discovery (""Stemina"") proposes to do so through the use of metabolomics on treated cardiomyocytes derived from human embryonic stem (hES) and human induced pluripotent stem (hiPS) cells. These technologies will be used to discover human endogenous small molecule biomarkers which predict cardiotoxicity, with an emphasis on cardiomyopathy. The use of metabolomics to measure small molecules secreted by human cardiomyocytes in response to drugs is a novel approach and may pave the way for a new generation of more accurate predictive toxicology screens. Stemina has already used such a paradigm to develop predictive methods to assess development toxicology in stem cells. Stemina's long-term goal is to fully develop this humanized, high throughput cardiotoxicity screen so that it would be a valuable tool to pharmaceutical and biotech companies during preclinical development of therapeutics. In order to achieve this long term goal, Stemina is first proposing to establish an experimental platform for each cardiomyocyte culture system (Aim 1). In Aim 2, we will use these systems to develop a dose response curve for each of the 24 compounds (16 cardiotoxic and 10 non-cardiotoxic) as a training set to establish a predictive metabolomic model. These dose response curves will be used to determine 3 concentrations for drug treatment to be utilized in Aim 3. Stemina will then establish a specific metabolic signature of candidate human biomarkers of drug-induced cardiotoxicity (Aim 3). To do so, human pluripotent stem (hPS) cell-derived cardiomyocytes will be treated with well-established known inducers and non-inducers of cardiotoxiciy. The spent medium from treated cells will be analyzed with mass spectrometry in order to study the secreted metabolites, or secretome, of these cells. Small molecules whose abundances vary dependent upon whether cells were treated with an inducer or non-inducer of cardiotoxicity will serve as candidate biomarkers of cardiotoxicity. In future studies, these candidate biomarkers will be validated through the use of specialized mass spectrometry techniques. Lastly, the ability of these biomarkers to adequately predict cardiotoxicity will be tested through the use of a blind study. Completion of these aims will encourage further discussions with partnering companies in order to develop a kit that can detect the validated biomarkers of cardiotoxicity. Stemina will then utilize this kit to market a service to predict whether or not a compound will induce cardiotoxicity that will serve pharmaceutical companies in pre-clinical screening trials.

"Engineering DNA Delivery Polymers using Combinatorial and Cheminformatics Methods    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the proposed research is to employ chemoenzymatic monomer synthesis, parallel polymer synthesis and cheminformatic modeling for the design and evaluation of polymers for transgene delivery. Gene-based strategies, designed to manipulate cellular phenotype by introducing exogenous genes, are attractive in therapeutic and functional genomics applications. Currently available non-viral (e.g. polymeric) gene delivery vectors are limited by toxicities and suffer from low efficacies. We hypothesize that a synergistic combination of rational chemoenzymatic synthesis of monomers and combinatorial polymer synthesis will lead to the rapid identification polymers with high efficacies for delivering genes to cells (Specific Aim 1). The rapid generation of transfection data will facilitate the construction of predictive Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) cheminformatic models that correlate gene delivery efficacy with polymer and polyplex physicochemical properties (e.g. molecular weight, hydrophobicity, zeta potential, etc.) using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Kernel-Partial Least Squares (K-PLS) regression (Specific Aim 2). A novel QSAR 'model- of models' approach will be developed in which, polymer physicochemical properties will first be estimated using predictive QSAR models based on monomer structure. QSAR models for transgene expression will then be generated using these estimated properties as a result of which, predictions of transgene expression efficacy will be based directly on monomer structures. In the long-term, such predictive QSAR models will aid in the rational design of high-efficacy polymeric transfection agents, which a powerful approach for non-viral gene delivery. Recognizing that polymer-mediated transgene expression suffers from low efficacies, we will employ a combination treatment approach using mediators of intracellular trafficking and transcription (chemotherapeutic enhancers), designed to enhance transgene expression in cells (Specific Aim 3). Finally, effective polymers along with chemotherapeutic enhancers will be employed for delivering genes that encode TRAIL, which selectively induces apoptosis in cancer cells, both in vitro and in vivo (Specific Aim 4). SCID mouse xenograft models will be employed to investigate recession of 22Rv1 prostate tumors, and biodistribution and toxicity of the polymer-plasmid complexes will be investigated. It is anticipated that the proposed research will result in the identification of (1) new effective polymers for non-viral gene delivery, (2) insights into polymer physicochemical factors that influence transgene delivery, (3) predictive QSAR models that will facilitate high-throughput 'in silico' identification of effective polymers, and (4) in vivo efficacy and biodistribution evaluation of polymer-based delivery. It is anticipated that this research will significantly impact gene-based therapeutics, functional genomics, and various applications that depend on high levels of transgene expression in cells. The proposed research will develop novel non-viral (polymeric) materials for gene delivery and evaluate them in vitro and in vivo. These will find significant application in gene therapy for a number of diseases and will expand therapeutic options in these cases.

"Predictive Smoking Cessation Preclinical Battery     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite great advances in both the understanding of the neurobiology of addiction and the development and approval of smoking cessation therapies, a significant need remains for better smoking cessation aids. Our goal is aligned with NIDA's intent to bring the power of science to bear on drug abuse and addiction. We propose to use tools from a broad range of disciplines, and promise rapid and effective dissemination and use of the results of the proposed research to significantly improve treatment of nicotine abuse and addiction. The platform we propose to use will help identify, evaluate, and develop innovative medications to treat nicotine abuse and addiction. We propose to implement a research program through collaborations with academia, industry and government. Although there are two first-line (varenicline and bupropion) and two second-line (clonidine and notriptyline) approved medications for smoking cessation that significantly help to stop smoking, about 80% of smokers are unable to remain abstinent. As an explanation for such low success rate, it has been hypothesized that addiction develops in the presence of predisposing cognitive and affective states, which are unaffected by existing therapeutics but could be targeted by new smoking cessation aids for improved efficacy. One of the main reasons for the slow development of novel medications with improved efficacy is the lack of clearly translatable preclinical models of nicotine dependence that exhibit high degrees of predictive validity. Most preclinical tests are simply based on blocking nicotine-like effects but ignore other predisposing or underlying factors, either cognitive or emotional, that may trigger and maintain nicotine abuse. The availability of both approved medications and failed compounds gives us the opportunity to create a battery of nicotine dependence and CNS efficacy tests with enhanced predictive validity, potentially a key tool in enhancing future discovery and development efforts. During Phase I we will develop a test battery based on 1) consideration of multiple aspects underlying abuse (rewarding effects of acute and chronic nicotine, alleviation of withdrawal, relapse, anxiety, depression, cognitive dysfunction and impulsivity), 2) definition of a smoking cessation predictive score through a machine learning algorithm trained on a behavioral dataset generated with both effective and ineffective medications in our test battery and 3) minimization of animal and throughput costs. During Phase II the platform will grow to comprise a database of compounds and mechanisms of action of postulated smoking cessation potential, prioritized by their smoking cessation scores and predicted superiority in combating emotional and cognitive aspects of nicotine dependence. Finally, this platform (battery, database and computational tools) will be offered during Phase III as drug screening method to the members of a private public partnership, created to maintain, support, further develop and publicize the platform. The novelty of this project resides in the combination of economic principles and bioinformatics methods to take advantage of existing smoking cessation FDA-approved gold standards, the inclusion of cognitive and emotional state-relevant testing in the proposed preclinical battery, the creation of a knowledge database, and the management of the final platform by a private-public consortium to ensure maximal quality, value and access. We expect that the knowledge and tools generate by this project will stimulate further research and drug development both for smoking cessation and across other areas of drug abuse and discovery.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Predictive Smoking Cessation Preclinical Battery Despite great advances in both the understanding of the neurobiology of addiction and the development and approval of smoking cessation therapies, a significant need remains for better smoking cessation aids.

We will use novel statistical and computational tools to determine which subset of faster and cheaper tests is necessary to distinguish these two classes to create an optimized predictive test battery. We will then characterize a series of compounds that are thought to be promising candidates for future anti- smoking medications using the novel screening battery. Using bioinformatics methods we will compare these promising compounds against the set of efficacious FDA-approved compounds and assign them a predictive score that represents the likelihood that such compounds will be effective in the clinic. We will further prioritize compounds that show additional positive features such as pro-cognitive or anxiolytic effects.

"Human iPS/ES Cell-Based Models for Predictive Neural Toxicity and Teratogenicity     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal brings together leading experts in human pluripotent stem cell biology (Thomson), tissue engineering (Murphy), and machine learning (Page) to develop improved human cellular models for predicting developmental neural toxicity. Dramatic progress has been made in the derivation of many of the basic cellular components of the brain from human pluripotent stem cells (ES and iPS cells), but these advances have yet to be applied to predictive toxicology. The major components of the brain are derived from diverse embryological origins, including the neural plate (neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes), yolk sac myeloid progenitors (microglia), migratory mesodermal angioblasts (endothelial cells), and neural crest (vascular smooth muscle and pericytes). Because of their diverse origins, these components have very different inductive signaling histories. This means that deriving them all at once under the same conditions is not currently possible. For this reason, we will differentiate human pluripotent stem cells to early precursors of the major neural, glial, and vascular components of the cerebral cortex separately, cryopreserve the precursors, and subsequently combine them in 3D hydrogel assemblies to allow increased physiological interactions and maturation. Specifically, we will embed committed precursors for endothelial cells, pericytes, and microglia into hydrogels displaying combinations of peptide motifs that promote capillary network formation. We will then overlay this mesenchymal layer with neural and glial precursors to mimic the normal interactions between the cephalic mesenchyme and the neural epithelium, and promote the formation of the polarized layers of the cerebral cortex. After drug exposure, we will assess temporal changes in gene expression by these cerebral neural- vascular assemblies using highly multiplexed, deep RNA sequencing. Then, using safe drugs and known neural/developmental toxins from the NIH Clinical Collection, the University of Washington Teratogen Information System Database, and the EPA's Toxicity Reference Database as training sets, we will develop machine learning algorithms to predict neural toxicity of blinded drugs known to have failed in late stage animal testing or human clinical trials. This predictive, developmental neural toxicity model will be implemented on liquid handling robots and sequencers in widespread use, and will be readily adaptable to platforms being developed in complementary efforts by DARPA. The developmental potential of human pluripotent stem cells, the modular nature of the tunable hydrogels, and the discriminatory power of machine learning tools also makes the general approaches proposed readily applicable to predictive toxicity models for other tissue types throughout the body.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop three-dimensional constructs of human neural tissue to better predict the neural toxicity of drugs prior to clinical trials. To accomplish this, experts in human pluripotent stem cell biology will grow the required neural components in the laboratory, experts in tissue engineers will assemble those cells into multicellular constructs, and experts in machine learning will use changes in gene expression after drug exposure to predict whether a test compound is toxic.              This project will develop three-dimensional constructs of human neural tissue to better predict the neural toxicity of drugs prior to clinical trials.

"Biomarker discovery for mitochondrial toxicants using metabolic footprinting  Abstract Many environmental stressors have deleterious effects on mitochondrial functions, by a variety of mechanisms, and with timelines of different lengths. Mitochondrial dysfunction has multiple clinical presentations, often delayed from the onset of organelle damage. At present, biomarkers that report on mitochondrial function, to enable population studies of environmental exposures and their consequences, are lacking. We propose to identify candidate biomarkers using a metabolomics approach, in greater depth than has previously been applied to toxicologic investigations.  Metabolomic analysis provides a window on cellular and organismal functions, closer to the actual physiology than genomic or transcriptomic arrays. Using multiple platforms for separation and mass spectrometric resolution of complex mixtures, a comprehensive set of metabolites including organic acids, amino acids, steroids, complex lipids, energy charge and mitochondrial transport metabolites can be targeted. We will use this technology to develop biomarkers of mitochondrial dysfunction that will fill an important gap in current studies of environmental toxicology.  We will focus our studies on a polybrominated diphenyl ether, BDE-47, that is emerging as one of the major persistent organic pollutants in the U.S. Published data from our collaborator, Dr. Kavanagh, and our preliminary data indicate that BDE-47 impairs mitochondrial function in cell lines in vitro. Metabolites in extracellular media (metabolic footprinting) will be analyzed with primary mouse hepatocytes, one of the main targets of BDE-47 toxicity, as a function of dose and time of exposure. We will also test the hypothesis that fatty acid overload will uncover subtle mitochondrial defects by performing metabolomic analysis in isolated mitochondria. These studies will provide metabolic signatures of BDE-47 toxicity that will next be extended to in vivo studies of plasma and urine from BDE-47 treated mice. The possibility that lymphocytes may be a surrogate tissue for the mitochondrial toxicities of BDE-47 will be examined using the fatty acid overload assay.  The effects of genetic background and environment on BDE-47 toxicity are poorly understood. We will test two potential modifiers: 1) genetically engineered mice with low and high glutathione levels, and 2) fatty liver due to vitamin A deficiency. These experiments will provide novel information on potential high risk populations for BDE-47 exposure. A key question for these studies will be whether candidate biomarkers scale with toxicity (in addition to exposure dose).  In addition to discovering metabolic signatures of BDE-47 toxicity, we will examine two recently described mitochondrial responses to stress by metabolic footprinting: 1) mitochondrial proteotoxicity due to aggregation of unfolded/unassembled proteins, and 2) alternative fumarate respiration in response to hypoxia and distal block of the electron transport chain. By selecting defined mitochondrial responses, one adverse and one adaptive, we begin to categorize mitochondrial dysfunction and look for signatures that associate with specific types. In the case of fumarate respiration, a signature of high levels of succinate in secreted metabolites is already known.  This work is a close collaboration with Oliver Fiehn, expert in metabolomics screening and data analysis, and Terry Kavanagh, an expert in oxidative stress and mitochondrial toxicology.

"NOVEL PARADIGMS FOR DRUG DISCOVERY: COMPUTATIONAL MULTITARGET SCREENING    DESCRIPTION   Abstract:   We will create a comprehensive computational drug discovery platform by enhancing a novel technique for a dynamic, fragment based, screening of small molecule compounds against the three dimensional structures of multiple protein targets from infectious disease causing pathogens, followed by prospective in vitro and in vivo experimental verification. We will further modify the most promising lead candidates computationally and screen them against all known human proteins and variants simultaneously to assess for side effects against essential proteins, and to ensure that they possess safe and effective absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion profiles against major proteins in known drug delivery pathways. The top ranking leads will again be experimentally verified, and the computational protocol will be itera- tively refined using machine learning techniques. We will initially focus on discovering preclinical drug candidates against infections caused by all eight human herpes viruses (HHVs). This virus family infects billions of humans worldwide every year and is the source of significant mortality in immunocompromised patients. Broad spectrum therapeutics against these key pathogens will benefit the entire global community. In contrast to other computational efforts, my group has successfuly applied and experimentally verified their predictions of inhibitors to treat herpes, malaria, and dengue. This was accomplished at a fraction of the time, effort, and cost typically required by pharmaceutical companies. Our significant successes thus far attest to the efficacy of our drug discovery technologies. The Pioneer Award funds will therefore allow us to bridge the gap of discovering computationally predicted lead compounds and demonstrating their preclinical effectiveness for further clinical and therapeutic use.

"Cheminformatics of Allosteric mGluR Modulation promotes Therapeutic Development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Selective potentiators of the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype mGluR5 have exciting potential for development of novel treatment strategies for schizophrenia and other disorders that disrupt cognitive func-tion. The latest generation of selective mGluR5 potentiators is based on the lead compound CDPPB and features systemically active compounds with long half-lives that cross the blood-brain barrier. A high-throughput screen (HTS) for mGluR5 potentiators at Vanderbilt's screening center revealed a large and diverse set of about 1400 substances (1% hit rate) whose activity was validated in independent experiments.  A previous exploratory research grant ""Novel Schizophrenia Therapeutics by Virtual High-Throughput Screening"" (R21 MH082254) enabled testing of 813 compounds predicted through cheminformatics. 252 of these compounds were confirmed as active PAMs equaling an enrichment of >30 when compared with the original screen. The present proposal seeks to leverage these proof-of-principle results for the development of a tailored cheminformatics framework for drug discovery of allosteric modulators of brain GPCRs, apply these tools to inform an existing therapeutic discovery program of mGluR5 potentiators at Vanderbilt University, and disseminate the methods broadly through the NIH molecular libraries program.  The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the complex relationship between chemical structure and biological activity of mGluR5 potentiators observed in this HTS can be used to generate a pharmacophore of the mGluR5 allosteric site. This map of steric and electronic features necessary for optimal interaction of modulators with mGluR5 will not only inform our understanding of the allosteric modulation of brain GPCRs. The methods proposed overcome limitations of present cheminformatics techniques by enabling identification of novel chemotypes through virtual screening (scaffold hoping), and allowing design of focused libraries in hit-to- lead optimization of novel schizophrenia therapeutics.  The generalizbility of the approach will be tested through application on negative modulators of mGluR5, a potential novel treatment strategy of fragile X syndrome, a CNS disorder associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) among multiple other symptoms. The developed applications will be made freely and readily accessible for academic research. The employed QSAR models require no crystal structure of the target brain GPCR. Hence the method can be readily applied to membrane proteins-such as GPCRs-which are target of 40-50% of modern medicinal drugs.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Ligands for specific mGluR subtypes have potential for treatment of a wide variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders. We will use computational methods identify potentiators of mGluR5, compounds that have exciting potential as treatment strategy for schizophrenia. In silico hit compounds will be experimentally validated and enter hit-to-lead optimization.

"Biomarker discovery for mitochondrial toxicants using metabolic footprinting  Abstract Many environmental stressors have deleterious effects on mitochondrial functions, by a variety of mechanisms, and with timelines of different lengths. Mitochondrial dysfunction has multiple clinical presentations, often delayed from the onset of organelle damage. At present, biomarkers that report on mitochondrial function, to enable population studies of environmental exposures and their consequences, are lacking. We propose to identify candidate biomarkers using a metabolomics approach, in greater depth than has previously been applied to toxicologic investigations.  Metabolomic analysis provides a window on cellular and organismal functions, closer to the actual physiology than genomic or transcriptomic arrays. Using multiple platforms for separation and mass spectrometric resolution of complex mixtures, a comprehensive set of metabolites including organic acids, amino acids, steroids, complex lipids, energy charge and mitochondrial transport metabolites can be targeted. We will use this technology to develop biomarkers of mitochondrial dysfunction that will fill an important gap in current studies of environmental toxicology.  We will focus our studies on a polybrominated diphenyl ether, BDE-47, that is emerging as one of the major persistent organic pollutants in the U.S. Published data from our collaborator, Dr. Kavanagh, and our preliminary data indicate that BDE-47 impairs mitochondrial function in cell lines in vitro. Metabolites in extracellular media (metabolic footprinting) will be analyzed with primary mouse hepatocytes, one of the main targets of BDE-47 toxicity, as a function of dose and time of exposure. We will also test the hypothesis that fatty acid overload will uncover subtle mitochondrial defects by performing metabolomic analysis in isolated mitochondria. These studies will provide metabolic signatures of BDE-47 toxicity that will next be extended to in vivo studies of plasma and urine from BDE-47 treated mice. The possibility that lymphocytes may be a surrogate tissue for the mitochondrial toxicities of BDE-47 will be examined using the fatty acid overload assay.  The effects of genetic background and environment on BDE-47 toxicity are poorly understood. We will test two potential modifiers: 1) genetically engineered mice with low and high glutathione levels, and 2) fatty liver due to vitamin A deficiency. These experiments will provide novel information on potential high risk populations for BDE-47 exposure. A key question for these studies will be whether candidate biomarkers scale with toxicity (in addition to exposure dose).  In addition to discovering metabolic signatures of BDE-47 toxicity, we will examine two recently described mitochondrial responses to stress by metabolic footprinting: 1) mitochondrial proteotoxicity due to aggregation of unfolded/unassembled proteins, and 2) alternative fumarate respiration in response to hypoxia and distal block of the electron transport chain. By selecting defined mitochondrial responses, one adverse and one adaptive, we begin to categorize mitochondrial dysfunction and look for signatures that associate with specific types. In the case of fumarate respiration, a signature of high levels of succinate in secreted metabolites is already known.  This work is a close collaboration with Oliver Fiehn, expert in metabolomics screening and data analysis, and Terry Kavanagh, an expert in oxidative stress and mitochondrial toxicology.

"Identification of Therapeutic Small Molecules for Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myotonic dystrophy (DM1) is the most common adult onset muscular dystrophy in humans. Currently, there is no cure or an FDA approved drug for DM1 and related diseases. DM1 is an autosomal dominant disorder resulting from the expansion of a CTG-repeat sequence in the 3' untranslated region of the DMPK gene. This defect results in the expression of mutant DMPK RNAs encoding expanded CUG repeats (CUGexp) that form large intra nuclear RNA-protein complexes or foci. Expression of CUGexp RNAs leads to abnormal RNA splicing, which in turn has been linked to the development of key features of DM1 pathology. We hypothesize that small molecules that degrade or disperse CUGexp RNAs in DM1 cells can re-establish normal splice patterns and reverse DM1 pathology. To test this hypothesis, we have developed a primary HTS and a secondary hit validation assay to identify small-molecules that selectively alter the biology of DMPK CUGexp RNAs without affecting the normal DMPK transcripts. Our in house library was developed using a robust machine learning chemoinformatics platform and consists of 40,000 highly diverse small-molecules representing a library of several million compounds. Preliminary results obtained from a screen of 2,500 compounds demonstrate that our strategy allows the rapid identification of potent molecules that successfully reverse DM1 pathology in both patient cells and DM1 mouse models. In a concerted effort to identify a set of potent lead compounds that can be developed as a therapeutic cocktail for DM1 we propose the following Aims: Aim 1. Implement primary HTS and the secondary hit validation assay to screen 20,000 molecules from our in-house library. Aim 2. Test hits in tertiary DM1 patient cell-based assays to identify highly potent leads that reverse five key cellular DM1 phenotypes. Selectivity, toxicity and synergy of leads will be measured in parallel. Aim 3. The chemical structure of lead compounds will be reiteratively refined to optimize pharmacological properties and establish structure-activity relationships.          We have developed a HTS screen to identify compounds that alter the biology of toxic CUGexp RNAs in myotonic dystrophy 1 (DM1). This screen will be used to identify therapeutic compounds that can be used to treat DM1.

We will further modify the most promising lead candidates computationally and screen them against all known human proteins and variants simultaneously to assess for side effects against essential proteins, and to ensure that they possess safe and effective absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion profiles against major proteins in known drug delivery pathways. The top ranking leads will again be experimentally verified, and the computational protocol will be itera- tively refined using machine learning techniques. We will initially focus on discovering preclinical drug candidates against infections caused by all eight human herpes viruses (HHVs). This virus family infects billions of humans worldwide every year and is the source of significant mortality in immunocompromised patients. Broad spectrum therapeutics against these key pathogens will benefit the entire global community. In contrast to other computational efforts, my group has successfuly applied and experimentally verified their predictions of inhibitors to treat herpes, malaria, and dengue. This was accomplished at a fraction of the time, effort, and cost typically required by pharmaceutical companies. Our significant successes thus far attest to the efficacy of our drug discovery technologies. The Pioneer Award funds will therefore allow us to bridge the gap of discovering computationally predicted lead compounds and demonstrating their preclinical effectiveness for further clinical and therapeutic use. The ultimate goal is to create a comprehensive computational drug discovery pipeline, applicable to any disease, thereby increasing the suc       ",NOVEL PARADIGMS FOR DRUG DISCOVERY: COMPUTATIONAL MULTITARGET SCREENING,8509784,DP1LM011509,"['absorption ', ' abstracting ', ' inhibitor ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' Award ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases and Manifestations ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Communities ', ' breakbone fever ', ' Dengue Fever ', ' Dengue ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' herpes virus ', ' Herpesviruses ', ' Herpesviridae ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' In Vitro ', ' Infection ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Plasmodium Infections ', ' Paludism ', ' Malaria ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolism ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' gene product ', ' Proteins ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' General Viruses ', ' Virus ', ' Drug Delivery ', ' Drug Delivery Systems ', ' immunosuppressed patient ', ' Immunosuppressed Host ', ' Immunocompromised Patient ', ' Immunocompromised ', ' Immunocompromised Host ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Ensure ', ' excretion ', ' Excretory function ', ' Funding ', ' Therapeutic ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' success ', ' novel ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Adverse effects ', ' drug discovery ', ' Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' Therapeutic Uses ', ' Effectiveness ', ' small molecule ', ' in vivo ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' cost ', ' 3D structure ', ' 3-dimensional structure ', ' 3-D structure ', ' three dimensional structure ', ' pathogen ', ' prospective ', ' drug candidate ', ' screening ', ' ']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,DP1,2013,797049,WA-07,0.06975187948696297
"Human iPS/ES Cell-Based Models for Predictive Neural Toxicity and Teratogenicity     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal brings together leading experts in human pluripotent stem cell biology (Thomson), tissue engineering (Murphy), and machine learning (Page) to develop improved human cellular models for predicting developmental neural toxicity. Dramatic progress has been made in the derivation of many of the basic cellular components of the brain from human pluripotent stem cells (ES and iPS cells), but these advances have yet to be applied to predictive toxicology. The major components of the brain are derived from diverse embryological origins, including the neural plate (neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes), yolk sac myeloid progenitors (microglia), migratory mesodermal angioblasts (endothelial cells), and neural crest (vascular smooth muscle and pericytes). Because of their diverse origins, these components have very different inductive signaling histories. This means that deriving them all at once under the same conditions is not currently possible. For this reason, we will differentiate human pluripotent stem cells to early precursors of the major neural, glial, and vascular components of the cerebral cortex separately, cryopreserve the precursors, and subsequently combine them in 3D hydrogel assemblies to allow increased physiological interactions and maturation. Specifically, we will embed committed precursors for endothelial cells, pericytes, and microglia into hydrogels displaying combinations of peptide motifs that promote capillary network formation. We will then overlay this mesenchymal layer with neural and glial precursors to mimic the normal interactions between the cephalic mesenchyme and the neural epithelium, and promote the formation of the polarized layers of the cerebral cortex. After drug exposure, we will assess temporal changes in gene expression by these cerebral neural- vascular assemblies using highly multiplexed, deep RNA sequencing. Then, using safe drugs and known neural/developmental toxins from the NIH Clinical Collection, the University of Washington Teratogen Information System Database, and the EPA's Toxicity Reference Database as training sets, we will develop machine learning algorithms to predict neural toxicity of blinded drugs known to have failed in late stage animal testing or human clinical trials. This predictive, developmental neural toxicity model will be implemented on liquid handling robots and sequencers in widespread use, and will be readily adaptable to platforms being developed in complementary efforts by DARPA. The developmental potential of human pluripotent stem cells, the modular nature of the tunable hydrogels, and the discriminatory power of machine learning tools also makes the general approaches proposed readily applicable to predictive toxicity models for other tissue types throughout the body.          This project will develop three-dimensional constructs of human neural tissue to better predict the neural toxicity of drugs prior to clinical trials. To accomplish this, experts in human pluripotent stem cell biology will grow the required neural components in the laboratory, experts in tissue engineers will assemble those cells into multicellular constructs, and experts in machine learning will use changes in gene expression after drug exposure to predict whether a test compound is toxic.

"Identification of novel therapeutics for tuberculosis combining cheminformatics,     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We are witnessing the growing menace of both increasing cases of drug-sensitive and drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) strains and the challenge to produce the first new tuberculosis (TB) drug in well over 40 years. The TB community, having invested in extensive high-throughput screening efforts, is faced with the question of how to optimally leverage this data in order to move from a hit to a lead to a clinical candidate and potentially a new drug. Complementing this approach, yet conducted on a much smaller scale, cheminformatic techniques have been leveraged. We suggest these computational approaches should be more optimally integrated in a workflow with experimental approaches to accelerate TB drug discovery. This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase II project entitled ""Identification of novel therapeutics for tuberculosis combining cheminformatics, diverse databases and logic-based pathway analysis"" describes the development of software that will facilitate new drug discovery efforts for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) and the progression of molecules discovered with it as mimics for substrates of enzymes and their in vivo essential genes. In phase 1 we illustrated the concept of loosely marrying the cheminformatic and pathways database that resulted in two compounds as proposed mimics of 2 D-fructose 1,6 bisphosphate with activity against Mtb (MIC 20 and 40mg/ml). In phase II via an API we will link the knowledge in CDD, SRI and other databases and tools seamlessly. A researcher will be able to investigate molecules, targets, pathways and then select metabolites or other molecules for pharmacophore analysis, scoring with TB machine learning models and ADME and drug-likeness assessment from within one interface. This tool will be used to aid the identification of novel therapeutics for tuberculosis and be useful for hypotheses testing, knowledge sharing, data archiving, data mining and drug discovery. We will make CDD into a mobile application such that the generalized workflow in this project can be performed anywhere. We present promising preliminary work which resulted in two active compounds, that suggests phase II support of the mimic strategy to identify compounds of interest for TB would be a viable strategy. This proposal balances software development, database development and drug discovery activities in order to achieve our goals. We expect this product could be quickly applied to other infectious diseases which have a great societal impact and as a stretch goal we will endeavor to demonstrate this.          We propose to develop an integrated system to facilitate new drug discovery efforts for TB using novel logical inference techniques developed by scientists at SRI International, linked with knowledge which has been assembled by the curation of diverse biological data types and computational prediction by Collaborative Drug Discovery (CDD). This tool will be used to aid the identification of novel therapeutics for tuberculosis by combining cheminformatics, diverse databases and logic-based pathway analysis. We will demonstrate the utility of the tool (available also as a mobile application) and overall workflow ourselves by discovering and developing compounds for TB and other infectious diseases.

"Engineering DNA Delivery Polymers using Combinatorial and Cheminformatics Methods    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the proposed research is to employ chemoenzymatic monomer synthesis, parallel polymer synthesis and cheminformatic modeling for the design and evaluation of polymers for transgene delivery. Gene-based strategies, designed to manipulate cellular phenotype by introducing exogenous genes, are attractive in therapeutic and functional genomics applications. Currently available non-viral (e.g. polymeric) gene delivery vectors are limited by toxicities and suffer from low efficacies. We hypothesize that a synergistic combination of rational chemoenzymatic synthesis of monomers and combinatorial polymer synthesis will lead to the rapid identification polymers with high efficacies for delivering genes to cells (Specific Aim 1). The rapid generation of transfection data will facilitate the construction of predictive Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) cheminformatic models that correlate gene delivery efficacy with polymer and polyplex physicochemical properties (e.g. molecular weight, hydrophobicity, zeta potential, etc.) using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Kernel-Partial Least Squares (K-PLS) regression (Specific Aim 2). A novel QSAR 'model- of models' approach will be developed in which, polymer physicochemical properties will first be estimated using predictive QSAR models based on monomer structure. QSAR models for transgene expression will then be generated using these estimated properties as a result of which, predictions of transgene expression efficacy will be based directly on monomer structures. In the long-term, such predictive QSAR models will aid in the rational design of high-efficacy polymeric transfection agents, which a powerful approach for non-viral gene delivery. Recognizing that polymer-mediated transgene expression suffers from low efficacies, we will employ a combination treatment approach using mediators of intracellular trafficking and transcription (chemotherapeutic enhancers), designed to enhance transgene expression in cells (Specific Aim 3). Finally, effective polymers along with chemotherapeutic enhancers will be employed for delivering genes that encode TRAIL, which selectively induces apoptosis in cancer cells, both in vitro and in vivo (Specific Aim 4). SCID mouse xenograft models will be employed to investigate recession of 22Rv1 prostate tumors, and biodistribution and toxicity of the polymer-plasmid complexes will be investigated. It is anticipated that the proposed research will result in the identification of (1) new effective polymers for non-viral gene delivery, (2) insights into polymer physicochemical factors that influence transgene delivery, (3) predictive QSAR models that will facilitate high-throughput 'in silico' identification of effective polymers, and (4) in vivo efficacy and biodistribution evaluation of polymer-based delivery. It is anticipated that this research will significantly impact gene-based therapeutics, functional genomics, and various applications that depend on high levels of transgene expression in cells. The proposed research will develop novel non-viral (polymeric) materials for gene delivery and evaluate them in vitro and in vivo. These will find significant application in gene therapy for a number of diseases and will expand therapeutic options in these cases.

"Biomarker discovery for mitochondrial toxicants using metabolic footprinting  Abstract Many environmental stressors have deleterious effects on mitochondrial functions, by a variety of mechanisms, and with timelines of different lengths. Mitochondrial dysfunction has multiple clinical presentations, often delayed from the onset of organelle damage. At present, biomarkers that report on mitochondrial function, to enable population studies of environmental exposures and their consequences, are lacking. We propose to identify candidate biomarkers using a metabolomics approach, in greater depth than has previously been applied to toxicologic investigations.  Metabolomic analysis provides a window on cellular and organismal functions, closer to the actual physiology than genomic or transcriptomic arrays. Using multiple platforms for separation and mass spectrometric resolution of complex mixtures, a comprehensive set of metabolites including organic acids, amino acids, steroids, complex lipids, energy charge and mitochondrial transport metabolites can be targeted. We will use this technology to develop biomarkers of mitochondrial dysfunction that will fill an important gap in current studies of environmental toxicology.  We will focus our studies on a polybrominated diphenyl ether, BDE-47, that is emerging as one of the major persistent organic pollutants in the U.S. Published data from our collaborator, Dr. Kavanagh, and our preliminary data indicate that BDE-47 impairs mitochondrial function in cell lines in vitro. Metabolites in extracellular media (metabolic footprinting) will be analyzed with primary mouse hepatocytes, one of the main targets of BDE-47 toxicity, as a function of dose and time of exposure. We will also test the hypothesis that fatty acid overload will uncover subtle mitochondrial defects by performing metabolomic analysis in isolated mitochondria. These studies will provide metabolic signatures of BDE-47 toxicity that will next be extended to in vivo studies of plasma and urine from BDE-47 treated mice. The possibility that lymphocytes may be a surrogate tissue for the mitochondrial toxicities of BDE-47 will be examined using the fatty acid overload assay.  The effects of genetic background and environment on BDE-47 toxicity are poorly understood. We will test two potential modifiers: 1) genetically engineered mice with low and high glutathione levels, and 2) fatty liver due to vitamin A deficiency. These experiments will provide novel information on potential high risk populations for BDE-47 exposure. A key question for these studies will be whether candidate biomarkers scale with toxicity (in addition to exposure dose).  In addition to discovering metabolic signatures of BDE-47 toxicity, we will examine two recently described mitochondrial responses to stress by metabolic footprinting: 1) mitochondrial proteotoxicity due to aggregation of unfolded/unassembled proteins, and 2) alternative fumarate respiration in response to hypoxia and distal block of the electron transport chain. By selecting defined mitochondrial responses, one adverse and one adaptive, we begin to categorize mitochondrial dysfunction and look for signatures that associate with specific types. In the case of fumarate respiration, a signature of high levels of succinate in secreted metabolites is already known.  This work is a close collaboration with Oliver Fiehn, expert in metabolomics screening and data analysis, and Terry Kavanagh, an expert in oxidative stress and mitochondrial toxicology.  Public Health Relevance/Project Narrative Many environmental toxins inhibit mitochondria, the powerhouses of the cell, as a mechanism of toxicity. Current research in this area is hampered by the lack of convenient tests to measure early mitochondrial damage, which would promote appropriate preventive/treatment efforts for individuals and at risk populations. The goal of this research is to identify chemical changes in blood or urine that are indicators of mitochondrial damage in the body, using mass spectrometry tools to survey thousands of compounds.",Biomarker discovery for mitochondrial toxicants using metabolic footprinting,8691819,R01ES020819,"['abstracting ', ' Affect ', ' aminoacid ', ' Amino Acids ', ' Biological Chemistry ', ' Biochemistry ', ' Bioenergetics ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biology ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Body Fluids ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cells ', ' Charge ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' electron transfer ', ' Electron Transport ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Exhibits ', ' Fatty Acids ', ' hepatic steatosis ', ' Liver Steatosis ', ' Fatty Liver ', ' Fumarates ', ' gamma-L-Glutamyl-L-Cysteinylglycine ', ' gamma-L-Glu-L-Cys-Gly ', ' Glycine, N-(N-L-gamma-glutamyl-L-cysteinyl)- ', ' Glutathione ', ' Goals ', ' histocompatibility typing ', ' Tissue Typing ', ' Tissue Crossmatching ', ' Histocompatibility Testing ', ' In Vitro ', ' Lipids ', ' lymph cell ', ' Lymphocytic ', ' Lymphocyte ', ' Transmembrane Potentials ', ' Resting Potentials ', ' Membrane Potentials ', ' Methods ', ' mitochondrial ', ' Mitochondria ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' Organelles ', ' Physiology ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma ', ' gene product ', ' Proteins ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' respiratory mechanism ', ' Respiration ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' statistics ', ' Steroid Compound ', ' Steroids ', ' Stress ', ' Succinates ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' environmental toxicant ', ' Toxic Environmental Agents ', ' Environmental Toxin ', ' Toxic Environmental Substances ', ' Toxicology ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Urine ', ' Vitamin A ', ' Vitamin A Deficiency ', ' Work ', ' diphenyl ether ', ' phenyl ether ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' TimeLine ', ' Pro-Oxidants ', ' Oxygen Radicals ', ' Active Oxygen ', ' Reactive Oxygen Species ', ' base ', ' ecological toxicology ', ' environmental toxicology ', ' human population study ', ' Distal ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Biochemical ', ' Chemicals ', ' Liver Cells ', ' Hepatic Parenchymal Cell ', ' Hepatic Cells ', ' Hepatocyte ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Oxygen Deficiency ', ' Hypoxic ', ' Hypoxia ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Collaborations ', ' liquid ', ' fluid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' Metabolic ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' organic acid ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' extracellular ', ' environmental stressor ', ' Purines/Pyrimidines/Nucleotides/Nucleic Acids Metabolism ', ' Nucleotide Synthesis ', ' nucleotide metabolism ', ' pollutant ', ' toxicant ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' novel ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Population Study ', ' Reporting ', ' mitochondrial disease/disorder ', ' Mitochondrial Disorders ', ' Mitochondrial Diseases ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Genomics ', ' Metabolic syndrome ', ' Complex Mixtures ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabolomics ', ' Length ', ' Dose ', ' Preventive ', ' Defect ', ' Data ', ' Harvest ', ' Preclinical Models ', ' Pre-Clinical Model ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Characteristics ', ' Genetically Engineered Mouse ', ' protein mis-folding ', ' pathologic protein folding ', ' abnormal protein folding ', ' aberrant protein folding ', ' protein misfolding ', ' Population ', ' Metabolic stress ', ' transcriptomics ', ' mitochondrial dysfunction ', ' nonalcoholic steato-hepatitis ', ' non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ', ' non-alcoholic steato-hepatitis ', ' non-alcohol induced steatohepatitis ', ' NASH ', ' nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' screening ', ' ']",NIEHS,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2014,373821,WA-07,0.05882638332463442
"Predictive Smoking Cessation Preclinical Battery DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite great advances in both the understanding of the neurobiology of addiction and the development and approval of smoking cessation therapies, a significant need remains for better smoking cessation aids. Our goal is aligned with NIDA's intent to bring the power of science to bear on drug abuse and addiction. We propose to use tools from a broad range of disciplines, and promise rapid and effective dissemination and use of the results of the proposed research to significantly improve treatment of nicotine abuse and addiction. The platform we propose to use will help identify, evaluate, and develop innovative medications to treat nicotine abuse and addiction. We propose to implement a research program through collaborations with academia, industry and government. Although there are two first-line (varenicline and bupropion) and two second-line (clonidine and notriptyline) approved medications for smoking cessation that significantly help to stop smoking, about 80% of smokers are unable to remain abstinent. As an explanation for such low success rate, it has been hypothesized that addiction develops in the presence of predisposing cognitive and affective states, which are unaffected by existing therapeutics but could be targeted by new smoking cessation aids for improved efficacy. One of the main reasons for the slow development of novel medications with improved efficacy is the lack of clearly translatable preclinical models of nicotine dependence that exhibit high degrees of predictive validity. Most preclinical tests are simply based on blocking nicotine-like effects but ignore other predisposing or underlying factors, either cognitive or emotional, that may trigger and maintain nicotine abuse. The availability of both approved medications and failed compounds gives us the opportunity to create a battery of nicotine dependence and CNS efficacy tests with enhanced predictive validity, potentially a key tool in enhancing future discovery and development efforts. During Phase I we will develop a test battery based on 1) consideration of multiple aspects underlying abuse (rewarding effects of acute and chronic nicotine, alleviation of withdrawal, relapse, anxiety, depression, cognitive dysfunction and impulsivity), 2) definition of a smoking cessation predictive score through a machine learning algorithm trained on a behavioral dataset generated with both effective and ineffective medications in our test battery and 3) minimization of animal and throughput costs. During Phase II the platform will grow to comprise a database of compounds and mechanisms of action of postulated smoking cessation potential, prioritized by their smoking cessation scores and predicted superiority in combating emotional and cognitive aspects of nicotine dependence. Finally, this platform (battery, database and computational tools) will be offered during Phase III as drug screening method to the members of a private public partnership, created to maintain, support, further develop and publicize the platform. The novelty of this project resides in the combination of economic principles and bioinformatics methods to take advantage of existing smoking cessation FDA-approved gold standards, the inclusion of cognitive and emotional state-relevant testing in the proposed preclinical battery, the creation of a knowledge database, and the management of the final platform by a private-public consortium to ensure maximal quality, value and access. We expect that the knowledge and tools generate by this project will stimulate further research and drug development both for smoking cessation and across other areas of drug abuse and discovery.         Predictive Smoking Cessation Preclinical Battery Despite great advances in both the understanding of the neurobiology of addiction and the development and approval of smoking cessation therapies, a significant need remains for better smoking cessation aids. Our goal is aligned with NIDA's intent to bring the power of science to bear on drug abuse and addiction.

The platform we propose to use will help identify, evaluate, and develop innovative medications to treat nicotine abuse and addiction. We propose to implement a research program through collaborations with academia, industry and government. The existence of several medications for smoking cessation create a major opportunity for the creation of improved research tools for the discovery and development of novel, and more effective, smoking cessation medications. We propose to compare effective smoking cessation medications against ineffective medications in a comprehensive preclinical test battery to capture those features that best separate the two drug sets. We will use novel statistical and computational tools to determine which subset of faster and cheaper tests is necessary to distinguish these two classes to create an optimized predictive test battery. We will then characterize a series of compounds that are thought to be promising candidates for future anti- smoking medications using the novel screening battery. Using bioinformatics methods we will compare these promising compounds against the set of efficacious FDA-approved compounds and assign them a predictive score that represents the likelihood that such compounds will be effective in the clinic. We will further prioritize compounds that show additional positive features such as pro-cognitive or anxiolytic effects. If successful, this projet will have a dramatic impact on the cost and efficiency of the discovery and development of novel smoking cessation medications, ultimately saving millions of lives and millions of dollars in lost economic output and healthcare costs.",Predictive Smoking Cessation Preclinical Battery,8901369,R44DA035051,"['Action Potentials ', ' Algorithms ', ' Animals ', ' Antidepressants ', ' Antidepressant Drugs ', ' Antidepressant Agent ', ' Antidepressive Agents ', ' Anxiety ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Klofenil ', ' 1H-Imidazol-2-amine, N-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)-4,5-dihydro- ', ' Clonidine ', ' Cognition ', ' 2(1H)-Pyrimidinone, 4-amino- ', ' Cytosine ', ' Decision Theory ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' abuses drugs ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' Drug abuse ', ' Evaluation Studies, Drug, Preclinical ', ' Evaluation Studies, Drug, Pre-Clinical ', ' Drug Screening ', ' Preclinical Drug Evaluation ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Economics ', ' Exhibits ', ' N-Methyl-gamma-(4-(trifluoromethyl)phenoxy)benzenepropanamine ', ' Fluoxetin ', ' Fluoxetine ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Au element ', ' Gold ', ' Government ', ' Industry ', ' Ligands ', ' Marketing ', ' Bicyclo(2.2.1)heptan-2-amine, N,2,3,3-tetramethyl- ', ' Mecamylamine ', ' Methods ', ' Narcanti ', ' Narcan ', ' Morphinan-6-one, 4,5-epoxy-3,14-dihydroxy-17-(2-propenyl)-, (5alpha)- ', ' Naloxone ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurobiology ', ' Pyridine, 3-(1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)-, (S)- ', ' Nicotine ', ' nicotine addiction ', ' Nicotine Dependence ', ' Nicotine Withdrawal ', ' Desmethylamitriptylin ', ' Desitriptyline ', ' 1-Propanamine, 3-(10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo(a,d)cyclohepten-5-ylidene)-N-methyl- ', ' Nortriptyline ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' research and development ', ' Rewards ', ' Science ', ' welfare ', ' Social Welfare ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' antianxiety agent ', ' Minor Tranquilizing Agents ', ' Anxiolytics ', ' Anxiolytic Agents ', ' Anti-Anxiety Drugs ', ' Anti-Anxiety Agents ', ' Moclobamide ', ' Benzamide, 4-Chloro-N-(2-(4-morpholinyl)ethyl)- ', ' Moclobemide ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' smoking cessation ', ' buproprion ', ' Amfebutamone ', ' Bupropion ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Series ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Stimulus ', ' Conditioned Stimulus ', ' Discipline ', ' Withdrawal ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Nicotinic Cholinergic Agonists ', ' Nicotinic Agonists ', ' gamma-Aminobutyric Acid Agonists ', ' GABA Receptor Agonists ', ' GABA Agonists ', ' Agonist ', ' Collaborations ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' Smoker ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' interest ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' receptor ', ' success ', ' trait ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' database management ', ' Data Base Management ', ' behavioral test ', ' behavior test ', ' nicotine abuse ', ' drug abuse nicotine ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Emotional ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Property ', ' drug development ', ' drug discovery ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Drug Dependency ', ' Drug Dependence ', ' Chemical Dependence ', ' Drug Addiction ', ' Academia ', ' Preclinical Models ', ' Pre-Clinical Model ', ' Preclinical Testing ', ' anti-smoking ', ' Antismoking ', ' Cognitive ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' varenicline ', ' Output ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' cost ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' clinical efficacy ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Affective ', ' addictive disorder ', ' addiction ', ' combat ', ' FDA approved ', ' efficacy testing ', ' public-private partnership ', ' screening ', ' ']",NIDA,"PSYCHOGENICS, INC.",R44,2014,691074,NJ-05,-0.017497446740159597
"Engineering DNA Delivery Polymers using Combinatorial and Cheminformatics Methods    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the proposed research is to employ chemoenzymatic monomer synthesis, parallel polymer synthesis and cheminformatic modeling for the design and evaluation of polymers for transgene delivery. Gene-based strategies, designed to manipulate cellular phenotype by introducing exogenous genes, are attractive in therapeutic and functional genomics applications. Currently available non-viral (e.g. polymeric) gene delivery vectors are limited by toxicities and suffer from low efficacies. We hypothesize that a synergistic combination of rational chemoenzymatic synthesis of monomers and combinatorial polymer synthesis will lead to the rapid identification polymers with high efficacies for delivering genes to cells (Specific Aim 1). The rapid generation of transfection data will facilitate the construction of predictive Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) cheminformatic models that correlate gene delivery efficacy with polymer and polyplex physicochemical properties (e.g. molecular weight, hydrophobicity, zeta potential, etc.) using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Kernel-Partial Least Squares (K-PLS) regression (Specific Aim 2). A novel QSAR 'model- of models' approach will be developed in which, polymer physicochemical properties will first be estimated using predictive QSAR models based on monomer structure. QSAR models for transgene expression will then be generated using these estimated properties as a result of which, predictions of transgene expression efficacy will be based directly on monomer structures. In the long-term, such predictive QSAR models will aid in the rational design of high-efficacy polymeric transfection agents, which a powerful approach for non-viral gene delivery. Recognizing that polymer-mediated transgene expression suffers from low efficacies, we will employ a combination treatment approach using mediators of intracellular trafficking and transcription (chemotherapeutic enhancers), designed to enhance transgene expression in cells (Specific Aim 3). Finally, effective polymers along with chemotherapeutic enhancers will be employed for delivering genes that encode TRAIL, which selectively induces apoptosis in cancer cells, both in vitro and in vivo (Specific Aim 4). SCID mouse xenograft models will be employed to investigate recession of 22Rv1 prostate tumors, and biodistribution and toxicity of the polymer-plasmid complexes will be investigated. It is anticipated that the proposed research will result in the identification of (1) new effective polymers for non-viral gene delivery, (2) insights into polymer physicochemical factors that influence transgene delivery, (3) predictive QSAR models that will facilitate high-throughput 'in silico' identification of effective polymers, and (4) in vivo efficacy and biodistribution evaluation of polymer-based delivery. It is anticipated that this research will significantly impact gene-based therapeutics, functional genomics, and various applications that depend on high levels of transgene expression in cells. The proposed research will develop novel non-viral (polymeric) materials for gene delivery and evaluate them in vitro and in vivo. These will find significant application in gene therapy for a number of diseases and will expand therapeutic options in these cases.

"Human iPS/ES Cell-Based Models for Predictive Neural Toxicity and Teratogenicity DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal brings together leading experts in human pluripotent stem cell biology (Thomson), tissue engineering (Murphy), and machine learning (Page) to develop improved human cellular models for predicting developmental neural toxicity. Dramatic progress has been made in the derivation of many of the basic cellular components of the brain from human pluripotent stem cells (ES and iPS cells), but these advances have yet to be applied to predictive toxicology. The major components of the brain are derived from diverse embryological origins, including the neural plate (neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes), yolk sac myeloid progenitors (microglia), migratory mesodermal angioblasts (endothelial cells), and neural crest (vascular smooth muscle and pericytes). Because of their diverse origins, these components have very different inductive signaling histories. This means that deriving them all at once under the same conditions is not currently possible. For this reason, we will differentiate human pluripotent stem cells to early precursors of the major neural, glial, and vascular components of the cerebral cortex separately, cryopreserve the precursors, and subsequently combine them in 3D hydrogel assemblies to allow increased physiological interactions and maturation. Specifically, we will embed committed precursors for endothelial cells, pericytes, and microglia into hydrogels displaying combinations of peptide motifs that promote capillary network formation. We will then overlay this mesenchymal layer with neural and glial precursors to mimic the normal interactions between the cephalic mesenchyme and the neural epithelium, and promote the formation of the polarized layers of the cerebral cortex. After drug exposure, we will assess temporal changes in gene expression by these cerebral neural- vascular assemblies using highly multiplexed, deep RNA sequencing. Then, using safe drugs and known neural/developmental toxins from the NIH Clinical Collection, the University of Washington Teratogen Information System Database, and the EPA's Toxicity Reference Database as training sets, we will develop machine learning algorithms to predict neural toxicity of blinded drugs known to have failed in late stage animal testing or human clinical trials. This predictive, developmental neural toxicity model will be implemented on liquid handling robots and sequencers in widespread use, and will be readily adaptable to platforms being developed in complementary efforts by DARPA. The developmental potential of human pluripotent stem cells, the modular nature of the tunable hydrogels, and the discriminatory power of machine learning tools also makes the general approaches proposed readily applicable to predictive toxicity models for other tissue types throughout the body. This project will develop three-dimensional constructs of human neural tissue to better predict the neural toxicity of drugs prior to clinical trials. To accomplish this, experts in human pluripotent stem cell biology will grow the required neural components in the laboratory, experts in tissue engineers will assemble those cells into multicellular constructs, and experts in machine learning will use changes in gene expression after drug exposure to predict whether a test compound is toxic.",Human iPS/ES Cell-Based Models for Predictive Neural Toxicity and Teratogenicity,8768889,UH3TR000506,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Algorithms ', ' Astroglia ', ' Astrocytus ', ' Astrocytes ', ' vascular ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Capillaries ', ' Blood capillaries ', ' Cells ', ' Cerebral cortex ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Drug toxicity ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Epithelium ', ' Fetus ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Hedgehogs ', ' Erinaceidae ', ' histocompatibility typing ', ' Tissue Typing ', ' Tissue Crossmatching ', ' Histocompatibility Testing ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' Information Systems ', ' Laboratories ', ' Muscle, Smooth, Vascular ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Neural Crest ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' Oligodendroglia Cell ', ' Oligodendrocytus ', ' Oligodendrocytes ', ' Oligodendroglia ', ' Peptides ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Teratogens ', ' Testing ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Toxicology ', ' Toxin ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' vitelline sac ', ' Yolk Sac ', ' notch receptors ', ' notch ', ' notch protein ', ' Mediating ', ' Blinded ', ' RNA Sequences ', ' Mesenchymas ', ' Mesenchyme ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Cranial ', ' Cephalic ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' perivascular glial cell ', ' microgliocyte ', ' microglial cell ', ' mesoglia ', ' gitter cell ', ' Hortega cell ', ' Microglia ', ' Tyrosine Kinase Receptors ', ' Tyrosine Kinase Linked Receptors ', ' Tyrosine Kinase Growth Factor Receptor ', ' Transmembrane Receptor Protein Tyrosine Kinase ', ' PTK Receptors ', ' Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases ', ' Training ', ' Endothelial Cells ', ' cerebral ', ' Cerebrum ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Human Figure ', ' Human body ', ' liquid ', ' fluid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' Exposure to ', ' Staging ', ' Robot ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Myeloid ', ' Myelogenous ', ' engineered tissue ', ' Tissue Engineering ', ' stem cell of embryonic origin ', ' ES cell ', ' embryonic stem cell ', ' experience ', ' Rouget Cells ', ' Perivascular Cell ', ' Pericapillary Cell ', ' Adventitial Cell ', ' Pericytes ', ' toxicant ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Neural Development ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Hydrogels ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Drug Exposure ', ' Modeling ', ' prenatally exposed ', ' prenatal exposure ', ' Pluripotent Stem Cells ', ' drug development ', ' neural plate ', ' capillary ', ' Commit ', ' cognitive change ', ' Animal Testing ', ' Mesenchymal ', ' molecular signature ', ' molecular profile ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' Expression Signature ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' Angioblast ', ' Collection ', ' Rodent Model ', ' Derivation ', ' Derivation procedure ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' Cellular model ', ' Cell model ', ' progenitor ', ' iPSC ', ' iPS ', ' induced pluripotent stem cell ', ' precursor cell ', ' stem cell biology ', ' in vitro testing ', ' RNA-seq ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' ']",NCATS,"MORGRIDGE INSTITUTE FOR RESEARCH, INC.",UH3,2014,2020212,WI-02,0.10114421321198222
"Biomarker discovery for mitochondrial toxicants using metabolic footprinting Abstract Many environmental stressors have deleterious effects on mitochondrial functions, by a variety of mechanisms, and with timelines of different lengths. Mitochondrial dysfunction has multiple clinical presentations, often delayed from the onset of organelle damage. At present, biomarkers that report on mitochondrial function, to enable population studies of environmental exposures and their consequences, are lacking. We propose to identify candidate biomarkers using a metabolomics approach, in greater depth than has previously been applied to toxicologic investigations.  Metabolomic analysis provides a window on cellular and organismal functions, closer to the actual physiology than genomic or transcriptomic arrays. Using multiple platforms for separation and mass spectrometric resolution of complex mixtures, a comprehensive set of metabolites including organic acids, amino acids, steroids, complex lipids, energy charge and mitochondrial transport metabolites can be targeted. We will use this technology to develop biomarkers of mitochondrial dysfunction that will fill an important gap in current studies of environmental toxicology.  We will focus our studies on a polybrominated diphenyl ether, BDE-47, that is emerging as one of the major persistent organic pollutants in the U.S. Published data from our collaborator, Dr. Kavanagh, and our preliminary data indicate that BDE-47 impairs mitochondrial function in cell lines in vitro. Metabolites in extracellular media (metabolic footprinting) will be analyzed with primary mouse hepatocytes, one of the main targets of BDE-47 toxicity, as a function of dose and time of exposure. We will also test the hypothesis that fatty acid overload will uncover subtle mitochondrial defects by performing metabolomic analysis in isolated mitochondria. These studies will provide metabolic signatures of BDE-47 toxicity that will next be extended to in vivo studies of plasma and urine from BDE-47 treated mice. The possibility that lymphocytes may be a surrogate tissue for the mitochondrial toxicities of BDE-47 will be examined using the fatty acid overload assay.  The effects of genetic background and environment on BDE-47 toxicity are poorly understood. We will test two potential modifiers: 1) genetically engineered mice with low and high glutathione levels, and 2) fatty liver due to vitamin A deficiency. These experiments will provide novel information on potential high risk populations for BDE-47 exposure. A key question for these studies will be whether candidate biomarkers scale with toxicity (in addition to exposure dose).  In addition to discovering metabolic signatures of BDE-47 toxicity, we will examine two recently described mitochondrial responses to stress by metabolic footprinting: 1) mitochondrial proteotoxicity due to aggregation of unfolded/unassembled proteins, and 2) alternative fumarate respiration in response to hypoxia and distal block of the electron transport chain. By selecting defined mitochondrial responses, one adverse and one adaptive, we begin to categorize mitochondrial dysfunction and look for signatures that associate with specific types. In the case of fumarate respiration, a signature of high levels of succinate in secreted metabolites is already known.  This work is a close collaboration with Oliver Fiehn, expert in metabolomics screening and data analysis, and Terry Kavanagh, an expert in oxidative stress and mitochondrial toxicology. Public Health Relevance/Project Narrative Many environmental toxins inhibit mitochondria, the powerhouses of the cell, as a mechanism of toxicity. Current research in this area is hampered by the lack of convenient tests to measure early mitochondrial damage, which would promote appropriate preventive/treatment efforts for individuals and at risk populations. The goal of this research is to identify chemical changes in blood or urine that are indicators of mitochondrial damage in the body, using mass spectrometry tools to survey thousands of compounds.",Biomarker discovery for mitochondrial toxicants using metabolic footprinting,8874981,R01ES020819,"['abstracting ', ' Affect ', ' aminoacid ', ' Amino Acids ', ' Biological Chemistry ', ' Biochemistry ', ' Bioenergetics ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biology ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Body Fluids ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cells ', ' Charge ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' electron transfer ', ' Electron Transport ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Exhibits ', ' Fatty Acids ', ' hepatic steatosis ', ' Liver Steatosis ', ' Fatty Liver ', ' Fumarates ', ' gamma-L-Glutamyl-L-Cysteinylglycine ', ' gamma-L-Glu-L-Cys-Gly ', ' Glycine, N-(N-L-gamma-glutamyl-L-cysteinyl)- ', ' Glutathione ', ' Goals ', ' histocompatibility typing ', ' Tissue Typing ', ' Tissue Crossmatching ', ' Histocompatibility Testing ', ' In Vitro ', ' Lipids ', ' lymph cell ', ' Lymphocytic ', ' Lymphocyte ', ' Transmembrane Potentials ', ' Resting Potentials ', ' Membrane Potentials ', ' Methods ', ' mitochondrial ', ' Mitochondria ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' Organelles ', ' Physiology ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma ', ' gene product ', ' Proteins ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' respiratory mechanism ', ' Respiration ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' statistics ', ' Steroid Compound ', ' Steroids ', ' Stress ', ' Succinates ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' environmental toxicant ', ' Toxic Environmental Agents ', ' Environmental Toxin ', ' Toxic Environmental Substances ', ' Toxicology ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Urine ', ' Vitamin A ', ' Vitamin A Deficiency ', ' Work ', ' diphenyl ether ', ' phenyl ether ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' TimeLine ', ' Pro-Oxidants ', ' Oxygen Radicals ', ' Active Oxygen ', ' Reactive Oxygen Species ', ' base ', ' ecological toxicology ', ' environmental toxicology ', ' human population study ', ' Distal ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Biochemical ', ' Chemicals ', ' Liver Cells ', ' Hepatic Parenchymal Cell ', ' Hepatic Cells ', ' Hepatocyte ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Oxygen Deficiency ', ' Hypoxic ', ' Hypoxia ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Collaborations ', ' liquid ', ' fluid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' Metabolic ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' organic acid ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' extracellular ', ' environmental stressor ', ' Purines/Pyrimidines/Nucleotides/Nucleic Acids Metabolism ', ' Nucleotide Synthesis ', ' nucleotide metabolism ', ' pollutant ', ' toxicant ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' novel ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Population Study ', ' Reporting ', ' mitochondrial disease/disorder ', ' Mitochondrial Disorders ', ' Mitochondrial Diseases ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Genomics ', ' Metabolic syndrome ', ' Complex Mixtures ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabolomics ', ' Length ', ' Dose ', ' Preventive ', ' Defect ', ' Data ', ' Harvest ', ' Preclinical Models ', ' Pre-Clinical Model ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Characteristics ', ' Genetically Engineered Mouse ', ' protein mis-folding ', ' pathologic protein folding ', ' abnormal protein folding ', ' aberrant protein folding ', ' protein misfolding ', ' Population ', ' Metabolic stress ', ' transcriptomics ', ' mitochondrial dysfunction ', ' nonalcoholic steato-hepatitis ', ' non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ', ' non-alcoholic steato-hepatitis ', ' non-alcohol induced steatohepatitis ', ' NASH ', ' nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' screening ', ' ']",NIEHS,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2015,377291,WA-07,0.05882638332463442
"Engineering DNA Delivery Polymers using Combinatorial and Cheminformatics Methods DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the proposed research is to employ chemoenzymatic monomer synthesis, parallel polymer synthesis and cheminformatic modeling for the design and evaluation of polymers for transgene delivery. Gene-based strategies, designed to manipulate cellular phenotype by introducing exogenous genes, are attractive in therapeutic and functional genomics applications. Currently available non-viral (e.g. polymeric) gene delivery vectors are limited by toxicities and suffer from low efficacies. We hypothesize that a synergistic combination of rational chemoenzymatic synthesis of monomers and combinatorial polymer synthesis will lead to the rapid identification polymers with high efficacies for delivering genes to cells (Specific Aim 1). The rapid generation of transfection data will facilitate the construction of predictive Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) cheminformatic models that correlate gene delivery efficacy with polymer and polyplex physicochemical properties (e.g. molecular weight, hydrophobicity, zeta potential, etc.) using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Kernel-Partial Least Squares (K-PLS) regression (Specific Aim 2). A novel QSAR 'model- of models' approach will be developed in which, polymer physicochemical properties will first be estimated using predictive QSAR models based on monomer structure. QSAR models for transgene expression will then be generated using these estimated properties as a result of which, predictions of transgene expression efficacy will be based directly on monomer structures. In the long-term, such predictive QSAR models will aid in the rational design of high-efficacy polymeric transfection agents, which a powerful approach for non-viral gene delivery. Recognizing that polymer-mediated transgene expression suffers from low efficacies, we will employ a combination treatment approach using mediators of intracellular trafficking and transcription (chemotherapeutic enhancers), designed to enhance transgene expression in cells (Specific Aim 3). Finally, effective polymers along with chemotherapeutic enhancers will be employed for delivering genes that encode TRAIL, which selectively induces apoptosis in cancer cells, both in vitro and in vivo (Specific Aim 4). SCID mouse xenograft models will be employed to investigate recession of 22Rv1 prostate tumors, and biodistribution and toxicity of the polymer-plasmid complexes will be investigated. It is anticipated that the proposed research will result in the identification of (1) new effective polymers for non-viral gene delivery, (2) insights into polymer physicochemical factors that influence transgene delivery, (3) predictive QSAR models that will facilitate high-throughput 'in silico' identification of effective polymers, and (4) in vivo efficacy and biodistribution evaluation of polymer-based delivery. It is anticipated that this research will significantly impact gene-based therapeutics, functional genomics, and various applications that depend on high levels of transgene expression in cells. The proposed research will develop novel non-viral (polymeric) materials for gene delivery and evaluate them in vitro and in vivo. These will find significant application in gene therapy for a number of diseases and will expand therapeutic options in these cases.

"HLS13-04 High-Content High-Throughput Screen for Diamond Blackfan Anemia Treatments ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There are thousands of rare genetic diseases that have no approved treatment. Recursion Pharmaceuticals has developed a drug discovery platform that seeks to re-purpose known drugs for the treatment of such diseases. The platform consists of high content immunofluorescent image analysis using machine-learning algorithms to identify relevant and on-target changes induced by both RNAi and various chemicals. This system has been used to identify a phenotype for loss of function of two related genes, RPS19 and RPS10 in multiple human cell types. Mutations in these genes are the primary cause of Diamond Blackfan Anemia, a rare genetic disease with no specific targeted therapy. In this grant, we propose to: develop RPS19 and RPS10 knockout cell lines using CRISPR/Cas9 technology; evaluate knockout cell lines for phenotypes ('phenoprints') using our drug discovery platform; conduct chemical suppressor screens of thousands of known drug candidates to identify those that  ameliorate on-target phenoprints associated with loss of RPS19 and RPS10; expand the capabilities of our drug screening platform to enable the use of non-adherent cell lines in  our workflow and use the expanded capabilities to confirm the validity of drugs identifie as candidate therapies in  CD34+ suspended cell culture models of Diamond Blackfan Anemia.

To accomplish this, experts in human pluripotent stem cell biology will grow the required neural components in the laboratory, experts in tissue engineers will assemble those cells into multicellular constructs, and experts in machine learning will use changes in gene expression after drug exposure to predict whether a test compound is toxic.",Human iPS/ES Cell-Based Models for Predictive Neural Toxicity and Teratogenicity,8929339,UH3TR000506,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Algorithms ', ' Astroglia ', ' Astrocytus ', ' Astrocytes ', ' vascular ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Capillaries ', ' Blood capillaries ', ' Cells ', ' Cerebral cortex ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Drug toxicity ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Epithelium ', ' Fetus ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Hedgehogs ', ' Erinaceidae ', ' histocompatibility typing ', ' Tissue Typing ', ' Tissue Crossmatching ', ' Histocompatibility Testing ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' Information Systems ', ' Laboratories ', ' Muscle, Smooth, Vascular ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Neural Crest ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' Oligodendroglia Cell ', ' Oligodendrocytus ', ' Oligodendrocytes ', ' Oligodendroglia ', ' Peptides ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Teratogens ', ' Testing ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Toxicology ', ' Toxin ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' vitelline sac ', ' Yolk Sac ', ' notch receptors ', ' notch ', ' notch protein ', ' Mediating ', ' Blinded ', ' RNA Sequences ', ' Mesenchymas ', ' Mesenchyme ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Cranial ', ' Cephalic ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' perivascular glial cell ', ' microgliocyte ', ' microglial cell ', ' mesoglia ', ' gitter cell ', ' Hortega cell ', ' Microglia ', ' Tyrosine Kinase Receptors ', ' Tyrosine Kinase Linked Receptors ', ' Tyrosine Kinase Growth Factor Receptor ', ' Transmembrane Receptor Protein Tyrosine Kinase ', ' PTK Receptors ', ' Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases ', ' Training ', ' Endothelial Cells ', ' cerebral ', ' Cerebrum ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Human Figure ', ' Human body ', ' liquid ', ' fluid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' Exposure to ', ' Staging ', ' Robot ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Myeloid ', ' Myelogenous ', ' engineered tissue ', ' Tissue Engineering ', ' stem cell of embryonic origin ', ' ES cell ', ' embryonic stem cell ', ' experience ', ' Rouget Cells ', ' Perivascular Cell ', ' Pericapillary Cell ', ' Adventitial Cell ', ' Pericytes ', ' toxicant ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Neural Development ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Hydrogels ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Drug Exposure ', ' Modeling ', ' prenatally exposed ', ' prenatal exposure ', ' Pluripotent Stem Cells ', ' drug development ', ' neural plate ', ' capillary ', ' cognitive change ', ' Animal Testing ', ' Mesenchymal ', ' molecular signature ', ' molecular profile ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' Expression Signature ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' Angioblast ', ' Collection ', ' Rodent Model ', ' Derivation ', ' Derivation procedure ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' Cellular model ', ' Cell model ', ' progenitor ', ' iPSC ', ' iPS ', ' induced pluripotent stem cell ', ' precursor cell ', ' stem cell biology ', ' in vitro testing ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA-seq ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' ']",NCATS,"MORGRIDGE INSTITUTE FOR RESEARCH, INC.",UH3,2015,1991327,WI-02,0.10114421321198222
"Predictive Smoking Cessation Preclinical Battery DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite great advances in both the understanding of the neurobiology of addiction and the development and approval of smoking cessation therapies, a significant need remains for better smoking cessation aids. Our goal is aligned with NIDA's intent to bring the power of science to bear on drug abuse and addiction. We propose to use tools from a broad range of disciplines, and promise rapid and effective dissemination and use of the results of the proposed research to significantly improve treatment of nicotine abuse and addiction. The platform we propose to use will help identify, evaluate, and develop innovative medications to treat nicotine abuse and addiction. We propose to implement a research program through collaborations with academia, industry and government. Although there are two first-line (varenicline and bupropion) and two second-line (clonidine and notriptyline) approved medications for smoking cessation that significantly help to stop smoking, about 80% of smokers are unable to remain abstinent. As an explanation for such low success rate, it has been hypothesized that addiction develops in the presence of predisposing cognitive and affective states, which are unaffected by existing therapeutics but could be targeted by new smoking cessation aids for improved efficacy. One of the main reasons for the slow development of novel medications with improved efficacy is the lack of clearly translatable preclinical models of nicotine dependence that exhibit high degrees of predictive validity. Most preclinical tests are simply based on blocking nicotine-like effects but ignore other predisposing or underlying factors, either cognitive or emotional, that may trigger and maintain nicotine abuse. The availability of both approved medications and failed compounds gives us the opportunity to create a battery of nicotine dependence and CNS efficacy tests with enhanced predictive validity, potentially a key tool in enhancing future discovery and development efforts. During Phase I we will develop a test battery based on 1) consideration of multiple aspects underlying abuse (rewarding effects of acute and chronic nicotine, alleviation of withdrawal, relapse, anxiety, depression, cognitive dysfunction and impulsivity), 2) definition of a smoking cessation predictive score through a machine learning algorithm trained on a behavioral dataset generated with both effective and ineffective medications in our test battery and 3) minimization of animal and throughput costs. During Phase II the platform will grow to comprise a database of compounds and mechanisms of action of postulated smoking cessation potential, prioritized by their smoking cessation scores and predicted superiority in combating emotional and cognitive aspects of nicotine dependence. Finally, this platform (battery, database and computational tools) will be offered during Phase III as drug screening method to the members of a private public partnership, created to maintain, support, further develop and publicize the platform. The novelty of this project resides in the combination of economic principles and bioinformatics methods to take advantage of existing smoking cessation FDA-approved gold standards, the inclusion of cognitive and emotional state-relevant testing in the proposed preclinical battery, the creation of a knowledge database, and the management of the final platform by a private-public consortium to ensure maximal quality, value and access. We expect that the knowledge and tools generate by this project will stimulate further research and drug development both for smoking cessation and across other areas of drug abuse and discovery. Predictive Smoking Cessation Preclinical Battery Despite great advances in both the understanding of the neurobiology of addiction and the development and approval of smoking cessation therapies, a significant need remains for better smoking cessation aids. Our goal is aligned with NIDA's intent to bring the power of science to bear on drug abuse and addiction.

The platform we propose to use will help identify, evaluate, and develop innovative medications to treat nicotine abuse and addiction. We propose to implement a research program through collaborations with academia, industry and government. The existence of several medications for smoking cessation create a major opportunity for the creation of improved research tools for the discovery and development of novel, and more effective, smoking cessation medications. We propose to compare effective smoking cessation medications against ineffective medications in a comprehensive preclinical test battery to capture those features that best separate the two drug sets. We will use novel statistical and computational tools to determine which subset of faster and cheaper tests is necessary to distinguish these two classes to create an optimized predictive test battery. We will then characterize a series of compounds that are thought to be promising candidates for future anti- smoking medications using the novel screening battery. Using bioinformatics methods we will compare these promising compounds against the set of efficacious FDA-approved compounds and assign them a predictive score that represents the likelihood that such compounds will be effective in the clinic. We will further prioritize compounds that show additional positive features such as pro-cognitive or anxiolytic effects. If successful, this projet will have a dramatic impact on the cost and efficiency of the discovery and development of novel smoking cessation medications, ultimately saving millions of lives and millions of dollars in lost economic output and healthcare costs.",Predictive Smoking Cessation Preclinical Battery,8934076,R44DA035051,"['Action Potentials ', ' Algorithms ', ' Animals ', ' Antidepressants ', ' Antidepressant Drugs ', ' Antidepressant Agent ', ' Antidepressive Agents ', ' Anxiety ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Klofenil ', ' 1H-Imidazol-2-amine, N-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)-4,5-dihydro- ', ' Clonidine ', ' Cognition ', ' 2(1H)-Pyrimidinone, 4-amino- ', ' Cytosine ', ' Decision Theory ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' abuses drugs ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' Drug abuse ', ' Evaluation Studies, Drug, Preclinical ', ' Evaluation Studies, Drug, Pre-Clinical ', ' Drug Screening ', ' Preclinical Drug Evaluation ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Economics ', ' Exhibits ', ' N-Methyl-gamma-(4-(trifluoromethyl)phenoxy)benzenepropanamine ', ' Fluoxetin ', ' Fluoxetine ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Au element ', ' Gold ', ' Government ', ' Industry ', ' Ligands ', ' Marketing ', ' Bicyclo(2.2.1)heptan-2-amine, N,2,3,3-tetramethyl- ', ' Mecamylamine ', ' Methods ', ' Narcanti ', ' Narcan ', ' Morphinan-6-one, 4,5-epoxy-3,14-dihydroxy-17-(2-propenyl)-, (5alpha)- ', ' Naloxone ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurobiology ', ' Pyridine, 3-(1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)-, (S)- ', ' Nicotine ', ' nicotine addiction ', ' Nicotine Dependence ', ' Nicotine Withdrawal ', ' Desmethylamitriptylin ', ' Desitriptyline ', ' 1-Propanamine, 3-(10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo(a,d)cyclohepten-5-ylidene)-N-methyl- ', ' Nortriptyline ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' research and development ', ' Rewards ', ' Science ', ' welfare ', ' Social Welfare ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' antianxiety agent ', ' Minor Tranquilizing Agents ', ' Anxiolytics ', ' Anxiolytic Agents ', ' Anti-Anxiety Drugs ', ' Anti-Anxiety Agents ', ' Moclobamide ', ' Benzamide, 4-Chloro-N-(2-(4-morpholinyl)ethyl)- ', ' Moclobemide ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' Bupropion ', ' buproprion ', ' Amfebutamone ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Series ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Stimulus ', ' Conditioned Stimulus ', ' Discipline ', ' Withdrawal ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Nicotinic Cholinergic Agonists ', ' Nicotinic Agonists ', ' gamma-Aminobutyric Acid Agonists ', ' GABA Receptor Agonists ', ' GABA Agonists ', ' Agonist ', ' Collaborations ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' Smoker ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' interest ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' receptor ', ' success ', ' trait ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' database management ', ' Data Base Management ', ' behavioral test ', ' behavior test ', ' nicotine abuse ', ' drug abuse nicotine ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Emotional ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Property ', ' drug development ', ' drug discovery ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Drug Dependency ', ' Drug Dependence ', ' Chemical Dependence ', ' Drug Addiction ', ' Academia ', ' Preclinical Models ', ' Pre-Clinical Model ', ' Preclinical Testing ', ' anti-smoking ', ' Antismoking ', ' Cognitive ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' varenicline ', ' Output ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' cost ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' clinical efficacy ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Affective ', ' addictive disorder ', ' addiction ', ' combat ', ' FDA approved ', ' efficacy testing ', ' public-private partnership ', ' screening ', ' ']",NIDA,"PSYCHOGENICS, INC.",R44,2015,915977,NJ-05,-0.017497446740159597
"Forecasting pulmonary inflammation from in vitro assay results for nanoparticles ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The rapidly developing field of nanotechnology shows promise by allowing designers to specifically select unique combinations of material properties as needed increasing the effectiveness of applications in medicine, coatings, lubrication, semiconductors, composites, and many others. These materials with their unique combinations of properties on exposure to humans may result in unanticipated hazards, however, putting workers in nanotechnology-related industries at risk. Traditional animal testing is expensive and too slow to evaluate potential risks for the current pace of new nanomaterial development. Both technology developers and regulators need more rapid methods to evaluate new nanomaterial configurations for their risk potential. Much hope is placed in high-throughput in vitro screening assays, but the relevance of these results to the potential for human disease or even the observed toxic effects in animal exposures is unclear. Some research has proposed Quantitative Structure Activity Relationships (QSARs) to predict in vitro nanomaterial toxicity in a few specific assays, but the applicability of these models to a wider group of materials, alternative in vitro assays, or in vivo toxicity has not been explored. If the primary exposure pathway for workers in the near term is inhalation, which in vitro assays will provide the most reliable risk information for that scenario? Two recently available data sources will permit this study to investigate this question: the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) ToxCast data for nanomaterials and the Nanomaterial Pulmonary Toxicity Database (NTDB), a collection of published peer reviewed studies observing pulmonary inflammation in rodents upon exposures to nanomaterials. This study will pursue the following specific aims: (1.) identify combinations of in vitro assay results that can reliably forecast the results of pulmonary inflammation results in rodents; (2.) evaluate whether existing proposed QSARs for nanomaterial toxicity apply to a wider array of in vitro toxicity assays; and (3.) evaluate whether existing proposed QSARs for nanomaterial toxicity apply to in vivo pulmonary inflammation results. This study will employ machine learning methods to cluster similar nanomaterials between the various in vitro and in vivo results, and to identify combinations of in vitro assays that rank order the toxicity of nanomaterials most similarly to pulmonary inflammation results in rodents considering also how changes in specific chemical and physical particle properties exacerbate or mitigate observed toxicity. This study addresses documented research needs in the National Occupational Research Agenda (NORA) cross- sector Nanotechnology program including specific goals in the Human Health and Informatics categories. Implementation complies with the Research to Practice (r2p) Initiative in its formulation, design, and implementation plan including industry an public outreach. The insight generated by this study will improve nanomaterial risk screening capabilities and focus attention and effort on those measurements and techniques proven to be most effective and reliable enabling better management and control of the risks faced by workers.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Although toxicity risk information for nanoparticles is accumulating rapidly, the development of new nanomaterial configurations is proceeding too fast for our best risk assessment tools (i.e. animal testing) to keep up. The new availability of two large databases of in vitro assay results and pulmonary inflammation results in rodents will permit this study to investigate which in vitro assays provide the most predictive information about the results from in vivo exposures, and thus speed up the risk screening process for nanomaterials. The results of this study will have important implications for more quickly identifying new nanomaterial-related risks to workers.            ",Forecasting pulmonary inflammation from in vitro assay results for nanoparticles,8953935,R03OH010956,[''],NIOSH,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R03,2015,66904,PA-12,0.0642844301074033
"Effectiveness of IG-IMRT for Locally Advanced Cervix Cancer on NRG Trial CVM-1421 ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cervical cancer is among the leading causes of cancer death worldwide. Patients often have poor access to screening and vaccination, and present in advanced stages, for which chemoradiotherapy (chemoRT) is the standard of care. This treatment is limited, however, by high rates of failure and toxicity. Although intensifying chemotherapy can improve tumor control and survival, toxicity is often unacceptably high. Strategies to reduce toxicity while increasing efficacy of chemoRT are therefore needed.  Standard pelvic RT techniques encompass large volumes of normal tissue. In contrast, image-guided intensity-modulated RT (IG-IMRT) is a modern technique that maximizes target dose and minimizes normal tissue dose. Multiple studies have found that IG-IMRT can significantly reduce organ dose and reduce toxicity compared to standard RT. These studies support the hypothesis that IG-IMRT can permit delivery of more intensive chemotherapy. For example, gemcitabine, a potent radiosensitizer, has been found to improve survival for cervical cancer patients in randomized trials (Dueñas-Gonzalez et al.). However, the toxicity when delivered with standard RT is extreme (>80% grade 3-4 toxicity). Therefore, this regimen has not replaced cisplatin alone as the standard of care. In contrast, our research group has found that the maximum tolerated dose of gemcitabine was increased when given with IG-IMRT. A large international multi-institutional trial has also found lower rates of toxicity with IG-IMRT compare to standard chemoRT. These findings support the hypothesis that IG-IMRT, by reducing bowel and bone marrow dose, could permit delivery of more effective concurrent chemotherapy. If confirmed, this would have significant implications for many pelvic malignancies. However, this hypothesis has not been tested in a randomized trial.  CVM-1421 is an emerging NCI-funded randomized phase II trial within the NRG Oncology Cooperative Group that will test the hypothesis that adding concurrent triapine, a ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor, to concurrent cisplatin and RT can improve outcomes in patients with locoregionally advanced cervix cancer undergoing definitive chemoradiation. This trial presents a unique opportunity to study the effects of IG- IMRT on normal tissue toxicity, as it will be the first cooperative group trial to permit IG-IMRT in this population. This trial also presents an opportunity to study ways to improve IG-IMRT quality, as there has been considerable controversy in how to optimally design IG-IMRT plans, due to their increased complexity. The goal of our research is to study the effect of IG-IMRT on toxicity, quality of life, and treatment outcomes, under varying intensities of chemotherapy. We will also implement a novel technique called knowledge-based planning (KBP) in order to improve plan quality and achieve optimal IG-IMRT dose distributions. This research could help establish IG-IMRT as a new standard of care for pelvic malignancies, and will lay groundwork for future studies testing novel technologies in clinical trial settings.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  In this study, we will test the hypothesis that image guided intensity modulated radiation therapy (IG-IMRT) will reduce hematologic and gastrointestinal toxicity compared to standard pelvic radiotherapy in cervical cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy and cisplatin with or without triapine. We are in an optimal situation to ask this question because the randomized phase II trial that will set the background for our study is evaluating the efficacy of more intensive chemotherapy while allowing both IG-IMRT and standard radiation treatment techniques. It would be beneficial for clinicians and patients to know whether IG-IMRT will reduce toxicity and improve quality of life.

"Novel Methodology for Identification of Senolytics that Reduce Age-related Disease and Dysfunction DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic diseases of aging account for a significant proportion of healthcare spending and result in a painful and limiting existence for many tens of millions of Americans and hundreds of millions of people around the world.

The platform consists of high content fluorescent image analysis using machine-learning algorithms to identify relevant and on-target changes induced in human cells in which diseases and treatments have been modeled. This system has been adapted to screen for drugs which may preferentially destroy senescent cells, as this may result in improved tissue function and decreases in pathology and mortality related to aging.

Progression to Phase II will depend on our ability to demonstrate the power of our morphological approach to identify senescent cells independent of any known senescent markers.  PHASE II Identify known drugs which preferentially destroy senescent cells, without affecting healthy cells, as identified by morphometric means.  Evaluate the efficacy of identified senolytic agents in a variety of tissue function and health-span models in mice. *Evaluate the effect of identified senolytic agents in a murine model of age-associated cardiovascular disease. Recursion Pharmaceuticals has the experience, tools, and drive to execute this Phase I/Phase II Fast-track SBIR proposal, and to accelerate commercial development of any compounds we identify as a result. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic diseases of aging affect a significant proportion of Americans. Cellular senescence, a useful biological program which prevents replication of cells exposed to various stresses that may be at risk of initiating tumors, has long-term deleterious inflammatory effects.

"High-throughput, all-optical assay in human cardiomyoctes for clinically relevant prediction of drug induced cardiotoxity. ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Toxicity accounts for approximately 20% of drug attrition, of which nearly one third is attributed to cardiovascular issues, in particular arrhythmias.1 The cost of bringing a new drug to market can exceed $1.2 billion and require more than 10 years of research. Thus, it is critical to identify cardiotoxicity early in developmen. Current in vitro screening assays for pro-­‐arrhythmic drug effects focus on measuring inhibition of the hERG potassium channel, which has been linked to potentially lethal Torsades de Pointes arrhythmias (TdP).2 The hERG assay, however, lacks high sensitivity and specificity: not all QT prolongation is due to block of hERG alone and not all hERG blockers result in QT prolongation or induce TdP. To address these limitations, regulatory bodies have created the Comprehensive in vitro Proarrhythmia Assay (CiPA) initiative2, which proposes use of cardiomyocytes derived from human stem cells as an in vitro model for arrhythmogenic drug potential. Establishment of this model for toxicity screening requires detailed characterization of the cardiomyocyte action potential (AP) and calcium transient (CT), the response of APs/CTs to drugs, and the correlation to clinical outcomes in humans. High-­‐throughput tools needed for performing these measurements, however, have been lacking. Here we propose to develop a high-­‐throughput, all-­‐optical electrophysiology platform for cardiotoxicity screening in sem cell-­‐derived cardiomyocytes. With our Phase I award, we demonstrated that the Optopatch platform could be used to detect changes in the electrophysiological characteristics of human derived CMs following both acute and chronic drug treatment, albeit with the throughput of a single well per recording. To highly parallelize these measurements, we propose building a 96-­‐well plate Optopatch instrument for simultaneous recording of voltage and calcium waveforms under paced conditions from 24 wells. This geometry will provide nearly two orders of magnitude improvement in throughput of our assay. Optopatch constructs will be optimized to allow for incorporation of the actuator and reporter proteins in each cell. We will utilize this platform to screen 50 compounds with known risk scores for Torsades de Pointes in different sources of human cardiomyocytes and use this data to develop a predictive algorithm of arrhythmogenicity.             PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Q­‐State's technology will allow better prediction of a drug candidate's potential adverse effects to the human heart than the assays mandated by the current cardiac safety guidance ICH S7B.   It will contribute to bringing effective healthcare solutions to market at lower cost and higher productivity, by preventing drugs with cardiotoxicity from reaching the market and preventing the development of valuable therapeutics from being wrongly terminated, which is one of the concerns about the current S7B assays. Making Q-­‐State instrumentation and reagents available to the academic research community will facilitate better mechanistic studies and therapeutics development to benefit patients with cardiac conditions.               ","High-throughput, all-optical assay in human cardiomyoctes for clinically relevant prediction of drug induced cardiotoxity.",9138354,R44HL126314,"['Accounting ', ' Action Potentials ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Algorithms ', ' Heart Arrhythmias ', ' Cardiac Arrhythmia ', ' Arrhythmia ', ' Award ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Life Sciences ', ' Bioscience ', ' Biologic Sciences ', ' Biological Sciences ', ' Factor IV ', ' Coagulation Factor IV ', ' Ca++ element ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor IV ', ' Calcium ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardio-vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Communities ', ' drug treatment ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Engineering ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Environmental Health ', ' Heart ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' In Vitro ', ' Institutes ', ' instrumentation ', ' Membrane Channels ', ' Ionic Channels ', ' Ion Channel ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Manuals ', ' Marketing ', ' optical ', ' Optics ', ' Paper ', ' Patients ', ' Potassium Ion Channels ', ' K channel ', ' Potassium Channel ', ' Production ', ' Productivity ', ' Proteins ', ' Reagent ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Computer Software Engineering ', ' Computer Software Development ', ' Software Engineering ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Torsades de Pointes ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' United States Food and Drug Administration ', ' USFDA ', ' Food and Drug Administration ', ' Vendor ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Blinded ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' cardiomyocyte ', ' Heart myocyte ', ' Heart Muscle Cells ', ' Cardiocyte ', ' Cardiac Muscle Cells ', ' Cardiac Myocytes ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Staging ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Contracts ', ' Reporter ', ' tool ', ' instrument ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Hour ', ' Frequencies ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Services ', ' success ', ' voltage ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' Human Nature ', ' Human Characteristics ', ' response ', ' Cardiotoxic ', ' Cardiac Toxicity ', ' Cardiotoxicity ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Adverse effects ', ' drug discovery ', ' patch clamp ', ' Provider ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' molecular signature ', ' molecular profile ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' Resolution ', ' in vitro Model ', ' Cell Maturation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Cardiac ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Phototoxicity ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' human stem cells ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new drugs ', ' new drug treatments ', ' induced pluripotent stem cell ', ' iPSCs ', ' iPSC ', ' iPS ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' therapeutic development ', ' public health relevance ', ' stem cell biology ', ' drug candidate ', ' phase 1 study ', ' Phase I Study ', ' optogenetics ', ' screening ', ' Geometry ', ' rate of change ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' ']",NHLBI,"Q-STATE BIOSCIENCES, INC.",R44,2016,602645,MA-07,0.04735353078705498
"Modelling Rett Syndrome in Vascularized Neural Assemblies DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal brings together leading experts in human pluripotent stem cell biology (Thomson), tissue engineering (Murphy), and machine learning (Page) to develop improved human cellular models for predicting developmental neural toxicity. Dramatic progress has been made in the derivation of many of the basic cellular components of the brain from human pluripotent stem cells (ES and iPS cells), but these advances have yet to be applied to predictive toxicology. The major components of the brain are derived from diverse embryological origins, including the neural plate (neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes), yolk sac myeloid progenitors (microglia), migratory mesodermal angioblasts (endothelial cells), and neural crest (vascular smooth muscle and pericytes). Because of their diverse origins, these components have very different inductive signaling histories. This means that deriving them all at once under the same conditions is not currently possible. For this reason, we will differentiate human pluripotent stem cells to early precursors of the major neural, glial, and vascular components of the cerebral cortex separately, cryopreserve the precursors, and subsequently combine them in 3D hydrogel assemblies to allow increased physiological interactions and maturation. Specifically, we will embed committed precursors for endothelial cells, pericytes, and microglia into hydrogels displaying combinations of peptide motifs that promote capillary network formation. We will then overlay this mesenchymal layer with neural and glial precursors to mimic the normal interactions between the cephalic mesenchyme and the neural epithelium, and promote the formation of the polarized layers of the cerebral cortex. After drug exposure, we will assess temporal changes in gene expression by these cerebral neural- vascular assemblies using highly multiplexed, deep RNA sequencing. Then, using safe drugs and known neural/developmental toxins from the NIH Clinical Collection, the University of Washington Teratogen Information System Database, and the EPA's Toxicity Reference Database as training sets, we will develop machine learning algorithms to predict neural toxicity of blinded drugs known to have failed in late stage animal testing or human clinical trials. This predictive, developmental neural toxicity model will be implemented on liquid handling robots and sequencers in widespread use, and will be readily adaptable to platforms being developed in complementary efforts by DARPA. The developmental potential of human pluripotent stem cells, the modular nature of the tunable hydrogels, and the discriminatory power of machine learning tools also makes the general approaches proposed readily applicable to predictive toxicity models for other tissue types throughout the body. This project will develop three-dimensional constructs of human neural tissue to better predict the neural toxicity of drugs prior to clinical trials. To accomplish this, experts in human pluripotent stem cell biology will grow the required neural components in the laboratory, experts in tissue engineers will assemble those cells into multicellular constructs, and experts in machine learning will use changes in gene expression after drug exposure to predict whether a test compound is toxic.",Modelling Rett Syndrome in Vascularized Neural Assemblies,9266143,UH3TR000506,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Algorithms ', ' astrocytic glia ', ' Astroglia ', ' Astrocytus ', ' Astrocytes ', ' vascular ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Capillaries ', ' Blood capillaries ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Cerebral cortex ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Drug toxicity ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Epithelium Part ', ' Epithelium ', ' Fetus ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Hedgehogs ', ' Erinaceidae ', ' histocompatibility typing ', ' Tissue Typing ', ' Tissue Crossmatching ', ' Histocompatibility Testing ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' Information Systems ', ' Laboratories ', ' Vascular Smooth Muscle ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Neural Crest ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' Oligodendroglia Cell ', ' Oligodendrocytus ', ' Oligodendrocytes ', ' Oligodendroglia ', ' Peptides ', ' Rett Disorder ', ' Cerebroatrophic Hyperammonemia ', ' Rett Syndrome ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Teratogens ', ' Testing ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Toxicology ', ' Toxin ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Yolk Sac ', ' vitelline sac ', ' notch protein ', ' notch receptors ', ' notch ', ' Mediating ', ' Blinded ', ' Mesenchyme ', ' Mesenchymas ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Cranial ', ' Cephalic ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' perivascular glial cell ', ' microgliocyte ', ' microglial cell ', ' mesoglia ', ' gitter cell ', ' Hortega cell ', ' Microglia ', ' Tyrosine Kinase Receptors ', ' Tyrosine Kinase Linked Receptors ', ' Transmembrane Receptor Protein Tyrosine Kinase ', ' Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Gene ', ' PTK Receptors ', ' Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases ', ' Training ', ' Endothelial Cells ', ' cerebral ', ' Cerebrum ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Human Figure ', ' Human body ', ' liquid ', ' fluid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' Exposure to ', ' Staging ', ' Robot ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Myeloid ', ' Myelogenous ', ' engineered tissue ', ' Tissue Engineering ', ' experience ', ' Rouget Cells ', ' Perivascular Cell ', ' Pericapillary Cell ', ' Adventitial Cell ', ' Pericytes ', ' toxicant ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Neural Development ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Hydrogels ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Drug Exposure ', ' Modeling ', ' prenatally exposed ', ' prenatal exposure ', ' Pluripotent Stem Cells ', ' drug development ', ' neural plate ', ' capillary ', ' cognitive change ', ' Animal Testing ', ' Mesenchymal ', ' molecular signature ', ' molecular profile ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' Angioblast ', ' Collection ', ' Rodent Model ', ' Derivation ', ' Derivation procedure ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' Population ', ' Cell model ', ' Cellular model ', ' progenitor ', ' induced pluripotent stem cell ', ' iPSCs ', ' iPSC ', ' iPS ', ' precursor cell ', ' stem cell biology ', ' in vitro testing ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' developmental toxicity ', ' ']",NCATS,"MORGRIDGE INSTITUTE FOR RESEARCH, INC.",UH3,2016,153000,WI-02,0.09293037812987441
"Repurposing pyronaridine as a treatment for the Ebola virus Summary In 2014, the outbreak of the Ebola virus (EBOV) in West Africa highlighted the need for broad-spectrum antiviral drugs for this and other emerging viruses. Several groups had previously performed high throughput screens in 2013 and identified FDA approved drugs (amodiaquine, chloroquine, clomiphene and toremifene) with in vitro growth inhibitory activities against EBOV. We used these compounds to create a computational pharmacophore to identify additional compounds to test in vitro. In addition, data from a published large scale high throughput screen performed by SRI International and Texas Biomedical Research Institute was used to create machine learning models and then subsequently used to score clinical compounds for testing. We have published on how these combined methods identified 3 compounds for testing which were ultimately found to be nM in vitro. One of these compounds is an antimalarial approved in Europe called pyronaridine. We propose to characterize the ADME and PK properties of this compound prior to determining its efficacy in a mouse model of the Ebola virus infection. Therefore the Aims of this R21 proposal will fill some of the gaps inherent in the published data on pyronaridine so far: Aim 1. Perform preclinical in vitro characterization of pyronaridine. Aim 2. Formulate pyronaridine and perform PK studies in mouse. Aim 3. In vitro characterization of pyronaridine against multiple EBOV strains and in vivo efficacy in the mouse model of Ebola virus infection. The results of these aims will determine go/no go criteria for pursuing larger animal studies in non-human primates prior to clinical studies. In the light of a recent paper in the New England Journal of Medicine showing a clinical observation that EBOV patients treated with artesunate-amodiaquine had a 31% higher survival rate than those treated with artemether- lumefantrine 2, there will be considerable interest in evaluating antimalarials against Ebola. Our proposal to consider testing the efficacy in the mouse EBOV model using pyronaridine (which is used as artesunate- pyronaridine (Pyramax) and would be readily accessible in the clinic), presents a rapid approach to leverage the aforementioned clinical observations with a more potent compound. Pyronaridine also has additional benefits of tolerability which may be important in this patient population. Narrative Preliminary clinical data showed that Ebola virus (EBOV) patients treated with the antimalarials artesunate- amodiaquine had a higher survival rate than those treated with artemether-lumefantrine, in agreement with the in vitro EC50 for amodiaquine EC50 of 2.6µM. The antimalarial pyronaridine, a structural analog of amodiaquine, was identified by a computational repurposing strategy and further shown to have an EC50 of 420 nM against EBOV in vitro. We now propose to fully characterize this compound using standard preclinical ADME assays prior to mouse pharmacokinetic analysis, determine broad-spectrum applicability against multiple EBOV strains and ultimately in vivo efficacy testing in the mouse Ebola virus model prior to testing in a non-human primate model. Our aim is to show whether Pyronaridine is a viable clinical candidate to treat patients infected with EBOV.",Repurposing pyronaridine as a treatment for the Ebola virus,9204673,R21TR001718,"['Africa ', ' Amodiaquin ', ' Amodiaquine ', ' Animals ', ' inhibitor ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' Antimalarial Drugs ', ' Antimalarial Agents ', ' Anti-Malarials ', ' Antimalarials ', ' Antivirals ', ' Antiviral Drugs ', ' Antiviral Agents ', ' Piroplasma ', ' Babesia ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Physiologic Availability ', ' Biologic Availability ', ' Bioavailability ', ' Biological Availability ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Mainland China ', ' China ', ' Khingamin ', ' Chlorochin ', ' Chloroquine ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Chloramiphene ', ' Clomiphene ', ' Control Groups ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Outbreaks ', ' Disease Outbreaks ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Ebola ', ' Ebola virus ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Enzymes ', ' blood corpuscles ', ' Red blood corpuscule ', ' Red Cell ', ' Red Blood Cells ', ' Marrow erythrocyte ', ' Erythrocytic ', ' Erythrocytes Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood normocyte ', ' Blood erythrocyte ', ' Erythrocytes ', ' Europe ', ' Family ', ' Female ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Half-Life ', ' In Vitro ', ' Infection ', ' bowel ', ' Intestinal ', ' Intestines ', ' LD50 ', ' LD-50 ', ' Lethal Dose 50 ', ' Libraries ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' hepatic body system ', ' Liver ', ' Plasmodium Infections ', ' Paludism ', ' Malaria ', ' Plasmodium vivax Malaria ', ' Vivax Malaria ', ' male ', ' Mannich Bases ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' Northeastern United States ', ' New England ', ' Paper ', ' Patients ', ' Permeability ', ' Pharmacokinetics ', ' Drug Kinetics ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma ', ' Plasma Proteins ', ' P.falciparum ', ' P. falciparum ', ' Plasmodium falciparum ', ' P. vivax ', ' Plasmodium vivax ', ' Publishing ', ' Research Institute ', ' Solubility ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Testing ', ' Texas ', ' Time ', ' Trypanosoma cruzi ', ' T. cruzi ', ' American trypanosome ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' virus infection ', ' viral infection ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' Virus Inhibitors ', ' viral inhibitor ', ' Virus ', ' General Viruses ', ' Body Weight decreased ', ' wt-loss ', ' body weight loss ', ' Weight Reduction ', ' Weight Loss ', ' artemether ', ' O-methyldihydroartemisinine ', ' artesunate ', ' pyronaridine ', ' Toremifene ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Journals ', ' Magazine ', ' base ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Filovirus ', ' Ensure ', ' non-human primate ', ' nonhuman primate ', ' European ', ' Protein Binding ', ' Ligand Binding Protein Gene ', ' Ligand Binding Protein ', ' Binding Proteins ', ' analog ', ' Staging ', ' Whole Blood ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Hour ', ' Oral ', ' Clinic ', ' treatment days ', ' Treatment Period ', ' treatment duration ', ' Route ', ' Techniques ', ' lumefantrine ', ' benflumetol ', ' interest ', ' pharmacophore ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' Animal Model ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Agreement ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' High Throughput Assay ', ' high throughput screening ', ' Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Dose ', ' Bolus ', ' Bolus Infusion ', ' Data ', ' Natural Product Drug ', ' International ', ' in vivo ', ' Clinical Data ', ' clinical test ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Monitor ', ' Behavioral ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' pre-clinical study ', ' preclinical study ', ' PubChem ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' resistant to chloroquine ', ' resistance to chloroquine ', ' chloroquine resistant ', ' Chloroquine resistance ', ' neurotoxicity ', ' neuronal toxicity ', ' neuron toxicity ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new drugs ', ' new drug treatments ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' FDA approved ', ' patient population ', ' in vitro testing ', ' efficacy testing ', ' Formulation ', ' bioactive natural products ', ' ']",NCATS,"COLLABORATIONS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.",R21,2016,288801,NC-02,0.09810365180202549
"Forecasting pulmonary inflammation from in vitro assay results for nanoparticles ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The rapidly developing field of nanotechnology shows promise by allowing designers to specifically select unique combinations of material properties as needed increasing the effectiveness of applications in medicine, coatings, lubrication, semiconductors, composites, and many others. These materials with their unique combinations of properties on exposure to humans may result in unanticipated hazards, however, putting workers in nanotechnology-related industries at risk. Traditional animal testing is expensive and too slow to evaluate potential risks for the current pace of new nanomaterial development. Both technology developers and regulators need more rapid methods to evaluate new nanomaterial configurations for their risk potential. Much hope is placed in high-throughput in vitro screening assays, but the relevance of these results to the potential for human disease or even the observed toxic effects in animal exposures is unclear. Some research has proposed Quantitative Structure Activity Relationships (QSARs) to predict in vitro nanomaterial toxicity in a few specific assays, but the applicability of these models to a wider group of materials, alternative in vitro assays, or in vivo toxicity has not been explored. If the primary exposure pathway for workers in the near term is inhalation, which in vitro assays will provide the most reliable risk information for that scenario? Two recently available data sources will permit this study to investigate this question: the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) ToxCast data for nanomaterials and the Nanomaterial Pulmonary Toxicity Database (NTDB), a collection of published peer reviewed studies observing pulmonary inflammation in rodents upon exposures to nanomaterials. This study will pursue the following specific aims: (1.) identify combinations of in vitro assay results that can reliably forecast the results of pulmonary inflammation results in rodents; (2.) evaluate whether existing proposed QSARs for nanomaterial toxicity apply to a wider array of in vitro toxicity assays; and (3.) evaluate whether existing proposed QSARs for nanomaterial toxicity apply to in vivo pulmonary inflammation results. This study will employ machine learning methods to cluster similar nanomaterials between the various in vitro and in vivo results, and to identify combinations of in vitro assays that rank order the toxicity of nanomaterials most similarly to pulmonary inflammation results in rodents considering also how changes in specific chemical and physical particle properties exacerbate or mitigate observed toxicity. This study addresses documented research needs in the National Occupational Research Agenda (NORA) cross- sector Nanotechnology program including specific goals in the Human Health and Informatics categories. Implementation complies with the Research to Practice (r2p) Initiative in its formulation, design, and implementation plan including industry an public outreach. The insight generated by this study will improve nanomaterial risk screening capabilities and focus attention and effort on those measurements and techniques proven to be most effective and reliable enabling better management and control of the risks faced by workers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Although toxicity risk information for nanoparticles is accumulating rapidly, the development of new nanomaterial configurations is proceeding too fast for our best risk assessment tools (i.e. animal testing) to keep up. The new availability of two large databases of in vitro assay results and pulmonary inflammation results in rodents will permit this study to investigate which in vitro assays provide the most predictive information about the results from in vivo exposures, and thus speed up the risk screening process for nanomaterials. The results of this study will have important implications for more quickly identifying new nanomaterial-related risks to workers.",Forecasting pulmonary inflammation from in vitro assay results for nanoparticles,9144793,R03OH010956,[''],NIOSH,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R03,2016,66564,PA-12,0.0642844301074033
"Development of integrative models for early liver toxicity assessment ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Computational toxicology has become a critical area of research due to the burgeoning need to evaluate thousands of pharmaceutical and environmental chemicals with unknown toxicity profiles, the high demand in time and resources by current experimental toxicity testing, and the growing ethical concerns over animal use in toxicity studies. Despite tremendous efforts, little success has been attained thus far in the development of predictive computational models for toxicity, primarily due to the complexity of toxicity mechanisms as well as the lack of high-quality experimental data for model development.  A critical challenge in toxicity testing of chemicals is that toxicity effects are doe-dependent: the true toxic hits may show no toxicity at all at low dose level. Therefore, traditiona high-throughput screening (HTS) that test chemicals only at a single concentration is not suitable for toxicity screening. On the contrary, the recently developed quantitative high-throughput screening (qHTS) platforms can evaluate each chemical across a broad range of concentrations, and is gaining ever-increasing popularity as a tool for in vitro toxicity profiling The concentration-response information generated by qHTS are expected to provide more accurate and comprehensive information of the toxicity effects of chemicals, offering promising data that can be mined to estimate in vivo toxicities of chemicals. However, our previous studies showed that if processed inappropriately, such concentration-response information contribute little to improve the toxicity prediction. This is especially true when multiple types of qHTS data are used together. Therefore, in this study, we will extend our previous approaches to develop novel statistical and computational tools that can curate, preprocess, and normalize the concentration-response information from multiple different qHTS databases.  Traditionally, toxicity models are based on either the chemical data (such as the quantitative structure- activity relationship analysis), or the in vitro toxicity profiling data (such as the in vitro-in vivo extrapolations). Our previous experiences suggested that integrating biological descriptors such as the in vitro cytotoxicity profiles or the short-term toxigenomic data, with chemical structural features is able to predict rodent acute liver toxicity with reasonable accuracy. Therefore, the second part of this proposal will be devoted to develop novel computational models for hepatotoxicity prediction by integrating qHTS toxicity profiles and chemical structural information In Aim 1, we will curate, preprocess, and normalize collected public liver toxicity datasets. In ths study, we will model toxicity effects using multiple large public datasets such as HTS and qHTS bioassay data (Tox21[1] and ToxCast[2]), hepatotoxicity side effect reports on marketed failed drugs[3], the Liver Toxicity Knowledge Base Benchmark Dataset (LTKB-BD[4]), etc. Statistical methods for cross-study validation and quality control will be applied to the collected datasets to ensure computational compatibility and to select the appropriate datasets for analysis. In Aim 2, we will develop predictive models for chemicals' liver toxicity based on an integrative modeling workflow that will make use of both structural and in vitro toxicity profiles of a chemical. Our previous studies [5] showed that models using both in vitro toxicity profiles and chemical structural data have better accuracy for rodent acute liver toxicity than models using either data type alone. Here, we will develop a novel modeling workflow that start with defining the functional clusters of chemicals via curated qHTS toxicity profiles, and is followed by developing computational models to correlate chemical and biological data with overall toxicity risks in humans. The predictive models will be validated using independent datasets with over 800 compounds. In Aim 3, we propose to prioritize the qHTS profiling assays used in the model for future toxicity testing. We will evaluate all the in vitro assays as biological descriptors from thee perspectives, including descriptor importance in the integrative toxicity model, correlation with i vivo DILI outcomes, and level of information content estimated by a novel approach based on network analysis.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this study we aim to develop computational models that can identify potential liver toxicants. Liver toxicity is a significant contributor to the high attition rate in drug development. Moreover, toxic chemicals in food, water, and consumer products all pose serious risks for liver toxicity. As a result, there is great interest in developing high-throughput, high-content experimental and computational tools to evaluate the liver toxicity of thousands of pharmaceutical and environmental chemicals. This study focuses on developing novel informatics tools that enable the extraction and integration of chemical concentration-response information from multiple quantitative high-throughput screening databases for model development, and developing statistical models that are able to integrate this concentration-response information with chemical structural features to predict their risk of liver toxicity.

"Optimization of small molecule triazine antituberculars for in vivo efficacy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tuberculosis (TB) is due to infection with the pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). This disease represents a global health pandemic as based on WHO statistics it claims the lives of approximately 1.5 million people per year, while infecting nearly 9 million. New drugs are urgently needed with novel mechanisms of action that treat this disease while also addressing an important need to reduce the lengthy course of treatment that is at best 6 months in duration. We have a primary goal of discovering novel classes of antibacterials. (E)-6-(2-((5-nitrofuran-2-yl)methylene)hydrazinyl)-N2,N4-diphenyl-1,3,5-triazine-2,4-diamine (JSF-2019) [1], was rediscovered by us using Bayesian machine learning models in 2013. It represents a class of antitubercular agents reported only once in 1969 [2]. While JSF-2019 did not exhibit in vivo efficacy in an acute model in our hands, a close analog, ((E)-N2,N4-diisopropyl-6-(2-((5-nitrofuran-2-yl)methylene)hydrazinyl)- 1,3,5-triazine-2,4-diamine (JSF-2032) [2] was reported in 1969 to exhibit in vivo activity. Our preliminary data on solubility in PBS, mouse liver microsomal stability, Caco-2 cell permeability, and mouse snapshot pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles demonstrate that the diaminotriazine class of antituberculars holds significant promise for seeding a novel therapeutic. We aim to further improve upon the in vitro efficacy, in vitro Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism and Excretion (ADME) and in vivo pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of these early compounds. The Specific Aims of this proposed research are: Utilize medicinal chemistry and predictive ADME models to optimize the initial triazine hit family as antitubercular agents. Apply transcriptional profiling nd resistant mutant/whole-genome sequencing methods to identify potential drug targets and mechanism of action of the triazine antitubercular class. Phase I would, therefore, seek to deliver an in vivo active small molecule triazine with information as to potential target/s through complimentary methods. A Phase II program would leverage this information to further optimize this series towards a preclinical candidate of significant interest to foundations and/or biotech/pharmaceutical companies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Tuberculosis represents a global health pandemic, which claims the lives of approximately 1.5 million people per year. Starting from a series of triazines active compounds we will optimize ADME properties to afford a novel in vivo active lead compound by combining our unique expertise in medicinal chemistry and predictive ADME models. We will also probe the potential target/s of the triazine series. We will further leverage the exceptional facilities at Rutgers to ultimately lead to a clinical candidate by the end of phas II.",Optimization of small molecule triazine antituberculars for in vivo

"Retinal tissue chips for ocular disease modeling DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal brings together leading experts in human pluripotent stem cell biology (Thomson), tissue engineering (Murphy), and machine learning (Page) to develop improved human cellular models for predicting developmental neural toxicity. Dramatic progress has been made in the derivation of many of the basic cellular components of the brain from human pluripotent stem cells (ES and iPS cells), but these advances have yet to be applied to predictive toxicology. The major components of the brain are derived from diverse embryological origins, including the neural plate (neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes), yolk sac myeloid progenitors (microglia), migratory mesodermal angioblasts (endothelial cells), and neural crest (vascular smooth muscle and pericytes). Because of their diverse origins, these components have very different inductive signaling histories. This means that deriving them all at once under the same conditions is not currently possible. For this reason, we will differentiate human pluripotent stem cells to early precursors of the major neural, glial, and vascular components of the cerebral cortex separately, cryopreserve the precursors, and subsequently combine them in 3D hydrogel assemblies to allow increased physiological interactions and maturation. Specifically, we will embed committed precursors for endothelial cells, pericytes, and microglia into hydrogels displaying combinations of peptide motifs that promote capillary network formation. We will then overlay this mesenchymal layer with neural and glial precursors to mimic the normal interactions between the cephalic mesenchyme and the neural epithelium, and promote the formation of the polarized layers of the cerebral cortex. After drug exposure, we will assess temporal changes in gene expression by these cerebral neural- vascular assemblies using highly multiplexed, deep RNA sequencing. Then, using safe drugs and known neural/developmental toxins from the NIH Clinical Collection, the University of Washington Teratogen Information System Database, and the EPA's Toxicity Reference Database as training sets, we will develop machine learning algorithms to predict neural toxicity of blinded drugs known to have failed in late stage animal testing or human clinical trials. This predictive, developmental neural toxicity model will be implemented on liquid handling robots and sequencers in widespread use, and will be readily adaptable to platforms being developed in complementary efforts by DARPA. The developmental potential of human pluripotent stem cells, the modular nature of the tunable hydrogels, and the discriminatory power of machine learning tools also makes the general approaches proposed readily applicable to predictive toxicity models for other tissue types throughout the body. This project will develop three-dimensional constructs of human neural tissue to better predict the neural toxicity of drugs prior to clinical trials. To accomplish this, experts in human pluripotent stem cell biology will grow the required neural components in the laboratory, experts in tissue engineers will assemble those cells into multicellular constructs, and experts in machine learning will use changes in gene expression after drug exposure to predict whether a test compound is toxic.",Retinal tissue chips for ocular disease modeling,9266174,UH3TR000506,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Algorithms ', ' astrocytic glia ', ' Astroglia ', ' Astrocytus ', ' Astrocytes ', ' vascular ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Capillaries ', ' Blood capillaries ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Cerebral cortex ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Drug toxicity ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Epithelium Part ', ' Epithelium ', ' Fetus ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Hedgehogs ', ' Erinaceidae ', ' histocompatibility typing ', ' Tissue Typing ', ' Tissue Crossmatching ', ' Histocompatibility Testing ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' Information Systems ', ' Laboratories ', ' Vascular Smooth Muscle ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Neural Crest ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' Oligodendroglia Cell ', ' Oligodendrocytus ', ' Oligodendrocytes ', ' Oligodendroglia ', ' Peptides ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Teratogens ', ' Testing ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Toxicology ', ' Toxin ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Yolk Sac ', ' vitelline sac ', ' notch protein ', ' notch receptors ', ' notch ', ' Mediating ', ' Blinded ', ' Mesenchyme ', ' Mesenchymas ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Cranial ', ' Cephalic ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' perivascular glial cell ', ' microgliocyte ', ' microglial cell ', ' mesoglia ', ' gitter cell ', ' Hortega cell ', ' Microglia ', ' Tyrosine Kinase Receptors ', ' Tyrosine Kinase Linked Receptors ', ' Transmembrane Receptor Protein Tyrosine Kinase ', ' Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Gene ', ' PTK Receptors ', ' Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases ', ' Training ', ' Endothelial Cells ', ' cerebral ', ' Cerebrum ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Human Figure ', ' Human body ', ' liquid ', ' fluid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' Exposure to ', ' Staging ', ' Robot ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Myeloid ', ' Myelogenous ', ' engineered tissue ', ' Tissue Engineering ', ' experience ', ' Rouget Cells ', ' Perivascular Cell ', ' Pericapillary Cell ', ' Adventitial Cell ', ' Pericytes ', ' toxicant ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Neural Development ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Hydrogels ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' disorder model ', ' Disease model ', ' Drug Exposure ', ' Modeling ', ' prenatally exposed ', ' prenatal exposure ', ' Pluripotent Stem Cells ', ' drug development ', ' neural plate ', ' capillary ', ' cognitive change ', ' Animal Testing ', ' Mesenchymal ', ' molecular signature ', ' molecular profile ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' Angioblast ', ' Collection ', ' Rodent Model ', ' Tissue Chip ', ' Tissue Arrays ', ' Tissue Microarray ', ' Derivation ', ' Derivation procedure ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Retinal ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' Population ', ' Cell model ', ' Cellular model ', ' progenitor ', ' induced pluripotent stem cell ', ' iPSCs ', ' iPSC ', ' iPS ', ' precursor cell ', ' stem cell biology ', ' in vitro testing ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' developmental toxicity ', ' ']",NCATS,"MORGRIDGE INSTITUTE FOR RESEARCH, INC.",UH3,2016,76500,WI-02,0.09447148683033157

"Centralized assay datasets for modelling support of small drug discovery organizations Summary The objective of ‘Assay Central’ is to compile a comprehensive collection of datasets for structure-activity data for a broad variety of disease targets and absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicology (ADMET) properties, in a form that is immediately ready for model building and other forms of analysis using cheminformatics methods. This is aided by the existence of many sources of curated open data, and one in particular, ChEMBL 1, 2 will be used as the nucleus in Phase I. This bioassay data collection is incredibly valuable, but not currently provided in a form that is ready-to-go for use by small research and development (R&D) organisations that do not have their own in-house cheminformatics teams. The effort required to preprocess, filter, merge, validate and normalize the structure and activity data requires a great deal of software expertise and medicinal chemistry domain knowledge, which are key skillsets that are rare and expensive to combine within the same team. Create a script to analyze the databases like ChEMBL, selected parts of PubChem and others 1, 2 and partition it into groups of compatible activity measurements against the same target. We will seed the dataset collection with a set of 1840 target-assay groups that have been recently extracted from the ChEMBL v20 database, as well as EPA Tox21 measurements 3, using methodology that we have already developed (similar to that described in 4). We will build error checking and correction software. We will apply best-of-breed methodology for checking and correcting structure-activity data 5 which errs on the side of caution for problems with non- obvious solutions, so that we can manually identify problems and either apply patches, or datasource-specific automated corrections. We will build and validate Bayesian models with the datasets collected and cleaned. For each of the target-activity groups, we will create a Bayesian model using ECFP6 or FCFP6 fingerprints, and this will be one of the primary outputs from the project. Models will be evaluated using internal and external testing with receiver operator characteristic (ROC > 0.75), the integral of the true-negative-rate – true-positive-rate curve as well as the enrichment,6 Kappa value and positive predicted value.7 We will develop new data visualization tools as a proof of concept in phase I. We have already begun to explore preliminary visualization methods using multiple models, but these have so far focused primarily on a handful of machine learning models selected from a very large list. New visualization techniques are required to summarize large matrices of data, e.g. a list of proposed structures vs. thousands of target models. In Phase II we will expand by upgrading to newer ChEMBL releases, selectively incorporating screening runs from other databases (such as PubChem 8), These tools will consist of software created explicitly for this project (particularly web-based interfaces), as well as enhanced functionality added to 3rd party tools that we influence (e.g. mobile apps) and open source projects that we have already contributed to (e.g. CDK for fingerprints and Bayesian modelling). We will widely publicise Assay Central at conferences and in papers. Being able to use transparent computational models simultaneously for visualizing activity trends for multiple targets (both diseases and ADMET) removes the burden of curation or purchasing and maintaining expensive software, and drastically simplifies the addition of new data. It also represents a new frontier of drug discovery as a world of small, agile distributed R&D organizations has access to valuable public datasets that can inform their research. Such computational models will assist in drug repurposing efforts internally and with our collaborators while likely identifying new compounds for a wide array of drug discovery projects. Narrative There are massive publically accessible databases that include a broad variety of disease targets and absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicology (ADMET) properties that are not a form that is immediately ready for machine learning model building. The ‘Assay Central’ project will compile a comprehensive collection of these datasets (from PubChem and ChEMBL) for structure-activity data. This will enable the user to quickly and automatically use machine learning models for various targets and properties.

Patients often have poor access to screening and vaccination, and present in advanced stages, for which chemoradiotherapy (chemoRT) is the standard of care. This treatment is limited, however, by high rates of failure and toxicity. Although intensifying chemotherapy can improve tumor control and survival, toxicity is often unacceptably high. Strategies to reduce toxicity while increasing efficacy of chemoRT are therefore needed.  Standard pelvic RT techniques encompass large volumes of normal tissue. In contrast, image-guided intensity-modulated RT (IG-IMRT) is a modern technique that maximizes target dose and minimizes normal tissue dose. Multiple studies have found that IG-IMRT can significantly reduce organ dose and reduce toxicity compared to standard RT. These studies support the hypothesis that IG-IMRT can permit delivery of more intensive chemotherapy. For example, gemcitabine, a potent radiosensitizer, has been found to improve survival for cervical cancer patients in randomized trials (Dueñas-Gonzalez et al.). However, the toxicity when delivered with standard RT is extreme (>80% grade 3-4 toxicity). Therefore, this regimen has not replaced cisplatin alone as the standard of care. In contrast, our research group has found that the maximum tolerated dose of gemcitabine was increased when given with IG-IMRT. A large international multi-institutional trial has also found lower rates of toxicity with IG-IMRT compare to standard chemoRT. These findings support the hypothesis that IG-IMRT, by reducing bowel and bone marrow dose, could permit delivery of more effective concurrent chemotherapy. If confirmed, this would have significant implications for many pelvic malignancies. However, this hypothesis has not been tested in a randomized trial.  CVM-1421 is an emerging NCI-funded randomized phase II trial within the NRG Oncology Cooperative Group that will test the hypothesis that adding concurrent triapine, a ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor, to concurrent cisplatin and RT can improve outcomes in patients with locoregionally advanced cervix cancer undergoing definitive chemoradiation. This trial presents a unique opportunity to study the effects of IG- IMRT on normal tissue toxicity, as it will be the first cooperative group trial to permit IG-IMRT in this population. This trial also presents an opportunity to study ways to improve IG-IMRT quality, as there has been considerable controversy in how to optimally design IG-IMRT plans, due to their increased complexity. The goal of our research is to study the effect of IG-IMRT on toxicity, quality of life, and treatment outcomes, under varying intensities of chemotherapy. We will also implement a novel technique called knowledge-based planning (KBP) in order to improve plan quality and achieve optimal IG-IMRT dose distributions. This research could help establish IG-IMRT as a new standard of care for pelvic malignancies, and will lay groundwork for future studies testing novel technologies in clinical trial settings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  In this study, we will test the hypothesis that image guided intensity modulated radiation therapy (IG-IMRT) will reduce hematologic and gastrointestinal toxicity compared to standard pelvic radiotherapy in cervical cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy and cisplatin with or without triapine. We are in an optimal situation to ask this question because the randomized phase II trial that will set the background for our study is evaluating the efficacy of more intensive chemotherapy while allowing both IG-IMRT and standard radiation treatment techniques. It would be beneficial for clinicians and patients to know whether IG-IMRT will reduce toxicity and improve quality of life. Further, this study could help establish IG-IMRT as a new standard of care.",Effectiveness of IG-IMRT for Locally Advanced Cervix Cancer on NRG Trial CVM-1421,9301295,R01CA197059,"['Bone Marrow Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Bone Marrow ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' cis-Platinum ', ' cis-Dichlorodiammineplatinum(II) ', ' cis-Diamminedichloroplatinum(II) ', ' cis-Diamminedichloroplatinum ', ' cis-Diaminedichloroplatinum ', ' cis platinum compound ', ' cis dichlorodiammineplatinum ', ' Platinum Diamminodichloride ', "" Peyrone's Salt "", "" Peyrone's Chloride "", ' Dichlorodiammineplatinum ', ' Cysplatyna ', ' Cisplatinum ', ' Cisplatina ', ' Cis-platinum II Diamine Dichloride ', ' Cis-platinum II ', ' Cis-platinous Diamine Dichloride ', ' Cis-dichloroammine Platinum (II) ', ' Cis-diamminedichloro Platinum (II) ', ' Cis-diamminedichloridoplatinum ', ' Cis-diammine-dichloroplatinum ', ' CDDP ', ' Cisplatin ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Gynecology ', ' Intestines ', ' bowel ', ' Intestinal ', ' Modernization ', ' Patients ', ' Pelvis ', ' Pelvic Region ', ' Pelvic ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' radiation effect ', ' Radiation-Sensitizing Agents ', ' radiosensitizer ', ' Radiosensitizing Drugs ', ' Radiosensitizing Agents ', ' Radiation-Sensitizing Drugs ', ' Radiation Sensitizers ', ' Radiation therapy ', ' treatment with radiation ', ' radio-therapy ', ' radiation treatment ', ' Radiotherapy ', ' Radiotherapeutics ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Urogenital System ', ' Urogenital ', ' Genitourinary ', ' Genitourinary system ', ' Vaccination ', ' dFdCyd ', ' dFdC ', ' Difluorodeoxycytidine ', ' gemcitabine ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Secondary to ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Lateral ', ' Anterior ', ' Gynecologic ', ' Failure ', ' Progression-Free Survivals ', ' Funding ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' oncology ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Normal tissue morphology ', ' Normal Tissue ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' DNA Synthesis Inhibitors ', ' chemoradiation ', ' radiochemotherapy ', ' radio-chemotherapy ', ' radio-chemo-therapy ', ' chemoradiotherapy ', ' chemo-radiotherapy ', ' chemo-radio-therapy ', ' chemo-/radio-therapy ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Techniques ', ' gastrointestinal ', ' interest ', ' American ', ' knowledge base ', ' knowledgebase ', ' treatment planning ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Toxicities ', ' novel ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' Maximum Tolerated Dose ', ' Maximally Tolerated Dose ', ' Maximal Tolerated Dose ', ' Radiation ', ' Modeling ', ' Triapine ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Ribonucleotide Reductase Inhibitor ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy ', ' Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy ', ' Intensity Modulated RT ', ' IMRT ', ' International ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' chemotherapy ', ' comparative effectiveness ', ' tumor ', ' public health relevance ', ' standard of care ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' Regimen ', ' screening ', ' phase II trial ', ' phase I trial ', ' image guided ', ' image guidance ', ' contrast imaging ', ' improved outcome ', ' ']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2017,217388,CA-52,0.07134171216308155
"Repurposing pyronaridine as a treatment for Chagas disease Summary Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are a diverse group of diseases with distinct characteristics that thrive mainly among the poorest populations of the world. There are 17 NTDs prioritized by the World Health Organization which are endemic in 149 countries and affect more than 1.4 billion people globally, which costs these developing economies billions of dollars annually. The neglected tropical diseases result from four different causative pathogens: protozoa, bacteria, helminth and virus. The majority of the diseases lack effective treatments. For example, 6 to 7 million people in Latin America are infected with the eukaryotic parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease. This disease is gaining recognition as an emerging infection in the United States where an estimated 300,000 people may be infected. Chagas disease has a serious economic impact on the United States and the world. The cost of treatment in the United States alone, where the disease is not indigenous, is estimated to be $900 million annually, which includes hospitalization and medical devices such as pacemakers. The global cost is estimated at $7 billion. Unfortunately, there are no FDA approved treatments for Chagas disease and the two available treatments used outside the U.S. have toxic side effects. New therapeutics for Chagas disease and the other NTDs are desperately needed. Using a machine learning model based on published data for compounds tested against T. cruzi we have identified the EU-approved antimalarial pyronaridine as particularly active in vitro and in vivo with statistically significant efficacy in a 4-day mouse model of infection with a T. cruzi strain expressing firefly luciferase. Pyronaridine demonstrated 85.2% parasite reduction after 4 days treatment, and is known to have a long half-life in humans (13.2 days), promising toxicity profile (less toxic than chloroquine in malaria treatment) and may suggest a drug repurposing opportunity for further study. We propose in this project to determine the minimum effective dose (treatment regimen) for pyronaridine in the acute model of Chagas disease. We will also determine efficacy in the chronic phase of Chagas disease (sterile cure). We will pursue combination therapy DMPK profiling as well as performing combination therapy in vivo efficacy in chronic model of Chagas disease. The results will enable us to assess whether this EU approved drug is worthy of a clinical trial for Chagas disease in the UH3 stage. If successful we will design a clinical study and recruit patients for a phase II trial. This grant represents a unique opportunity to partner the Center for Discovery and Innovation in Parasitic Diseases (www.cdipd.org) at UCSD and the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil with Collaborations Pharmaceuticals Inc. Narrative Approximately 6 to 7 million people in Latin America are infected with the eukaryotic parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of the deadly Chagas disease. This disease is gaining recognition as an emerging infection in the United States where an estimated 300,000 people may be infected and there is no FDA approved treatment. The antimalarial pyronaridine was recently identified by our groups using computational Bayesian repurposing methods and was confirmed as active when tested in vitro and in vivo in the acute mouse model of Chagas disease. We now propose in the UH2 stage to determine: the minimum effective dose in the acute model of Chagas disease and efficacy in the chronic phase while also assessing potential for combination therapy.

"Biocomputation across distributed private datasets to enhance drug discovery Project Summary Collaborative Drug Discovery (CDD) proposes to develop technology that will vastly simplify and integrate all the processes required to exploit predictive models for drug discovery. The software will make it easy for scientists without specialized training in informatics to create, train, apply, evaluate, share, and archive models with minimal effort, and also leverage a large library of pre-computed models with zero effort. The software will also enable scientists working in different organizations to collectively build models from their aggregated data and share these models, without sharing the underlying training data.  Our goal is to democratize the role in drug discovery of computational models – which have historically been restricted to computational experts – and allow models to become routine aids to the discovery workflow in academia, foundations, government laboratories, and small companies that do not have the resources to employ them today. In Phase 2 we implemented modified Bayesian model building directly within CDD’s web- based CDD Vault platform, which securely hosts structure-activity relationship (SAR) data; any user can now easily train a Bayesian model with experimental data stored in her private Vault, then apply the model to predict activity for untested compounds. In Phase 2B we propose to generalize this capability with the following new Specific Aims, which are needed to achieve a widespread scientific and commercial impact: Aim 1: Integrate a suite of diverse computational techniques (such as QSAR, Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbors, and possibly others) into a single framework, to allow direct side-by-side comparison. Aim 2: Develop and validate a universal metric that ranks the predictive strength of each method as applied to a particular dataset. Aim 3: Apply the metric to automatically generate thousands of models from high-quality, public-access structure-activity and ADME/Tox datasets and present key results to the user. Aim 4: Develop a novel capability to build models collaboratively, by aggregating multiple datasets, and share the models without revealing the compounds and data in the training sets. Project Narrative The proposed project will create novel computational tools that will help researchers to accelerate the discovery of new and improved drugs against a wide range of diseases. These tools will particularly benefit researchers working on diseases that leading pharmaceutical companies have largely ignored because they are not perceived as highly profitable opportunities, despite the fact that in many cases they afflict millions of people.",Biocomputation across distributed private datasets to enhance drug discovery,9345057,R44TR000942,"['Algorithms ', ' Archives ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Mental Confusion ', ' Confusional State ', ' Confusion ', ' P450 ', ' Cytochrome P450 Family Gene ', ' Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System ', ' Cytochrome P-450 ', ' Cytochrome P450 ', ' Aggregated Data ', ' Data Aggregation ', ' Data Sources ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Laboratories ', ' Libraries ', ' Methods ', ' Online Systems ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Privatization ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Structure-Activity Relationship ', ' structure function relationship ', ' chemical structure function ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' forest ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Visualization ', ' Imagery ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Trust ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Side ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' success ', ' Biological Neural Networks ', ' neural network ', ' Informatics ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Toxicities ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Modeling ', ' Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship ', ' Quantitiative Structure Activity Relationship ', ' QSAR ', ' drug discovery ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Academia ', ' Data ', ' Computational Technique ', ' Update ', ' Process ', ' Output ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' open source ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new drugs ', ' new drug treatments ', ' Secure ', ' Bayesian Modeling ', ' Bayesian tracking algorithms ', ' Bayesian statistical models ', ' Bayesian spatial models ', ' Bayesian spatial image models ', ' Bayesian spatial data model ', ' Bayesian nonparametric models ', ' Bayesian network model ', ' Bayesian hierarchical model ', ' Bayesian framework ', ' Bayesian belief updating model ', ' Bayesian belief network ', ' Bayesian adaptive models ', ' Bayesian adaptive designs ', ' model building ', ' ']",NCATS,"COLLABORATIVE DRUG DISCOVERY, INC.",R44,2017,750457,CA-14,0.04714846084156185
"An integrative multi-phenotype pipeline for drug evaluation, pharmacogenomics, and attribute prediction PROJECT SUMMARY The process of drug discovery is costly and many promising compounds fail during clinical trials. By then, expenses upward of $500 million dollars per failed drug may have incurred and these financial risks hamper research efforts and – ultimately – reduce the availability of treatment options. In this research proposal we are using systematic approaches to map the relationships between drugs, genes, and phenotypes, i.e. the ability of a drug to elicit a certain molecular response in a cell with a specific gene mutation. These efforts aim at generating three important insights:  (1) By performing these mapping systematically across many drugs and many phenotypes we generate  phenotypic profiles that can aid in the classification of new compounds, enabling us to predict how well  these compounds may fare in later clinical stages, thus reducing cost and risk in drug development;  (2) By characterizing existing drugs more thoroughly, we can discover novel off-label usages for existing  drugs, thus expanding treatment options of FDA-approved compounds;  (3) By understanding gene-drug-phenotype relationships one-by-one we can assemble a complete picture  of drug-gene interactions, an important milestone in the development of personalized  pharmacogenomics that would allow patient-specific treatment planning. To accomplish these goals, we will employ a novel yeast-based phenotypic screening platform and use data- driven ontologies to understand the similarities between drugs in the phenotype-gene space. Overall, this work will move us closer to a comprehensive understanding of how phenotypes arise from the genome and how complex relationships between genes and drugs shape our medical treatment strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to develop a drug-screening platform and database that will allow improved prediction of a drug's side-effects, mode-of-action, cross-reactivity and other important pharmacological attributes in the context of gene mutations. This system would reduce drug discovery cost, encourage rare disease research, and ultimately lead to personalized pharmacogenomics – the ability to select drugs and therapies based on the genetic makeup of individual patients to optimize treatment results.","An integrative multi-phenotype pipeline for drug evaluation, pharmacogenomics, and attribute prediction",9256264,R41TR001908,"['Award ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biotech ', ' Biotechnology ', ' Cellular Growth ', ' Cellular Expansion ', ' cell growth ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' genetic mapping ', ' Total Human and Non-Human Gene Mapping ', ' Linkage Mapping ', ' Gene Mapping Genetics ', ' Gene Mapping ', ' Gene Localization ', ' Chromosome Mapping ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' emotional dependency ', ' Dependency ', ' DNA Markers ', ' Unscheduled DNA Synthesis ', ' DNA Damage Repair ', ' DNA Repair ', ' Drug Evaluation Studies ', ' Drug Evaluation ', ' Drug Modelings ', ' Pre-clinical Drug Evaluation ', ' Drug Screening ', ' Preclinical Drug Evaluation ', ' drug treatment ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Economics ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Kinetics ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Libraries ', ' Maps ', ' Microtubules ', ' Micro-tubule ', ' Mitochondria ', ' mitochondrial ', ' Molecular Models ', ' Molecular Structure ', ' Macromolecular Structure ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Protein Kinase ', ' phosphorylase b kinase kinase ', ' hydroxyalkyl protein kinase ', ' glycogen synthase a kinase ', ' Kinase Family Gene ', ' ATP-protein phosphotransferase ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Risk ', ' Saccharomyces cerevisiae ', ' S. cerevisiae ', ' S cerevisiae ', "" Brewer's Yeast "", "" Baker's Yeast "", ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Toxicology ', ' Drug Side Effects ', ' Adverse drug effect ', ' Work ', ' Yeasts ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' genetic manipulation ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Shapes ', ' Reporter ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' gene interaction ', ' Gene Mutation ', ' Gene Alteration ', ' mutant ', ' stable cell line ', ' genotoxicity ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' knowledge base ', ' knowledgebase ', ' treatment planning ', ' molecular modeling ', ' Molecular Modeling Protein/Amino Acid Biochemistry ', ' Molecular Modeling Nucleic Acid Biochemistry ', ' Rare Diseases ', ' orphan disorder ', ' Rare Disorder ', ' Orphan Disease ', ' novel ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' response ', ' cross reactivity ', ' drug development ', ' high throughput screening ', ' High Throughput Assay ', ' Adverse effects ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' drug discovery ', ' Pharmacogenomics ', ' Alpha Cell ', ' α-cell ', ' Glucagon Secreting Cell ', ' Glucagon Cell ', ' small molecule ', ' Data ', ' Mutate ', ' Ontology ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' antimicrobial ', ' anti-microbial ', ' Cancerous ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' drug testing ', ' drug detection ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new drugs ', ' new drug treatments ', ' stem ', ' induced pluripotent stem cell ', ' iPSCs ', ' iPSC ', ' iPS ', ' FDA approved ', ' treatment strategy ', ' molecular phenotype ', ' drug candidate ', ' screening ', ' genetic makeup ', ' genetic make-up ', ' CRISPR/Cas technology ', ' Cas nuclease technology ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 ', ' CRISPR/Cas method ', ' CRISPR-CAS-9 ', ' CRISPR technology ', ' CRISPR technique ', ' CRISPR method ', ' individual patient ', ' phenotypic biomarker ', ' phenotypic marker ', ' ']",NCATS,"PHENVOGEN, LLC",R41,2017,224991,CA-49,0.027246677145386856
"Peripheral Nerve-on-a-chip for Predictive Preclinical Pharmaceutical Testing PROJECT SUMMARY The drug development pipeline is plagued by unacceptable rates of attrition due in large part to toxicities that are not identified in pre-clinical stages of development. The ability to de-risk lead compounds during pre-clinical development with advanced “organoid-on-a-chip” technologies shows tremendous promise. Drug-induced neurotoxicity is caused by off-target effects of pharmaceuticals that lead to sensory, motor, and cognitive deficits. While rarely fatal, drug-induced neurotoxicity can lead to permanent nerve damage and in some cases can be a dose-limiting side effect, leading patients to reduce dosage or stop treatment altogether. Although the peripheral nervous system bears the brunt of this neurological toxicity, development of microphysiological models of the peripheral nervous system is lagging. Towards that end, the technology described herein allows for 3D growth of high density axonal fiber tracts, resembling peripheral nerve anatomy. Progress during the prior award phase strongly demonstrated the feasibility of using microengineered neural tissues that are amenable to morphological and physiological measurements analogous to those of clinical tests. The use of structural and functional analyses should mean drug-induced neural toxicity will manifest in these measurements in ways that mimic clinical neuropathology. The goals of this proposal are to establish our human model using relevant physiological measurements in tissues fabricated from human iPS cells, and to validate the model system with a library of compounds, comparing against conventional cell culture models. Validating the peripheral nerve model system with drugs known to induce toxicity via a range of mechanisms will demonstrate the ability of the system to predict various classifications of neuropathy, yielding a high-content assay far more informative than traditional in vitro systems. PROJECT NARRATIVE Current methods available for bringing drugs to market have resulted in high attrition rates as compounds progress through the drug pipeline, resulting in unacceptable clinical trial toxicity and skyrocketing pharmaceutical prices. Improving the predictive power of preclinical models represents the fastest and most competitive method to advance the safety and time to market for new therapeutics.

"Development of integrative models for early liver toxicity assessment ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Computational toxicology has become a critical area of research due to the burgeoning need to evaluate thousands of pharmaceutical and environmental chemicals with unknown toxicity profiles, the high demand in time and resources by current experimental toxicity testing, and the growing ethical concerns over animal use in toxicity studies. Despite tremendous efforts, little success has been attained thus far in the development of predictive computational models for toxicity, primarily due to the complexity of toxicity mechanisms as well as the lack of high-quality experimental data for model development.  A critical challenge in toxicity testing of chemicals is that toxicity effects are doe-dependent: the true toxic hits may show no toxicity at all at low dose level. Therefore, traditiona high-throughput screening (HTS) that test chemicals only at a single concentration is not suitable for toxicity screening. On the contrary, the recently developed quantitative high-throughput screening (qHTS) platforms can evaluate each chemical across a broad range of concentrations, and is gaining ever-increasing popularity as a tool for in vitro toxicity profiling The concentration-response information generated by qHTS are expected to provide more accurate and comprehensive information of the toxicity effects of chemicals, offering promising data that can be mined to estimate in vivo toxicities of chemicals. However, our previous studies showed that if processed inappropriately, such concentration-response information contribute little to improve the toxicity prediction. This is especially true when multiple types of qHTS data are used together. Therefore, in this study, we will extend our previous approaches to develop novel statistical and computational tools that can curate, preprocess, and normalize the concentration-response information from multiple different qHTS databases.  Traditionally, toxicity models are based on either the chemical data (such as the quantitative structure- activity relationship analysis), or the in vitro toxicity profiling data (such as the in vitro-in vivo extrapolations). Our previous experiences suggested that integrating biological descriptors such as the in vitro cytotoxicity profiles or the short-term toxigenomic data, with chemical structural features is able to predict rodent acute liver toxicity with reasonable accuracy. Therefore, the second part of this proposal will be devoted to develop novel computational models for hepatotoxicity prediction by integrating qHTS toxicity profiles and chemical structural information In Aim 1, we will curate, preprocess, and normalize collected public liver toxicity datasets. In ths study, we will model toxicity effects using multiple large public datasets such as HTS and qHTS bioassay data (Tox21[1] and ToxCast[2]), hepatotoxicity side effect reports on marketed failed drugs[3], the Liver Toxicity Knowledge Base Benchmark Dataset (LTKB-BD[4]), etc. Statistical methods for cross-study validation and quality control will be applied to the collected datasets to ensure computational compatibility and to select the appropriate datasets for analysis. In Aim 2, we will develop predictive models for chemicals' liver toxicity based on an integrative modeling workflow that will make use of both structural and in vitro toxicity profiles of a chemical. Our previous studies [5] showed that models using both in vitro toxicity profiles and chemical structural data have better accuracy for rodent acute liver toxicity than models using either data type alone. Here, we will develop a novel modeling workflow that start with defining the functional clusters of chemicals via curated qHTS toxicity profiles, and is followed by developing computational models to correlate chemical and biological data with overall toxicity risks in humans. The predictive models will be validated using independent datasets with over 800 compounds. In Aim 3, we propose to prioritize the qHTS profiling assays used in the model for future toxicity testing. We will evaluate all the in vitro assays as biological descriptors from thee perspectives, including descriptor importance in the integrative toxicity model, correlation with i vivo DILI outcomes, and level of information content estimated by a novel approach based on network analysis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this study we aim to develop computational models that can identify potential liver toxicants. Liver toxicity is a significant contributor to the high attition rate in drug development. Moreover, toxic chemicals in food, water, and consumer products all pose serious risks for liver toxicity. As a result, there is great interest in developing high-throughput, high-content experimental and computational tools to evaluate the liver toxicity of thousands of pharmaceutical and environmental chemicals. This study focuses on developing novel informatics tools that enable the extraction and integration of chemical concentration-response information from multiple quantitative high-throughput screening databases for model development, and developing statistical models that are able to integrate this concentration-response information with chemical structural features to predict their risk of liver toxicity.

"Repurposing pyronaridine as a treatment for the Ebola virus Summary In 2014, the outbreak of the Ebola virus (EBOV) in West Africa highlighted the need for broad-spectrum antiviral drugs for this and other emerging viruses. Several groups had previously performed high throughput screens in 2013 and identified FDA approved drugs (amodiaquine, chloroquine, clomiphene and toremifene) with in vitro growth inhibitory activities against EBOV. We used these compounds to create a computational pharmacophore to identify additional compounds to test in vitro. In addition, data from a published large scale high throughput screen performed by SRI International and Texas Biomedical Research Institute was used to create machine learning models and then subsequently used to score clinical compounds for testing. We have published on how these combined methods identified 3 compounds for testing which were ultimately found to be nM in vitro. One of these compounds is an antimalarial approved in Europe called pyronaridine. We propose to characterize the ADME and PK properties of this compound prior to determining its efficacy in a mouse model of the Ebola virus infection. Therefore the Aims of this R21 proposal will fill some of the gaps inherent in the published data on pyronaridine so far: Aim 1. Perform preclinical in vitro characterization of pyronaridine. Aim 2. Formulate pyronaridine and perform PK studies in mouse. Aim 3. In vitro characterization of pyronaridine against multiple EBOV strains and in vivo efficacy in the mouse model of Ebola virus infection. The results of these aims will determine go/no go criteria for pursuing larger animal studies in non-human primates prior to clinical studies. In the light of a recent paper in the New England Journal of Medicine showing a clinical observation that EBOV patients treated with artesunate-amodiaquine had a 31% higher survival rate than those treated with artemether- lumefantrine 2, there will be considerable interest in evaluating antimalarials against Ebola. Our proposal to consider testing the efficacy in the mouse EBOV model using pyronaridine (which is used as artesunate- pyronaridine (Pyramax) and would be readily accessible in the clinic), presents a rapid approach to leverage the aforementioned clinical observations with a more potent compound. Pyronaridine also has additional benefits of tolerability which may be important in this patient population. Narrative Preliminary clinical data showed that Ebola virus (EBOV) patients treated with the antimalarials artesunate- amodiaquine had a higher survival rate than those treated with artemether-lumefantrine, in agreement with the in vitro EC50 for amodiaquine EC50 of 2.6µM. The antimalarial pyronaridine, a structural analog of amodiaquine, was identified by a computational repurposing strategy and further shown to have an EC50 of 420 nM against EBOV in vitro. We now propose to fully characterize this compound using standard preclinical ADME assays prior to mouse pharmacokinetic analysis, determine broad-spectrum applicability against multiple EBOV strains and ultimately in vivo efficacy testing in the mouse Ebola virus model prior to testing in a non-human primate model. Our aim is to show whether Pyronaridine is a viable clinical candidate to treat patients infected with EBOV.",Repurposing pyronaridine as a treatment for the Ebola virus,9357736,R21TR001718,"['Africa ', ' Amodiaquin ', ' Amodiaquine ', ' Animals ', ' inhibitor ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' Antimalarial Drugs ', ' Antimalarial Agents ', ' Anti-Malarials ', ' Antimalarials ', ' Antivirals ', ' Antiviral Drugs ', ' Antiviral Agents ', ' Piroplasma ', ' Babesia ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Physiologic Availability ', ' Biologic Availability ', ' Bioavailability ', ' Biological Availability ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Mainland China ', ' China ', ' Khingamin ', ' Chlorochin ', ' Chloroquine ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Chloramiphene ', ' Clomiphene ', ' Control Groups ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Outbreaks ', ' Disease Outbreaks ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Ebola ', ' Ebola virus ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Enzymes ', ' blood corpuscles ', ' Red blood corpuscule ', ' Red Cell ', ' Red Blood Cells ', ' Marrow erythrocyte ', ' Erythrocytic ', ' Erythrocytes Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood normocyte ', ' Blood erythrocyte ', ' Erythrocytes ', ' Europe ', ' Family ', ' Female ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Half-Life ', ' In Vitro ', ' Infection ', ' Intestines ', ' bowel ', ' Intestinal ', ' Lethal Dose 50 ', ' LD50 ', ' LD-50 ', ' Libraries ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' hepatic body system ', ' Malaria ', ' Plasmodium Infections ', ' Paludism ', ' Vivax Malaria ', ' Plasmodium vivax Malaria ', ' male ', ' Mannich Bases ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Inbred BALB C Mice ', ' BALB/c ', ' BALB C Mouse ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mus ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' New England ', ' Northeastern United States ', ' Paper ', ' Patients ', ' Permeability ', ' Drug Kinetics ', ' Pharmacokinetics ', ' Plasma ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma Proteins ', ' Plasmodium falciparum ', ' P.falciparum ', ' P. falciparum ', ' P falciparum ', ' Plasmodium vivax ', ' P. vivax ', ' P vivax ', ' Publishing ', ' Research Institute ', ' Solubility ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Testing ', ' Texas ', ' Time ', ' T. cruzi ', ' T cruzi ', ' American trypanosome ', ' Trypanosoma cruzi ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' virus infection ', ' viral infection ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' viral inhibitor ', ' Virus Inhibitors ', ' General Viruses ', ' Virus ', ' wt-loss ', ' body weight loss ', ' Weight Reduction ', ' Weight Loss ', ' Body Weight decreased ', ' O-methyldihydroartemisinine ', ' artemether ', ' artesunate ', ' pyronaridine ', ' Toremifene ', ' Filoviridae ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Magazine ', ' Journals ', ' base ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Filovirus ', ' Ensure ', ' non-human primate ', ' nonhuman primate ', ' European ', ' bound protein ', ' Protein Binding ', ' Ligand Binding Protein Gene ', ' Ligand Binding Protein ', ' Binding Proteins ', ' analog ', ' Whole Blood ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Hour ', ' Oral ', ' intraperitoneal ', ' Clinic ', ' treatment duration ', ' treatment days ', ' Treatment Period ', ' Route ', ' Techniques ', ' benflumetol ', ' lumefantrine ', ' interest ', ' pharmacophore ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Toxicities ', ' Agreement ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' high throughput screening ', ' High Throughput Assay ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Dose ', ' Bolus Infusion ', ' Bolus ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' in vivo ', ' Clinical Data ', ' clinical test ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Monitor ', ' Behavioral ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' pre-clinical study ', ' preclinical study ', ' PubChem ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' resistant to chloroquine ', ' resistance to chloroquine ', ' chloroquine resistant ', ' Chloroquine resistance ', ' neurotoxicity ', ' neuronal toxicity ', ' neuron toxicity ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' FDA approved ', ' patient population ', ' in vitro testing ', ' efficacy testing ', ' Natural Products ', ' Formulation ', ' clinical candidate ', ' ']",NCATS,"COLLABORATIONS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.",R21,2017,312390,NC-02,0.09810365180202549
"High-throughput, all-optical assay in human cardiomyoctes for clinically relevant prediction of drug induced cardiotoxity. ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Toxicity accounts for approximately 20% of drug attrition, of which nearly one third is attributed to cardiovascular issues, in particular arrhythmias.1 The cost of bringing a new drug to market can exceed $1.2 billion and require more than 10 years of research. Thus, it is critical to identify cardiotoxicity early in developmen. Current in vitro screening assays for pro-­‐arrhythmic drug effects focus on measuring inhibition of the hERG potassium channel, which has been linked to potentially lethal Torsades de Pointes arrhythmias (TdP).2 The hERG assay, however, lacks high sensitivity and specificity: not all QT prolongation is due to block of hERG alone and not all hERG blockers result in QT prolongation or induce TdP. To address these limitations, regulatory bodies have created the Comprehensive in vitro Proarrhythmia Assay (CiPA) initiative2, which proposes use of cardiomyocytes derived from human stem cells as an in vitro model for arrhythmogenic drug potential. Establishment of this model for toxicity screening requires detailed characterization of the cardiomyocyte action potential (AP) and calcium transient (CT), the response of APs/CTs to drugs, and the correlation to clinical outcomes in humans. High-­‐throughput tools needed for performing these measurements, however, have been lacking. Here we propose to develop a high-­‐throughput, all-­‐optical electrophysiology platform for cardiotoxicity screening in sem cell-­‐derived cardiomyocytes. With our Phase I award, we demonstrated that the Optopatch platform could be used to detect changes in the electrophysiological characteristics of human derived CMs following both acute and chronic drug treatment, albeit with the throughput of a single well per recording. To highly parallelize these measurements, we propose building a 96-­‐well plate Optopatch instrument for simultaneous recording of voltage and calcium waveforms under paced conditions from 24 wells. This geometry will provide nearly two orders of magnitude improvement in throughput of our assay. Optopatch constructs will be optimized to allow for incorporation of the actuator and reporter proteins in each cell. We will utilize this platform to screen 50 compounds with known risk scores for Torsades de Pointes in different sources of human cardiomyocytes and use this data to develop a predictive algorithm of arrhythmogenicity. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Q­‐State's technology will allow better prediction of a drug candidate's potential adverse effects to the human heart than the assays mandated by the current cardiac safety guidance ICH S7B.   It will contribute to bringing effective healthcare solutions to market at lower cost and higher productivity, by preventing drugs with cardiotoxicity from reaching the market and preventing the development of valuable therapeutics from being wrongly terminated, which is one of the concerns about the current S7B assays. Making Q-­‐State instrumentation and reagents available to the academic research community will facilitate better mechanistic studies and therapeutics development to benefit patients with cardiac conditions.","High-throughput, all-optical assay in human cardiomyoctes for clinically relevant prediction of drug induced cardiotoxity.",9247825,R44HL126314,"['Action Potentials ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Algorithms ', ' Heart Arrhythmias ', ' Cardiac Arrhythmia ', ' Arrhythmia ', ' Award ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Life Sciences ', ' Bioscience ', ' Biologic Sciences ', ' Biological Sciences ', ' Factor IV ', ' Coagulation Factor IV ', ' Ca++ element ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor IV ', ' Calcium ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardio-vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Communities ', ' drug treatment ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Environmental Science ', ' Ecology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Engineering ', ' Health ', ' Heart ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' In Vitro ', ' Institutes ', ' instrumentation ', ' Ion Channel ', ' Membrane Channels ', ' Ionic Channels ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Manuals ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Paper ', ' Patients ', ' Potassium Channel ', ' Potassium Ion Channels ', ' K channel ', ' Production ', ' Productivity ', ' Proteins ', ' Reagent ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' RNA ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' Safety ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Torsades de Pointes ', ' USFDA ', ' Food and Drug Administration ', ' United States Food and Drug Administration ', ' Vendor ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Blinded ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' cardiomyocyte ', ' Heart myocyte ', ' Heart Muscle Cells ', ' Cardiocyte ', ' Cardiac Muscle Cells ', ' Cardiac Myocytes ', ' Measurement ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Contracts ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Reporter ', ' tool ', ' instrument ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Hour ', ' Frequencies ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Services ', ' success ', ' voltage ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Toxicities ', ' Reporting ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Modeling ', ' Human Characteristics ', ' Human Nature ', ' response ', ' Cardiotoxicity ', ' Cardiotoxic ', ' Cardiac Toxicity ', ' Adverse effects ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' drug discovery ', ' patch clamp ', ' Provider ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' molecular signature ', ' molecular profile ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' Resolution ', ' in vitro Model ', ' Cell Maturation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Cardiac ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Phototoxicity ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' human stem cells ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new drugs ', ' new drug treatments ', ' induced pluripotent stem cell ', ' iPSCs ', ' iPSC ', ' iPS ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' therapeutic development ', ' therapeutic agent development ', ' public health relevance ', ' stem cell biology ', ' drug candidate ', ' phase 1 study ', ' Phase I Study ', ' optogenetics ', ' screening ', ' Geometry ', ' Algorithmic Analysis ', ' Analysis of Algorithms ', ' Analyses of Algorithms ', ' Algorithmic Analyses ', ' rate of change ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' ']",NHLBI,"Q-STATE BIOSCIENCES, INC.",R44,2017,369580,MA-07,0.04735353078705498
"The Microscopic Imaging of Epigenetic Landscape- NeuroDevelopment (MIEL-ND) assay: a high throughput platform to screen compounds for neurodevelopmental effects Neurodevelopmental diseases (NDDs – Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Intellectual Disabilities, Bipolar disorders, and Schizophrenia, etc.) are prevalent and due to errors in neurodifferentiation and neurocircuitry. While NDDs, in many cases, are due to inherited mutations, evidence is mounting that prenatal exposure to environmental toxicants also cause NDDs via disruption of epigenetics (e.g., modifications of histones [histone tags] or methylation of DNA). Our project will develop the Microscopic Imaging of Epigenetic Landscape- NeuroDevelopment (MIEL-ND) assay, which will enable testing of chemicals for epigenetic effects related to NDDs. In preliminary research by Alexey Terskikh (Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute) MIEL methods were developed in which human Neural Precursor Cells (NPCs, from fetal brain) were treated with test compounds and analyzed for changes in the pattern of histone tags within the nuclei (altered “epigenetic signature” – which utilizes multiplexed immunolabeling, automated high throughput imaging, and cell-by-cell analysis using machine learning). A subset of chemicals from the US EPA ToxCast program was analyzed, and “epigenetic hits” were identified. In a separate approach, Vala Sciences Inc, which commercializes cell-based assays relevant to toxicology/drug discovery, tested EPA compounds on synapses/neurite formation in neurons developed from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC-neurons), which represent human neurons in early stages of maturation. When results from the assays were compared, several epigenetic hits also altered synapse and neurite formation in the iPSC-neurons consistent with the hypothesis that epigenetic alterations may alter fate decisions of NPCs and neurodevelopment. To further develop the MIEL-ND, we propose to screen additional ToxCast compounds for effects on epigenetic and cell fate NPCs and test the compounds for effects on synapse/neurites in iPSC-neurons to develop a library of epigenetic hits with known effects on the two cell types. We will use these data and emerging data from the ToxCast program, to develop and optimize the MIEL-ND to predict NDD-inducing effects of possible environmental toxicants. The MIEL- ND will identify compounds that affect neurodevelopment that are not cytotoxic (which are missed by current assays) and represents a less expensive, higher throughput, more predictive alternative to current tests which use animals, thus reducing the use of animals in toxicity testing. Phase II goals include developing a version of the MIEL-ND featuring iPSC-NPCs (enabling use of cells derived from patients with NDDs), and adaptation of the assay to identify potential therapeutics for NDDs. Our proposed project will develop an assay to enable us to test environmental pollutants for their potential to cause neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) such as Autism, Intellectual Disability [retardation], Bipolar Disease [Manic Depression], and Schizophrenia. While many cases of NDDs are due to inherited mutations (the disease “runs in the family”), recent research indicates that exposure of the mother to pollution during pregnancy can cause NDDs in children that would otherwise be healthy. This is because development of the fetal brain is very sensitive to toxins. In our assay, cells representing early stages of brain development will be cultured in the laboratory and treated with compounds from the US EPA that are linked to NDDs. The cells will be photographed with robotic microscopes and the images analyzed with computers to determine which compounds may alter neurodevelopment. Currently, testing for effects on brain development of the fetus is done with animal testing. Our assay will be cheaper, more rapid, and more predictive than animal models (since it will use human cells); our assay will reduce the use of animals in toxicity research, which is a big problem, as hundreds of new compounds are developed, each year, for use in agriculture and manufacturing, and help reduce the number of people afflicted with NDDs.",The Microscopic Imaging of Epigenetic

"Development of a metabolomics and machine learning based high-throughput screening platform for data-driven drug discovery Project Summary High-throughput omics technologies allow for measuring various biomolecules comprehensively and over the past decade have become exponentially less expensive. Coupling these developing emerging technologies with automation approaches and the phenotypic-based drug discovery paradigm allows for “data-driven” drug discovery (D4). D4 focuses on a complete cellular readout, quantitatively measuring 100s to 100,000s of biomolecules, rather than focusing on a single protein, pathway, or physiological trait. The complexity of this data requires computational tools for proper analysis and interpretation. A pioneering project and dataset for D4 is the Broad Institute’s Connectivity Map, which is a transcriptomics screening and query platform for drug characterization, discovery, and repositioning. Though with many successes, the Connectivity Map is based on only a single biomolecule type, RNA, and downstream effects caused by chemical perturbations to proteins and metabolites are ignored. In this proposal, we combine the dual strengths of experts in LC-MS/MS based metabolomics (Omix Technologies) with leaders in metabolic network modeling and metabolomics data analysis (Sinopia Biosciences) to develop a metabolomics based high-throughput compound screening platform. Our preliminary data for two major drugs (doxorubicin and rapamycin) showcases that our approach has technical validity, accuracy, and provides potential biological utility that complements transcriptomics based approaches. This Phase I proposal will assess the biological utility of a metabolomics-based screening platform. First, we will profile ~250 FDA approved small molecules from a broad range of drug classes. Second, we will develop the necessary bioinformatics pipelines, mechanistic metabolic models, and machine learning algorithms to analyze and interpret these complex datasets. Finally, we will assess whether adding metabolomics data to the Connectivity Map boosts D4 predictions including assessing compound mechanisms of actions, compound similarity, identifying biomarkers for drug efficacy and safety, and identifying drug repurposing opportunities. After the biological utility of this approach is demonstrated in Phase I, Phase II will focus on profiling of novel chemical and genetic perturbations to further demonstrate the power of the platform and identify commercial opportunities for treating rare genetic diseases. Project Narrative Data-driven drug discovery provides the potential to accelerate drug development timelines, decrease costs, and ultimately provide better care to patients. Combining Sinopia Bioscience’s and Omix Technologies strengths in high-throughput data generation and analysis, we will build a unique platform focused on the impact of human metabolism in disease. This proposal will test the viability of this approach and focus on several rare genetic diseases with significant unmet needs.",Development of a metabolomics and machine learning based high-throughput screening platform for data-driven drug discovery,9621965,R43GM130268,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Automation ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Sciences ', ' Life Sciences ', ' Bioscience ', ' Biologic Sciences ', ' cell growth ', ' Cellular Growth ', ' Cellular Expansion ', ' Cell Line ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Doxorubicin ', ' Hydroxyldaunorubicin ', ' Hydroxyl Daunorubicin ', ' Doxorubicina ', ' Adriamycine ', ' 14-Hydroxydaunomycin ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Evolution ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' In Vitro ', ' Institutes ', ' Luminescent Proteins ', ' Photoproteins ', ' Bioluminescent Proteins ', ' Maps ', ' Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Methodology ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmaceutical Services ', ' Pharmacy Services ', ' Pharmaceutic Services ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physiological Processes ', ' Physiologic Processes ', ' Organismal Process ', ' Organism-Level Process ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' RNA ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' Safety ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Sirolimus ', ' Rapamycin ', ' Rapamune ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' TimeLine ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Biochemical ', ' Chemicals ', ' Data Quality ', ' Measurement ', ' Metabolic Networks ', ' Biochemical Pathway ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Collaborations ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Metabolic ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' MCF7 cell ', ' MCF7 ', ' MCF-7WT ', ' MCF-7DR ', ' MCF-7 Cell ', ' MCF-7 ', ' success ', ' drug efficacy ', ' synergism ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' trait ', ' novel ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' drug development ', ' high throughput screening ', ' High Throughput Assay ', ' Adverse effects ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Genomics ', ' drug discovery ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' chemical genetics ', ' metabolomics ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' small molecule ', ' Microarray Analysis ', ' microarray technology ', ' microarray analyses ', ' Microarray-Based Analysis ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' molecular signature ', ' molecular profile ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' in vivo ', ' Emergent Technologies ', ' Emerging Technologies ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' protein metabolite ', ' cost ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' data integration ', ' Cancer cell line ', ' cost efficient ', ' Coupling ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' transcriptomics ', ' data acquisition ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new drugs ', ' new drug treatments ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' network models ', ' commercialization ', ' FDA approved ', ' molecular phenotype ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' screening ', ' multi-omics ', ' multiple omics ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' genetic disorder ', ' genetic condition ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' ']",NIGMS,"SINOPIA BIOSCIENCES, INC.",R43,2018,442427,CA-49,0.023237114104898222

"Early development of small molecule dendritic cell immunopotentiators for the treatment of solid tumors Summary The critical role of the innate immune system in priming CD8+ T cells to generate tumor specific responses underscores a potentially important clinical strategy for the development of next-generation immunotherapies. In this proposal, we pursue the hypothesis that small molecules identified in a high throughput screen for innate immune agonists can significantly improve the therapeutic efficacy of the oncolytic NDV (NewCastle Disease Virus) through activation of antigen presenting cells (APCs), and enhancement of anticancer immune responses. To address this, we propose specific aims that focus on hit validation through both ex vivo and in vivo characterization of compounds and assessing the in vivo efficacy in a B16-F10 mouse melanoma model. First, utilizing orthogonal assays, we will validate the immunopotentiation properties of compounds in ex vivo human primary monocyte derived dendritic cell (MDDC). Specifically, we propose to assess compound effects on MDDC activation and maturation through examination of transcriptional profiles, expression of DC activation markers, and cytokines being secreted upon compound treatment. Validated hits will then be clustered based on their activities, and the most potent compounds from each cluster will be carried forward to anti-tumor efficacy testing in a mouse melanoma model. Compounds will be added either alone or together with intratumoral injection of oncolytic NDV. Compound that synergize and enhance the anti-tumor activity of NDV, provide durable protection, and abscopal activity will be prioritized for subsequent early lead optimization.  Based on data generated from these hit validation approaches, we propose to delineate ex vivo immune signatures that can be used as surrogates for in vivo efficacy. The immune signatures elicited by selected hits within both MDDCs (ex vivo) and the tumor microenvironment (TME - in vivo) will be integrated to construct a computational model to assess correlative signatures that are able to link MDDC molecular and phenotypic responses to in vivo efficacy. Similar analysis will be conducted on immune activation readouts in the TME. This will be a reiterative process, with information obtained from the experimental studies will be utilized to refine predictions of ex vivo and in vivo biomarkers that correlate with efficacy. The information gained from this proposed study upon completion will significantly facilitate further hit-to-lead and lead optimization activities during subsequent phases of the drug development process. Narrative Newcastle Disease virus (NDV) is a promising viral agent for cancer therapy, due to its ability to induce Type-I IFNs, activation of antigen presenting cells (APCs) and lymphocyte infiltration into the tumor microenvironment, and induce systemic cytotoxic T cell immune responses. Using a high throughput screening approach, we have identified small molecule immunopotentiators of dendritic cell activation, and found that they harbor potent synergistic activities with oncolytic NDV in a mouse tumor model. The proposed study has a strong potential of generating T cell responses against tumor-specific antigens expressed by a patient’s individual cancer, potentially offering a novel immunotherapeutic

"Next Generation Testing Strategies for Assessment of Genotoxicity Project Summary  It is well recognized that current batteries of genetic toxicology assays exhibit two critical deficiencies. First, the throughput capacity of in vitro mammalian cell genotoxicity tests is low, and does not meet current needs. Second, conventional assays provide simplistic binary calls, genotoxic or non-genotoxic. In this scheme there is little or no consideration for potency, and virtually no information is provided about molecular targets and mechanisms. These deficiencies in hazard characterization prevent genotoxicity data from optimally contributing to modern risk assessments, where this information is essential. We will address these major problems with current in vitro mammalian cell genetic toxicity assays by developing methods and associated commercial assay kits that dramatically enhance throughput capacity, and delineate genotoxicants' primary molecular targets, while simultaneously providing information about potency. Once biomarkers and a family of multiplexed assays have been developed for these purposes, an interlaboratory trial will be performed with prototype assay kits to assess the transferability of the methods. Project Narrative  DNA damage that cannot be faithfully repaired results in gene mutation and/or chromosomal aberrations, and these effects are known to contribute to cancer and other severe diseases. Thus, there is an important need for sensitive assays to evaluate chemicals for genotoxic and other deleterious effects. The work proposed herein will address issues that have plagued genotoxicity assessments for the last several decades: low throughput, lack of potency metrics, and little to no information about molecular targets.

"Development of targeted, safe and effective drugs against pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) by leveraging a novel, comprehensive, computational drug discovery approach Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the United States with a median survival of <6 months and a 5-yr survival rate of 3%-8%. The aggressive biology and resistance to currently used therapeutic agents underscore the clear unmet need for the development of effective therapies against PDAC. Development of therapeutically important small molecules has benefited from computational drug discovery methods over three decades. However, these approaches suffer from significant limitations. twoXAR has developed a computational drug discovery approach that overcomes these limitations. Building on our prior success in identifying candidate drugs for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), we propose to use an artificial intelligence (AI) driven platform developed by twoXAR to identify new drug candidates as potential effective therapies for PDAC. In preliminary studies, we showed that TXR-311, a lead candidate selected based on our platform for efficacy against HCC significantly inhibited growth of: (a) HCC cell-lines, but not healthy hepatocytes and (b) orthotopic mouse HCC patient-derived xenografts (PDX). Moreover, (c) we also used our AI-based approach to predict validated candidates for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), multiple sclerosis (MS), and type 2 diabetes (T2D). The efficiency in drug discovery resulting from computational models provides an opportunity to build a portfolio of drug programs that traditional discovery methods don't allow for without hundreds of millions of dollars and many years. twoXAR’s approach to developing drug pipeline through partnerships and spin-outs enables us to apply our technology broadly across therapeutic areas, put drug development in the hands of expert drug developers, and create a portfolio of drug programs that significantly increases the probability of a twoXAR-discovered treatment benefiting patients. In the current Phase I SBIR proposal, we will identify candidate drugs to treat PDAC, using our platform. The specific aims are: Aim 1: Leverage twoXAR’s AI platform to identify lead candidates to treat PDAC. Milestone: Screen at least 100 hits that emerge based on aggregate scoring and identify at least 10 leads for further analysis and in vitro/in vivo validation. Aim 2: Use industry-standard preclinical assays to validate lead drug candidates. Milestone: Identification of a primary lead candidate for the treatment of PDAC. After successful completion of the proposed studies, we will develop the identified lead candidate for the treatment of PDAC through a Phase II SBIR mechanism to conduct mechanism of action (MoA), safety, and efficacy studies followed by early feasibility human studies, with the overarching goal of regulatory submission to the FDA and market commercialization. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the United States with a median survival of <6 months, and resistance to currently used therapeutic agents. twoXAR has developed an artificial intelligence (AI) driven platform to identify new drug candidates as potential effective therapies.

"Multiplexed high-content assay for toxicity profiling using live iPSC-derived cardiomyocyte lines with lineage-specific barcoding Project Summary/Abstract Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are poised to transform toxicological evaluation, however new approaches to enable their functional and structural profiling are needed to improve the utility of hiPSC -based models for predictive and mechanistic toxicology screening. This need is addressed by our project’s Specific Aims that encompass (1) development of a novel platform for generation of hiPSC-derived reporter cells; (2) generation of a panel of multicolor hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) with stable lineage specific fluorescent reporters; and (3) implementation and validation of a pilot machine learning-enabled predictive cardiotoxicity screen using these tools. The proposed tools are configured to be extensible to other toxicology- relevant pathways and phenotypes making it uniquely positioned to capitalize on the growing commercial need for high-throughput predictive toxicology assays. The project deliverables benefit public health by improving the ability to rapidly identify liabilities in specific cardiomyocyte lineage types, thus reducing the time and cost to pinpoint cardiotoxicity of pharmaceutical and environmental chemicals. Project Narrative The assay and reagents established in the course of this project directly address the goals of significant initiatives to improve the effectiveness of cardiotoxicity testing, such as the FDA’s CiPA initiative and the work of the Cardiac Safety Research Consortium. The resulting improvements in the pace and precision of drug testing will result in public health benefit through the development of more cost-effective and safer medicines. Beyond toxicological evaluation of therapeutic compounds, our innovative technology will deliver additional benefit to public health by virtue of its utility in investigating the toxicities of environmental chemicals, in line with the focus of government agencies and initiatives such as the EPA and Tox21 in the US and EU-ToxRisk in Europe.",Multiplexed high-content assay for toxicity profiling using live iPSC-derived cardiomyocyte lines with lineage-specific barcoding,9623156,R44TR002572,"['Algorithms ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Cell Line ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Drug Modelings ', ' Drug toxicity ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Europe ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Government Agencies ', ' Heart Atrium ', ' atrium ', ' Cardiac Atrium ', ' Atrial ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' In Vitro ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Microscopy ', ' Mitochondria ', ' mitochondrial ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Public Health ', ' Reagent ', ' Research ', ' Safety ', ' Sarcomeres ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Toxicology ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' base ', ' immortalized cell ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Phase ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Chemicals ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' cardiomyocyte ', ' Heart myocyte ', ' Heart Muscle Cells ', ' Cardiocyte ', ' Cardiac Muscle Cells ', ' Cardiac Myocytes ', ' Withdrawal ', ' Toxicity Testing ', ' Toxicity Tests ', ' Cell Structure ', ' Cell Components ', ' Cellular Structures ', ' Cell Lineage ', ' Contracts ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Reporter ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Nodal ', ' Nuclear ', ' innovative technologies ', ' success ', ' expression vector ', ' cell immortalization ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Toxicities ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' Reporting ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Treatment-Related Cancer ', ' Treatment-Associated Cancer ', ' Therapy-Related Cancer ', ' Therapy-Associated Cancers ', ' Therapy Related Malignant Tumor ', ' Therapy Related Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Iatrogenic Cancer ', ' response ', ' high throughput screening ', ' High Throughput Assay ', ' Cardiotoxicity ', ' Cardiotoxic ', ' Cardiac Toxicity ', ' drug discovery ', ' model development ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' Effectiveness ', ' therapeutic evaluation ', ' therapeutic testing ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' cell assay ', ' Cellular Assay ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' Validation ', ' Ventricular ', ' Cardiac ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' cost ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' site-specific integration ', ' drug detection ', ' drug testing ', ' environmental chemical ', ' iPSCs ', ' iPSC ', ' iPS ', ' induced pluripotent stem cell ', ' therapeutic agent development ', ' therapeutic development ', ' screening ', ' clinical predictors ', ' phase I trial ', ' genomic editing ', ' genome editing ', ' Industry Standard ', ' Cas nuclease technology ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 technology ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 ', ' CRISPR/Cas method ', ' CRISPR-based tool ', ' CRISPR-based technology ', ' CRISPR-based technique ', ' CRISPR-based method ', ' CRISPR-CAS-9 ', ' CRISPR technology ', ' CRISPR technique ', ' CRISPR methodology ', ' CRISPR method ', ' CRISPR/Cas technology ', ' predictive tools ', ' clinical candidate ', ' predictive assay ', ' predictive test ', ' ']",NCATS,"CAIRN BIOSCIENCES, INC.",R44,2018,1178386,CA-12,0.06123476616999308
"Centralized assay datasets for modelling support of small drug discovery organizations Project Summary The growing importance of artificial intelligence (AI) is visible by the growth in companies and increasing deals over the past year between pharma and smaller companies using machine learning to assist in drug discovery. The continuing steady growth of structure-activity data for diverse targets, diseases and molecular properties poses a considerable challenge as they are generally not readily accessible for machine learning: content resides in a mixture of public databases (with differing levels of curation), disparate files within research groups, non- curated literature publications. In Phase I, Collaborations Pharmaceuticals Inc. developed a prototype of Assay Central software and used this with a wide variety of structure activity data from sources both public and private, formatted and unformatted, for enabling neglected, rare or common disease targets. Public data was mixed with collaborator/customer-contributed data, using original software and applied chemistry judgment of an expert team. In Phase I we created error checking and correction software. We also built and validated Bayesian models with the datasets that were collected and cleaned. And, in addition, we developed new data visualization tools. The software environment that we created readily enables the user to compile structure-activity data for building computational models and can be used to create selections of these models for sharing with collaborators as needed. This software can in turn be used for scoring new molecules and visualizing the multiple outputs in various formats. We have enabled ~14 collaborative projects which have shared models on specific targets such as PyrG for Tuberculosis (identifying a lead compound), HIV reverse transcriptase, whole cell screening for Leishmaniasis as well as P450 and nuclear receptor models (e.g. estrogen receptor) relevant to toxicology. We have utilized Assay Central in our ongoing internal projects working on Ebola, HIV and tuberculosis small molecule drug discovery. In Phase II, we propose the following aims that will enable us to develop Assay Central into a production tool for enabling drug discovery collaborations which we will continue to focus on. In Phase 1 we performed a preliminary analysis of different machine learning algorithms with select drug discovery datasets. In Phase II we will now perform a thorough evaluation and selection of additional machine learning algorithms and molecular descriptors as well as assessment of combination of algorithms (e.g. Bayesian and Deep Learning). We will implement disease/target definitions for machine learning models to facilitate drug discovery. We will enable molecule selection and automated design and optimization. The utility of having such a tool as Assay Central readily available will empower scientists to leverage public, private or a combination of data to help with their drug discovery tasks. Developing this software suite of computational models with public data will enable us to identify foundations, academics and potential collaborators that generate preliminary data to test models. These efforts will dramatically increase the number of projects we can work on, create new IP, and generate employment using machine learning focused on drug discovery in the area of rare and neglected diseases, in particular. Assay Central benefits include 1. Ease of deployment and use with a Java file executed by users without the need for IT support; 2. Built on industry standard technologies; 3. Graphical display of models provides instant feedback; 4 Model applicability with multiple methods to assess scores and graphics. Project Narrative In Phase I Collaborations Pharmaceuticals Inc. have developed a prototype of ‘Assay Central’ software and used this with a wide variety of structure activity data from sources both public and private, formatted and unformatted, for enabling neglected, rare or common disease targets. The software environment that we created readily enables us to compile structure-activity data for building computational models, can be used to create selections of these models for sharing with collaborators and has been used successfully to find promising lead compounds for many collaborators. We now propose in Phase II to optimize the underlying machine learning algorithms and molecular descriptors (e.g. combining Bayesian and Deep Learning), linking potentially thousands of rare and neglected diseases to the machine learning models, and automating molecule selection and new molecule design to enable further high value drug discovery collaborations with Assay Central.",Centralized

"Peripheral Nerve-on-a-chip for Predictive Preclinical Pharmaceutical Testing PROJECT SUMMARY The drug development pipeline is plagued by unacceptable rates of attrition due in large part to toxicities that are not identified in pre-clinical stages of development. The ability to de-risk lead compounds during pre-clinical development with advanced “organoid-on-a-chip” technologies shows tremendous promise. Drug-induced neurotoxicity is caused by off-target effects of pharmaceuticals that lead to sensory, motor, and cognitive deficits. While rarely fatal, drug-induced neurotoxicity can lead to permanent nerve damage and in some cases can be a dose-limiting side effect, leading patients to reduce dosage or stop treatment altogether. Although the peripheral nervous system bears the brunt of this neurological toxicity, development of microphysiological models of the peripheral nervous system is lagging. Towards that end, the technology described herein allows for 3D growth of high density axonal fiber tracts, resembling peripheral nerve anatomy. Progress during the prior award phase strongly demonstrated the feasibility of using microengineered neural tissues that are amenable to morphological and physiological measurements analogous to those of clinical tests. The use of structural and functional analyses should mean drug-induced neural toxicity will manifest in these measurements in ways that mimic clinical neuropathology. The goals of this proposal are to establish our human model using relevant physiological measurements in tissues fabricated from human iPS cells, and to validate the model system with a library of compounds, comparing against conventional cell culture models. Validating the peripheral nerve model system with drugs known to induce toxicity via a range of mechanisms will demonstrate the ability of the system to predict various classifications of neuropathy, yielding a high-content assay far more informative than traditional in vitro systems. PROJECT NARRATIVE Current methods available for bringing drugs to market have resulted in high attrition rates as compounds progress through the drug pipeline, resulting in unacceptable clinical trial toxicity and skyrocketing pharmaceutical prices. Improving the predictive power of preclinical models represents the fastest and most competitive method to advance the safety and time to market for new therapeutics. As an added benefit, decreased drug development costs should also expand the availability of novel treatment options for patients.",Peripheral Nerve-on-a-chip for Predictive Preclinical Pharmaceutical Testing,9782089,R42TR001270,"['Action Potentials ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Animals ', ' Award ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Cell Culture Techniques ', ' cell culture ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Spinal Ganglia ', ' dorsal root ganglion ', ' Dorsal Root Ganglia ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' In Vitro ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Libraries ', ' Methods ', ' Biological Models ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Nerve ', ' Nerve Tissue ', ' Nervous Tissue ', ' Neural Conduction ', ' Nerve Conduction ', ' Neurons ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Organoids ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Peripheral Nerves ', ' Physiology ', ' Rattus ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Rat ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Schwann Cells ', ' Neurilemmal Cell ', ' Neurilemma Cell ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Measures ', ' Price ', ' pricing ', ' Neurites ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Programmed Cell Death ', ' Apoptosis Pathway ', ' Apoptosis ', ' base ', ' density ', ' dosage ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Peripheral ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Peripheral Nervous System ', ' Training ', ' Fiber ', ' Measurement ', ' Coculture ', ' Cocultivation ', ' Co-culture ', ' Coculture Techniques ', ' Morphology ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Neuropathy ', ' neuropathic ', ' Sensory ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Hydrogels ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Toxicities ', ' Speed ', ' expectation ', ' Cognitive deficits ', ' cognitive defects ', ' novel ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' motor deficit ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' drug development ', ' neuropathology ', ' Adverse effects ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' drug discovery ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' Institution ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation ', ' ChIP assay ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Dose-Limiting ', ' Measurable ', ' Motor ', ' Pre-Clinical Model ', ' Preclinical Models ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Preparation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' axonal growth ', ' axon growth ', ' cost ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Cellular model ', ' Cell model ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' neurotoxic ', ' neuronal toxicity ', ' neuron toxicity ', ' neurotoxicity ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new drugs ', ' new drug treatments ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' iPSCs ', ' iPSC ', ' iPS ', ' induced pluripotent stem cell ', ' drug candidate ', ' Regimen ', ' clinical predictors ', ' Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy ', ' pre-clinical development ', ' preclinical development ', ' testing services ', ' Drug Screening ', ' human model ', ' organ on chip ', ' organ on a chip ', ' microphysiology platform ', ' microphysiology model ', ' microphysiologic system ', ' microphysiologic platform ', ' microphysiologic model ', ' microphysiology system ', ' ']",NCATS,"AXOSIM, INC.",R42,2018,240000,LA-02,0.11118451304957072
"Rules for penetrating the Gram-negative bacterial envelope The development of new antimicrobials has drastically lagged behind the fast growth of drug resistant pathogenic microbes, especially for Gram-negative (GN) bacteria. To be effective in GN bacteria, entering and staying in the cells is a challenge. Insight into the physicochemical properties that enable the entrance of compounds is critical to direct future effort in the development of effective treatment against GN pathogens. Toward this goal, we will develop methods to accurately quantify the accumulation of small molecule compounds, without requiring fluorescence or other properties for detection, and independent of their antibacterial activity. In addition, we will develop a novel computational algorithm to describe and predict physicochemical properties that favors entry and evade efflux in GN bacteria. The computer model will be validated and refined through the selection and characterization of ~1,500 of compounds. Specifically, we will pursue the following aims: Aim 1) To develop and validate LC-MS/MS based assays to quantify compound partition. We will use a panel of antibiotics as ""gold standards"" to develop and validate assays to accurately determine the accumulation of small molecule compounds in different cellular compartments. We will develop LC-MS/MS assays and experiment with the kinetics of entrance, optimizing the conditions to enable reproducible and accurate quantification. We will use a CRE strain of E. coli and a MDR strain of Acinetobacter baumannii in this study. Aim 2) To develop a computational algorithm for predicting compounds that are potentially good penetrators for GN bacteria. We will develop a new and highly accurate computational algorithm through machine learning which can systematically recognize all favorable structural factors of the compounds effective for GN bacteria. Selected compounds will be experimentally characterized in Aim 3, the knowledge from which will be incorporated back into refining the computational algorithm to generate a new round of learning/prediction. This cycle will be repeated, with the testing of ~1,500 compounds in total. Aim 3) To measure the accumulation and subcellular distribution of selected compounds and to validate rules on compound accumulation. With the assays from Aim 1, we will measure the accumulation data of compounds selected through Aim 2. Data from these analyses will be used to polish the computer model in Aim 2. Finally, the models will be evaluated through measurement of accumulation data of selected compounds and examine if the experimental data match the prediction. The knowledge gap about penetrating the cellular envelope has become the biggest hurdle to the rational design of new classes of antimicrobials against all GN pathogens. Outcome from the proposed study will help bridge the gap between a potent inhibitor and an effective antibacterial drug. The combined use of the detailed experimental assays and the new computational algorithm will empower drug discovery efforts that aim to identify promising drug candidates targeting GN bacteria.

"Novel Methodology for Identification of Senolytics that Reduce Age-related Disease and Dysfunction DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic diseases of aging account for a significant proportion of healthcare spending and result in a painful and limiting existence for many tens of millions of Americans and hundreds of millions of people around the world. Recursion Pharmaceuticals has developed a drug discovery platform that re-purposes known drugs for the treatment of such diseases. The platform consists of high content fluorescent image analysis using machine-learning algorithms to identify relevant and on-target changes induced in human cells in which diseases and treatments have been modeled. This system has been adapted to screen for drugs which may preferentially destroy senescent cells, as this may result in improved tissue function and decreases in pathology and mortality related to aging. In this SBIR fast-track proposal we will:  PHASE I Identify a morphological profile of senescence in a variety of human cell types. Progression to Phase II will depend on our ability to demonstrate the power of our morphological approach to identify senescent cells independent of any known senescent markers.  PHASE II Identify known drugs which preferentially destroy senescent cells, without affecting healthy cells, as identified by morphometric means.  Evaluate the efficacy of identified senolytic agents in a variety of tissue function and health-span models in mice. *Evaluate the effect of identified senolytic agents in a murine model of age-associated cardiovascular disease. Recursion Pharmaceuticals has the experience, tools, and drive to execute this Phase I/Phase II Fast-track SBIR proposal, and to accelerate commercial development of any compounds we identify as a result. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic diseases of aging affect a significant proportion of Americans.

"Development of a Biocatalytic Platform for Convergent Synthesis of Chiral Amines Project Abstract  The protection of human health depends on the continued discovery of biologically active compounds and their development into useful pharmaceuticals. Historically, synthetic chemistry has enabled medicinal chemists to create and optimize novel lead compounds and has empowered process chemists to produce compounds at the scale necessary for the treatment of a population. The processes of drug discovery and drug production are undergoing a dramatic change with the development of efficient enzyme catalysts as practical tools for synthesis. Medicinal chemists are now harnessing the promiscuous activities of enzymes to access in a single step medicinally relevant compounds that otherwise require multiple-step chemical syntheses. Further, process chemists are starting to leverage the unrivalled efficiency and inherent sustain- ability of enzymes to replace the expensive catalysts and the toxic reagents and solvents that characterize many current production routes. As a result, enzymes are rapidly becoming important tools for pharmaceu- tical synthesis.  These transformative developments are unfortunately limited by the relative dearth of useful synthetic reactions in the ‘biocatalytic toolbox’. Our group has made fundamental advances to expanding this toolbox by using directed evolution to obtain new, useful biocatalysts starting from enzymes whose activities may have been low or even undetectable for the desired substrate or reaction.  This proposal seeks to expand and generalize a powerful biocatalytic platform for the synthesis of chiral amines. Such compounds are prevalent as building blocks for pharmaceuticals that encompass all realms of human health such as antibacterial, antifungal, and anticancer drugs. The ability to improve upon these compounds is dependent on access to suitable building blocks. We have identified the enzyme TrpB as a unique biocatalyst for the synthesis of chiral amines. This enzyme mediates a bond-forming reaction be- tween two substrates, one nucleophilic and one electrophilic. Previous work has almost exclusively focused on the activity of this enzyme with diverse nucleophilic substrates, for which TrpB has modest promiscuity. The research proposed here, by contrast, aims to expand the electrophilic substrate scope of the enzyme to make highly functionalized α-amino acids, as well as other classes of chiral amine such as amino alcohols and β-amino acids. The result of this research will be a new suite of biocatalysts that can be used to syn- thesize a wide range of chiral amine building blocks for the novel medicinal compounds essential for ad- vancing the diagnosis and treatment of human diseases. Project Narrative  The naturally occurring enzyme TrpB will be engineered to synthesize amino acids and chiral amines, which are ubiquitous precursors for bioactive compounds, both natural and synthetic. The results of this pro- ject will allow chemists and biologists direct access to these useful medicinal building blocks using a simple, efficient, and sustainable biocatalytic platform.",Development of a Biocatalytic Platform for Convergent Synthesis of Chiral Amines,9593457,R01GM125887,"['Acrylates ', ' Aldehyde-Lyases ', ' Aldolases ', ' Amines ', ' amine ', ' Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' Amino Alcohols ', ' aminoalcohol ', ' Transaminases ', ' Aminotransferases ', ' Antifungal Agents ', ' antifungals ', ' anti-fungal drug ', ' anti-fungal agents ', ' anti-fungal ', ' Therapeutic Fungicides ', ' Antifungal Drug ', ' Antineoplastic Agents ', ' anticancer drug ', ' anticancer agent ', ' anti-cancer drug ', ' Tumor-Specific Treatment Agents ', ' Neoplastic Disease Chemotherapeutic Agents ', ' Cancer Drug ', ' Antineoplastics ', ' Antineoplastic Drugs ', ' Anti-Cancer Agents ', ' Carbon ', ' chemical synthesis ', ' Dehydration ', ' body water dehydration ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Enzymes ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Health ', ' Homoserine ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Indoles ', ' Industry ', ' Production ', ' Propanolamines ', ' Aminopropanols ', ' Protein Engineering ', ' protein design ', ' genetic protein engineering ', ' Pyridoxal Phosphate ', ' Pyridoxal 5-Phosphate ', ' Reagent ', ' Research ', ' Solvents ', ' Threonine ', ' L-Threonine ', ' Tryptophan Synthase ', ' tryptophan desmolase ', ' Tryptophan Synthetase ', ' Tweens ', ' Work ', ' Mediating ', ' serine containing aminolipid ', ' serine-containing lipid ', ' Ser-L ', ' catalyst ', ' base ', ' carboxylate ', ' cofactor ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Active Sites ', ' analog ', ' enzyme activity ', ' antibacterial ', ' anti-bacterial ', ' Antibacterial Agents ', ' Anti-Bacterial Agents ', ' directed evolution ', ' Directed Molecular Evolution ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Complex ', ' Reaction ', ' Route ', ' interest ', ' empowered ', ' success ', ' thermostability ', ' thermolability ', ' Physical condensation ', ' condensation ', ' serinol ', ' 2-amino-1,3-propanediol ', ' novel ', ' Property ', ' drug discovery ', ' drug production ', ' Binding ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' Address ', ' Synthesis Chemistry ', ' Synthetic Chemistry ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' human disease ', ' novel lead compound ', ' ']",NIGMS,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2018,276802,CA-27,0.10335224810551871

"Quantifying NETosis via Automated High Content Imaging Convolutional Neural Networks PROJECT SUMMARY NETosis was identified as a distinct mode of cell death in neutrophils more than a decade ago. Dysregulation of NETosis has been implicated in the etiology of human pathologies such as preeclampsia, sickle cell disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, sepsis, cystic fibrosis, lupus nephritis, and coagulopathies that include cancer-associated thrombosis. The literature consistently cites the lack of a standardized methodology for quantitation of NETosis as an impediment to basic and translational research. Thus, the premise is that there is a compelling, unmet need for a standardized, quantitative and automated method for the measurement of NETosis to accelerate neutrophil and inflammation-based research and facilitate the discovery and development of therapeutic compounds. The scope of this STTR project is to develop a high-throughput image analysis and quantitation method by using high content imaging and the revolutionary technology of convolutional neural networks (CNN) for the identification and quantitation of NETosis in human neutrophils. The target readout is based on the primary morphological difference between NETotic and non-NETotic nuclei--the decondensation of chromatin. This image-based quantitative method will be observer-independent and will enable robust and rapid evaluation of a large number of samples that would exceed any attempts at manual assessment. In Phase I we will complete the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: Optimize and standardize the high- throughput platform for quantitation of NETosis in adherent human neutrophils. This includes standard assay optimization procedures, training the CNN to identify and quantitate NETotic neutrophil, and demonstrating that the CNN reliably distinguishes between necrosis and NETosis, whose phenotypes appear similar to the human eye. Aim 2: Validate the NETosis assay biochemically and clinically. This includes concentration-response assays with NETosis agonists, assessment of NETosis inhibitors, and evaluation of the NETotic status of Sickle Cell Disease patient samples (a disease in which aberrant NETosis has been implicated). The expected outcome of this Phase I effort is to demonstrate proof-of-concept for this automated high- throughput NETosis assay. Further, we expect to provide insight into the utility of the assay for assessment of inhibitors of NETosis as therapeutic agents. Upon completion of our Phase I aims, our Phase II program will focus on further optimizing and validating this NETosis assay and preparing it for commercialization.   PROJECT NARRATIVE Aberrant NETosis has been implicated in the etiology of several inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. The lack of a standardized, quantitative and automated method for the measurement of NETosis is impeding basic and translational research. We have developed a high-throughput assay using convolutional neural networks to quantify NETosis in human neutrophils.

"Biocomputation across distributed private datasets to enhance drug discovery Project Summary Collaborative Drug Discovery (CDD) proposes to develop technology that will vastly simplify and integrate all the processes required to exploit predictive models for drug discovery. The software will make it easy for scientists without specialized training in informatics to create, train, apply, evaluate, share, and archive models with minimal effort, and also leverage a large library of pre-computed models with zero effort. The software will also enable scientists working in different organizations to collectively build models from their aggregated data and share these models, without sharing the underlying training data.  Our goal is to democratize the role in drug discovery of computational models – which have historically been restricted to computational experts – and allow models to become routine aids to the discovery workflow in academia, foundations, government laboratories, and small companies that do not have the resources to employ them today. In Phase 2 we implemented modified Bayesian model building directly within CDD’s web- based CDD Vault platform, which securely hosts structure-activity relationship (SAR) data; any user can now easily train a Bayesian model with experimental data stored in her private Vault, then apply the model to predict activity for untested compounds. In Phase 2B we propose to generalize this capability with the following new Specific Aims, which are needed to achieve a widespread scientific and commercial impact: Aim 1: Integrate a suite of diverse computational techniques (such as QSAR, Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbors, and possibly others) into a single framework, to allow direct side-by-side comparison. Aim 2: Develop and validate a universal metric that ranks the predictive strength of each method as applied to a particular dataset. Aim 3: Apply the metric to automatically generate thousands of models from high-quality, public-access structure-activity and ADME/Tox datasets and present key results to the user.

"A Novel Test to Measure Latent Virus in HIV-1 Infected Patients Project Summary/Abstract  Human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) is a retrovirus that infects CD4+ T cells of the immune system. If left untreated, HIV-1 infected individuals will progress to AIDS and may ultimately die as a result. Combination antiretroviral therapy is extremely effective at stopping the replication of HIV-1 in infected individuals. Despite the success of this therapy at suppressing HIV-1 replication to clinically undetectable levels, antiretroviral therapy is not curative. This is due to the persistence of HIV-1 in a silent, or latent, state within a subset of CD4+ T cells known as resting memory CD4+ T cells. In this latent state, these infected cells are not targeted by antiretroviral drugs and cannot be eliminated by the immune system. In HIV-1 infected individuals, latently infected CD4+ T cells are found at extremely low frequencies (~1 per million resting memory CD4+ T cells). However, this population of latently infected cells is very stable, demanding that HIV-1 infected individuals remain on antiretroviral therapy indefinitely. Therefore, this population of latently infected CD4+ T cells is the main barrier to curing HIV-1 infection.  Developing strategies to eliminate latently infected cells is a major focus of the NIH, NIAID, and the HIV-1 research field. To demonstrate the efficacy of therapeutics targeting the latent reservoir, we must be able to measure the frequency of latently infected cells using rapid and accurate assays that can be scaled for widespread clinical use. However, such assays are not currently available. Accelevir Diagnostics, LLC is therefore developing a new molecular assay to accurately measure the size of the latent reservoir by quantifying the number of intact, replication competent proviruses present in CD4+ T cells from HIV-1 infected patients. Broadly, this proposal aims to define critical assay kit controls, perform analytical validation studies, benchmark our novel assay against available research assays for latent HIV-1, collect baseline data from HIV-1 infected individuals on suppressive therapy, produce commercial prototype kits for beta testing, and develop a data analysis framework for assay readouts and associated clinical metadata. The overall goals of this proposal are to complete development of our commercial test for latent HIV-1 and collect the foundational performance data needed to enable market entry. ! Project Narrative  For HIV-1 infected individuals on suppressive antiretroviral therapy, latent HIV-1 infection of resting memory CD4+ T cells is the major barrier to a cure. Elimination of these latently infected cells by has been proposed as a strategy to cure infected individuals. This proposal details the development and optimization of a new molecular assay to measure the number of latently infected cells in patients by Accelevir Diagnostics, for use in monitoring the efficacy of HIV-1 cure therapies.",A Novel Test to Measure Latent Virus in HIV-1 Infected Patients,9466048,R44AI124996,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Adoption ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Cell Line ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV-1 ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus 1 ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 ', ' HIV1 ', ' HIV-I ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' Infection ', ' Mining ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Legal patent ', ' Patents ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Production ', ' Proviruses ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Rest ', ' Retroviridae ', ' Virus-Retrovirus ', ' Retroviruses ', ' Specificity ', ' T-Lymphocyte ', ' thymus derived lymphocyte ', ' Thymus-Dependent Lymphocytes ', ' T-Cells ', ' CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes ', ' T4 Lymphocytes ', ' T4 Cells ', ' CD4-Positive Lymphocytes ', ' CD4+ T-Lymphocyte ', ' CD4 lymphocyte ', ' CD4 helper T cell ', ' CD4 T cells ', ' CD4 Cells ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Virus ', ' General Viruses ', ' Measures ', ' Infection Control ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Left ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Viral Latency ', ' Virus Latency ', ' Individual ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' Data Quality ', ' Measurement ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Life ', ' Frequencies ', ' Viral ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Disease remission ', ' Remission ', ' experience ', ' human data ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Anti-Retroviral Agents ', ' antiretroviral ', ' anti-retroviral ', ' Antiretroviral Agents ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' validation studies ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Sampling ', ' Adverse effects ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Interruption ', ' National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease ', ' NIAID ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' Clinical Virology ', ' Latent Virus ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' meta data ', ' Metadata ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' digital ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' memory CD4 T cell ', ' memory CD4 T lymphocyte ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Population ', ' Cellular model ', ' Cell model ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' early therapy ', ' Early treatment ', ' therapeutic target ', ' prototype ', ' commercialization ', ' phase II study ', ' phase 2 study ', ' Regimen ', ' transgene cassette ', ' transcriptional cassette ', ' transcription cassette ', ' stop cassette ', ' selection cassette ', ' selectable cassette ', ' resistance cassette ', ' reporter cassette ', ' promoter cassette ', ' integration cassette ', ' genetic cassette ', ' gene cassette ', ' expression cassette ', ' enhancer cassette ', ' DNA cassette ', ' reference assembly ', ' reference genome ', ' Virus reservoir ', ' Viral reservoir ', ' virus rebound ', ' viral rebound ', ' persistent infection ', ' chronic infection ', ' acute infection ', ' ']",NIAID,"ACCELEVIR DIAGNOSTICS, LLC",R44,2018,1000000,MD-03,0.009644299179463797
"Next Generation Testing Strategies for Assessment of Genotoxicity Project Summary  It is well recognized that current batteries of genetic toxicology assays exhibit two critical deficiencies. First, the throughput capacity of in vitro mammalian cell genotoxicity tests is low, and does not meet current needs. Second, conventional assays provide simplistic binary calls, genotoxic or non-genotoxic. In this scheme there is little or no consideration for potency, and virtually no information is provided about molecular targets and mechanisms. These deficiencies in hazard characterization prevent genotoxicity data from optimally contributing to modern risk assessments, where this information is essential. We will address these major problems with current in vitro mammalian cell genetic toxicity assays by developing methods and associated commercial assay kits that dramatically enhance throughput capacity, and delineate genotoxicants' primary molecular targets, while simultaneously providing information about potency. Once biomarkers and a family of multiplexed assays have been developed for these purposes, an interlaboratory trial will be performed with prototype assay kits to assess the transferability of the methods. Project Narrative  DNA damage that cannot be faithfully repaired results in gene mutation and/or chromosomal aberrations, and these effects are known to contribute to cancer and other severe diseases. Thus, there is an important need for sensitive assays to evaluate chemicals for genotoxic and other deleterious effects. The work proposed herein will address issues that have plagued genotoxicity assessments for the last several decades: low throughput, lack of potency metrics, and little to no information about molecular targets.

"Centralized assay datasets for modelling support of small drug discovery organizations Project Summary We have recently used computational models to identify the protease inhibitor indinavir (used as an antiviral for HIV) as a positive allosteric modulator at the α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. We now propose to build on this discovery as well as other publications describing compounds that are positive allosteric modulators of the α7- nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. We propose identifying further compounds that possess activity against this or one of 9 other targets implicated in Alzheimer’s disease using a combination of Bayesian machine learning and in vitro assays. Generating such data will enable us to potentially provide more specific compounds as well as building datasets that can be used to build predictive models to identify additional compounds with activity at these Alzheimer’s targets. These combined efforts should in the first instance provide commercially viable treatments which will be used to experimentally validate our computational models that can be shared with the Alzheimer’s disease scientific community. We are proposing to build and validate models based on public databases, select compounds for testing and use the data generated as a starting point for further optimization. Project Narrative Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders that causes dementia and it is characterized by amyloid deposition of a 39-42 AA peptide (Aβ) processed from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT). Many palliative drugs are available for the disease but there is still an urgent need for curative drugs with greater efficacy. We need to understand the key factors involved in disease progression and their suitability as drug targets for discovering new drugs against Alzheimer's disease. We hence propose to study several of these targets for Alzheimer’s disease involving all the key steps in the pathway, including several old and new targets.

"MegaTrans – human transporter machine learning models Summary Being able to predict interactions with important human transporters would be of value to new drug design to avoid compounds that interact with them and cause undesirable side effects. OATP1B1 (SLCO1B1) and OATP1B3 (SLCO1B3) are `uptake' transporters largely restricted to the sinusoidal aspect of hepatocytes. They both transport a wide variety of structurally-unrelated compounds, including members of several clinically im- portant drug families such as statins, sartans and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. We now propose to test over 1000 drugs against 2 substrates for each transporter in vitro. We will then use these data to curate and validate machine learning models. We will also use an array of machine learning methods as well as multiple model evaluation metrics. This will enable us to develop a web-based software tool called MegaTrans that will encourage the user to input their own compound structures and generate predictions for interactions with transporter/s of interest and then visualize the similarity to the training set of each model using several different visualization methods. The return on investment of such a tool would be that it could assist in the design and selection of more favorable compounds that avoid transporters of interest while also saving time and money. It could also identify compounds that are already approved that might present a drug interaction risk. Predicting such behavior seen in vivo is ideal and will lead to the prioritization of compounds to test in vitro for potential drug-drug interactions. In Phase II we would greatly expand the number of transporters which we would generate data on and build models such that we could address all the major transporters of interest to drug discovery. Narrative The objective of “MegaTrans” is to develop a new computational system and tools for integrating human trans- porter data into drug discovery pipelines, as well as enabling its analysis and visualization. This will then enable improved computational tool development for in vitro to in vivo extrapolation of xenobiotic exposures across a range of assay types. It will also assist with developing computational tools for quantitatively modeling drug-drug interactions of xenobiotics. Across Phase I and Phase II we will generate data for transporters which currently have a paucity of data in the public domain, use validated machine learning algorithms, access the latest curated datasets and develop a user intuitive interface and visualization system to enable predictions.",MegaTrans – human transporter machine learning models,9768844,R41GM131433,"['Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors ', ' Kininase II Inhibitors ', ' Kininase II Antagonists ', ' Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Antagonists ', ' Angiotensin I-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors ', ' ACE Inhibitors ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Behavior ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Communities ', ' Drug Preparation ', ' Drug Compounding ', ' Drug Design ', ' Drug Modelings ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Therapeutic Estradiol ', ' Progynon ', ' Ovocylin ', ' Ovocyclin ', ' Estraldine ', ' Estradiol-17beta ', ' Estradiol-17 beta ', ' Estrace ', ' Diogynets ', ' Diogyn ', ' Dimenformon ', ' Aquadiol ', ' Estradiol ', ' Family ', ' Fingerprint ', ' Goals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' In Vitro ', ' Industry ', ' Investments ', ' Kinetics ', ' Libraries ', ' Literature ', ' Methods ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' Receiver Operator Characteristics ', ' Receiver Operating Characteristics ', ' Risk ', ' Savings ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Software Tools ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Trees ', ' Work ', ' Xenobiotics ', ' Fluorescein ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Public Domains ', ' Imagery ', ' Visualization ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Hepatocyte ', ' Liver Cells ', ' Hepatic Parenchymal Cell ', ' Hepatic Cells ', ' Intuition ', ' Bayesian Method ', ' Bayesian posterior distribution ', ' Bayesian classification procedure ', ' Bayesian classification method ', ' Bayesian approaches ', ' Bayesian Statistical Method ', ' Bayesian Methodology ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Licensing ', ' uptake ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' Structure ', ' member ', ' Drug Interactions ', ' Glucuronides ', ' Modeling ', ' high throughput screening ', ' High Throughput Assay ', ' software development ', ' developing computer software ', ' develop software ', ' drug discovery ', ' Organic Cation Transporter ', ' POU2F2 gene ', ' POU2F2 ', ' OTF2 ', ' OCT2 ', ' Address ', ' Academia ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' in vivo ', ' Collection ', ' Characteristics ', ' Output ', ' PubChem ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' prospective ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new drugs ', ' new drug treatments ', ' tool development ', ' in vitro testing ', ' drug candidate ', ' model building ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' Natural Products ', ' human model ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' side effect ', ' ']",NIGMS,"COLLABORATIONS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.",R41,2019,210712,NC-02,0.10386759373220061
"Centralized assay datasets for modelling support of small drug discovery organizations Project Summary The growing importance of artificial intelligence (AI) is visible by the growth in companies and increasing deals over the past year between pharma and smaller companies using machine learning to assist in drug discovery. The continuing steady growth of structure-activity data for diverse targets, diseases and molecular properties poses a considerable challenge as they are generally not readily accessible for machine learning: content resides in a mixture of public databases (with differing levels of curation), disparate files within research groups, non- curated literature publications. In Phase I, Collaborations Pharmaceuticals Inc. developed a prototype of Assay Central software and used this with a wide variety of structure activity data from sources both public and private, formatted and unformatted, for enabling neglected, rare or common disease targets. Public data was mixed with collaborator/customer-contributed data, using original software and applied chemistry judgment of an expert team. In Phase I we created error checking and correction software. We also built and validated Bayesian models with the datasets that were collected and cleaned. And, in addition, we developed new data visualization tools. The software environment that we created readily enables the user to compile structure-activity data for building computational models and can be used to create selections of these models for sharing with collaborators as needed. This software can in turn be used for scoring new molecules and visualizing the multiple outputs in various formats. We have enabled ~14 collaborative projects which have shared models on specific targets such as PyrG for Tuberculosis (identifying a lead compound), HIV reverse transcriptase, whole cell screening for Leishmaniasis as well as P450 and nuclear receptor models (e.g. estrogen receptor) relevant to toxicology. We have utilized Assay Central in our ongoing internal projects working on Ebola, HIV and tuberculosis small molecule drug discovery. In Phase II, we propose the following aims that will enable us to develop Assay Central into a production tool for enabling drug discovery collaborations which we will continue to focus on. In Phase 1 we performed a preliminary analysis of different machine learning algorithms with select drug discovery datasets. In Phase II we will now perform a thorough evaluation and selection of additional machine learning algorithms and molecular descriptors as well as assessment of combination of algorithms (e.g. Bayesian and Deep Learning). We will implement disease/target definitions for machine learning models to facilitate drug discovery. We will enable molecule selection and automated design and optimization. The utility of having such a tool as Assay Central readily available will empower scientists to leverage public, private or a combination of data to help with their drug discovery tasks. Developing this software suite of computational models with public data will enable us to identify foundations, academics and potential collaborators that generate preliminary data to test models. These efforts will dramatically increase the number of projects we can work on, create new IP, and generate employment using machine learning focused on drug discovery in the area of rare and neglected diseases, in particular. Assay Central benefits include 1. Ease of deployment and use with a Java file executed by users without the need for IT support; 2. Built on industry standard technologies; 3. Graphical display of models provides instant feedback; 4 Model applicability with multiple methods to assess scores and graphics.

The software environment that we created readily enables us to compile structure-activity data for building computational models, can be used to create selections of these models for sharing with collaborators and has been used successfully to find promising lead compounds for many collaborators. We now propose in Phase II to optimize the underlying machine learning algorithms and molecular descriptors (e.g. combining Bayesian and Deep Learning), linking potentially thousands of rare and neglected diseases to the machine learning models, and automating molecule selection and new molecule design to enable further high value drug discovery collaborations with Assay Central.",Centralized

"MegaTox for analyzing and visualizing data across different screening systems Project Summary Computational toxicology aims to use rules, models and algorithms based on prior data for specific endpoints, to enable the prediction of whether a new molecule will possess similar liabilities or not. In some cases, the computational models are derived from discrete molecular endpoints while in others they are quite broad in scope. Considerable progress has been made in computational toxicology in a decade both in model development and availability such that the next generation of larger scale models will promote it to the next level and further focus in vitro and in vivo testing on verification of select predictions. Pharmaceutical, consumer products and other chemistry focused companies possess structure-activity data generated over many decades of screening that is not in the public domain, and this data is primarily only accessible to the cheminformatics experts in each company. Outside of these companies small biotechs and academics must rely on data from public databases, commercial databases and their own data. Integrating such data and processing it to build algorithms that can help with predictive models is a vast undertaking. Our recent efforts have used sources like PubChem and ChEMBL to build predictive models for different toxicity related and drug discovery endpoints. Drug companies tend to focus on target related information whereas there might be an opportunity to understand toxicity also. Our work with a consumer product company indicated the need for accessing machine learning models based on the growing public datasets could be a commercially viable product. Without massive legacy internal data many of small drug discovery and consumer product companies will have to make do with data accessible in PubChem, ChEMBL or other public databases (ToxCast, Tox21 etc) only. In this proposal we will provide toxicity machine learning models developed with different algorithms (Bayesian, Support vector machines, random forest and Deep Neural Networks as just some examples) for 40-50 in vitro and in vivo datasets. We are not aware of any other company pursuing such an approach to create as wide an array of toxicity models. We are also not aware of other software companies in the toxicity model space generating their own experimental data to test the models. Such a technology could have very broad utility for other pharmaceutical companies, biotechs, consumer product companies, regulatory groups and academic research groups. As we have been working for several years to build up technologies and experience in cheminformatics and software development it would be relatively straightforward for us to build the core foundations of MegaTox and deliver them to potential customers. This technology will also be used in our consulting projects with pharmaceutical and consumer product companies. Project Narrative The objective of ‘MegaTox’ is to develop a new computational system and tools for integrating toxicity data, and machine learning models. This will enable the prediction of various toxicity endpoints relevant to pharmaceutical and consumer product companies. We will use the latest machine learning algorithms, access the latest curated public datasets and develop a user intuitive interface and visualization system. We will use MegaTox internally for our own drug discovery projects as well as leverage it for consulting for clients so we can combine public and private datasets and increase the coverage of chemical property space.

"Development of a Biocatalytic Platform for Convergent Synthesis of Chiral Amines Project Abstract  The protection of human health depends on the continued discovery of biologically active compounds and their development into useful pharmaceuticals. Historically, synthetic chemistry has enabled medicinal chemists to create and optimize novel lead compounds and has empowered process chemists to produce compounds at the scale necessary for the treatment of a population. The processes of drug discovery and drug production are undergoing a dramatic change with the development of efficient enzyme catalysts as practical tools for synthesis. Medicinal chemists are now harnessing the promiscuous activities of enzymes to access in a single step medicinally relevant compounds that otherwise require multiple-step chemical syntheses. Further, process chemists are starting to leverage the unrivalled efficiency and inherent sustain- ability of enzymes to replace the expensive catalysts and the toxic reagents and solvents that characterize many current production routes. As a result, enzymes are rapidly becoming important tools for pharmaceu- tical synthesis.  These transformative developments are unfortunately limited by the relative dearth of useful synthetic reactions in the ‘biocatalytic toolbox’. Our group has made fundamental advances to expanding this toolbox by using directed evolution to obtain new, useful biocatalysts starting from enzymes whose activities may have been low or even undetectable for the desired substrate or reaction.  This proposal seeks to expand and generalize a powerful biocatalytic platform for the synthesis of chiral amines. Such compounds are prevalent as building blocks for pharmaceuticals that encompass all realms of human health such as antibacterial, antifungal, and anticancer drugs. The ability to improve upon these compounds is dependent on access to suitable building blocks. We have identified the enzyme TrpB as a unique biocatalyst for the synthesis of chiral amines. This enzyme mediates a bond-forming reaction be- tween two substrates, one nucleophilic and one electrophilic. Previous work has almost exclusively focused on the activity of this enzyme with diverse nucleophilic substrates, for which TrpB has modest promiscuity. The research proposed here, by contrast, aims to expand the electrophilic substrate scope of the enzyme to make highly functionalized α-amino acids, as well as other classes of chiral amine such as amino alcohols and β-amino acids. The result of this research will be a new suite of biocatalysts that can be used to syn- thesize a wide range of chiral amine building blocks for the novel medicinal compounds essential for ad- vancing the diagnosis and treatment of human diseases. Project Narrative  The naturally occurring enzyme TrpB will be engineered to synthesize amino acids and chiral amines, which are ubiquitous precursors for bioactive compounds, both natural and synthetic. The results of this pro- ject will allow chemists and biologists direct access to these useful medicinal building blocks using a simple, efficient, and sustainable biocatalytic platform.",Development of a Biocatalytic Platform for Convergent Synthesis of Chiral Amines,9720905,R01GM125887,"['Acrylates ', ' Aldehyde-Lyases ', ' Aldolases ', ' Amines ', ' amine ', ' Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' Amino Alcohols ', ' aminoalcohol ', ' Transaminases ', ' Aminotransferases ', ' Antifungal Agents ', ' antifungals ', ' anti-fungal drug ', ' anti-fungal agents ', ' anti-fungal ', ' Therapeutic Fungicides ', ' Antifungal Drug ', ' Antineoplastic Agents ', ' anticancer drug ', ' anticancer agent ', ' anti-cancer drug ', ' Tumor-Specific Treatment Agents ', ' Neoplastic Disease Chemotherapeutic Agents ', ' Cancer Drug ', ' Antineoplastics ', ' Antineoplastic Drugs ', ' Anti-Cancer Agents ', ' Carbon ', ' chemical synthesis ', ' body water dehydration ', ' Dehydration ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Enzymes ', ' Health ', ' Homoserine ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Indoles ', ' Industry ', ' Production ', ' Aminopropanols ', ' Propanolamines ', ' protein design ', ' genetic protein engineering ', ' Protein Engineering ', ' Pyridoxal 5-Phosphate ', ' Pyridoxal Phosphate ', ' Reagent ', ' Research ', ' Solvents ', ' L-Threonine ', ' Threonine ', ' tryptophan desmolase ', ' Tryptophan Synthetase ', ' Tryptophan Synthase ', ' Tweens ', ' Work ', ' Mediating ', ' serine-containing lipid ', ' Ser-L ', ' serine containing aminolipid ', ' catalyst ', ' base ', ' carboxylate ', ' cofactor ', ' improved ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Active Sites ', ' analog ', ' enzyme activity ', ' Anti-Bacterial Agents ', ' antibacterial ', ' anti-bacterial ', ' Antibacterial Agents ', ' Directed Molecular Evolution ', ' directed evolution ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Complex ', ' Reaction ', ' Route ', ' interest ', ' empowered ', ' success ', ' thermostability ', ' thermolability ', ' Physical condensation ', ' condensation ', ' serinol ', ' 2-amino-1,3-propanediol ', ' novel ', ' Property ', ' drug discovery ', ' drug production ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' Address ', ' Synthesis Chemistry ', ' Synthetic Chemistry ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' human disease ', ' novel lead compound ', ' ']",NIGMS,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2019,291940,CA-27,0.10335224810551871
"Multiplexed high-content assay for toxicity profiling using live iPSC-derived cardiomyocyte lines with lineage-specific barcoding Project Summary/Abstract Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are poised to transform toxicological evaluation, however new approaches to enable their functional and structural profiling are needed to improve the utility of hiPSC -based models for predictive and mechanistic toxicology screening. This need is addressed by our project’s Specific Aims that encompass (1) development of a novel platform for generation of hiPSC-derived reporter cells; (2) generation of a panel of multicolor hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) with stable lineage specific fluorescent reporters; and (3) implementation and validation of a pilot machine learning-enabled predictive cardiotoxicity screen using these tools. The proposed tools are configured to be extensible to other toxicology- relevant pathways and phenotypes making it uniquely positioned to capitalize on the growing commercial need for high-throughput predictive toxicology assays. The project deliverables benefit public health by improving the ability to rapidly identify liabilities in specific cardiomyocyte lineage types, thus reducing the time and cost to pinpoint cardiotoxicity of pharmaceutical and environmental chemicals. Project Narrative The assay and reagents established in the course of this project directly address the goals of significant initiatives to improve the effectiveness of cardiotoxicity testing, such as the FDA’s CiPA initiative and the work of the Cardiac Safety Research Consortium. The resulting improvements in the pace and precision of drug testing will result in public health benefit through the development of more cost-effective and safer medicines.

"MegaPredict for predicting natural product uses and their drug interactions Project Summary The objective of ‘MegaPredict’ is to enable scientists to generate predictions for a natural product (or any molecule) and identify targets for efficacy assessment as well as identify any potential liabilities. We are building on our previous work which has compiled a comprehensive collection of datasets for structure-activity data for a broad variety of disease targets and other properties, in a form ready for model building. All of these models utilize the many sources of curated open data, including ChEMBL, ToxCast etc. We have developed a prototype of MegaPredict that utilizes Bayesian algorithm and ECFP6 fingerprints to output a list of prioritized ‘targets’. We realize that neither the algorithm or the descriptors may be optimal therefore we propose to address this as we validate MegaPredict and develop a product over this proposal. Our team is suitably qualified to develop the software needed and we will leverage our large collaborator network to assist us in validating the activity of compounds. We will initially create a script to take a natural product and score it against many thousands of machine learning models then rank the outputs to propose efficacy targets. We will use over 12,000 ChEMBL derived target-assay / bioactivity groups extracted from the ChEMBL v24 database, as well as EPA Tox21 measurements and other public datasets, using methodology that we have already partially developed. We can repeat this process for over 200 published compounds and access the outputs versus what is known. We intend to compare how the approach performs with synthetic drugs or drug-like compounds as well as natural products. We will assess whether other machine learning algorithms and molecular descriptors can improve predictions. As we generate machine learning models such as Linear Logistic Regression, AdaBoost Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and deep neural networks (DNN) of varying depth we will assess the predictions for natural products and compare with the Bayesian approach. We will compare ECFP6 with other 2D, 3D descriptors and physicochemical properties in order to identify the optimal combination for generating predictions for natural products and compare how this differs for synthetic compounds. We will validate our predictions for natural product efficacy assessment. We will work closely with multiple academic groups to generate predictions for at least 20 natural products of interest against over 20 different targets or diseases. Our goal will be to identify potential targets that were previously unknown and then generate in vitro data inhouse or with academic collaborators. Develop a prototype user interface for input of a structure, processing an input molecule and output of prioritized targets and liabilities. We have developed multiple software prototypes (e. Assay Central, MegaTox, etc.) previously and will ensure a user-friendly interface and develop new visualization methods and algorithms for prioritizing potential predicted targets based on the outputs of thousands of machine learning models. In Phase I, we will use the software internally with collaborators to rapidly prototype it. In Phase II we will develop a commercial product, and greatly expand our validation by building a larger network of academic and industry partners that would help to prioritize features of most relevance. Using the machine learning models which we have for natural products is limited because ECFP6 fingerprints cannot distinguish between these very different classes of molecules. But this provides us with an opportunity by going for a ""pharmacophore"" style approach (ideally without using 3D conformations directly). We will therefore focus on developing a ‘3D shape-based fingerprint’ or developing a novel ‘2D fingerprint’ that captures the ‘3D shape’ for natural- and druglike molecules. Currently, the public datasets in ChEMBL and PubChem etc. are made up of mostly druglike molecules, but if we have fingerprints that can compare drug-like and natural product-like molecules then we can likely reliably use our MegaPredict models for natural products as well. We can also attempt to rank natural products with our ChEMBL models or we can look through catalogs of druglike compounds using models derived from natural products. That would be an important innovation. Additionally, in Phase II it would be important to see if we could find uses for natural products with any of the 7000 rare diseases. Developing software that predicts potential natural product drug interactions with various targets could be useful to regulatory organizations as well as the pharmaceutical industry and may broaden utility of being able to more effectively mix natural product and druglike compounds in models will have a profound effect on the value of cheminformatics in this arena. Project Narrative Natural products have long been a source of therapeutics for human healthcare. Yet, some of the challenges with developing natural product treatments are identifying potential human disease related targets and avoiding others that might lead to undesirable natural product-drug interactions. Now there is considerable data in the public domain for millions of molecules with thousands of targets and ADME/T related properties that it is possible to use a suite of machine learning models for prospective prediction and profiling of a molecule’s properties from structure alone. We aim to build on our preliminary efforts to date to create a prototype for MegaPredict using various machine learning models which will enable academic and industrial scientists to generate predictions for a natural product or any molecule of interest and identify potential targets for efficacy and toxicity liability assessment. We will experimentally validate these predictions in-house or through our network of collaborators.",MegaPredict for predicting natural product uses and their drug interactions,9846761,R43AT010585,"['Algorithms ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Chemistry ', ' Decision Trees ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Pharmaceutical Industry ', ' Pharmaceutic Industry ', ' Drug Industry ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Fingerprint ', ' Goals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' In Vitro ', ' Industrialization ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Literature ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Chemical Models ', ' conformational state ', ' conformation ', ' Molecular Stereochemistry ', ' Molecular Configuration ', ' Molecular Conformation ', ' Phenotype ', ' Transphosphorylases ', ' Phosphotransferase Gene ', ' Kinases ', ' Phosphotransferases ', ' Publishing ', ' Running ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Software Tools ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Public Domains ', ' Imagery ', ' Visualization ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Ensure ', ' Bayesian Method ', ' Bayesian posterior distribution ', ' Bayesian classification procedure ', ' Bayesian classification method ', ' Bayesian approaches ', ' Bayesian Statistical Method ', ' Bayesian Methodology ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Measurement ', ' Descriptor ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Catalogs ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' 3D ', ' 3-D ', ' Viral ', ' interest ', ' pharmacophore ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Toxicities ', ' Rare Diseases ', ' orphan disorder ', ' Rare Disorder ', ' Orphan Disease ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' G-Protein-Coupled Receptors ', ' GPCR ', ' G Protein-Coupled Receptor Genes ', ' G Protein-Complex Receptor ', ' Drug Interactions ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' software development ', ' developing computer software ', ' develop software ', ' drug discovery ', ' chemical informatics ', ' cheminformatics ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Natural Product Drug ', ' in vivo ', ' Collection ', ' Validation ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Output ', ' PubChem ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' process repeatability ', ' process reproducibility ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' user-friendly ', ' web interface ', ' human disease ', ' commercial application ', ' prototype ', ' industry partner ', ' industry partnership ', ' industrial partnership ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' synthetic drug ', ' model building ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' Natural Products ', ' open data ', ' open-source data ', ' open science ', ' predictive tools ', ' web-based tool ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' random forest ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' Bayesian learning ', ' Bayesian machine learning ', ' ']",NCCIH,"COLLABORATIONS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.",R43,2019,68862,NC-02,0.03958024220854181
"Development of a novel pharmaco-EEG based, high-throughput screening platform to facilitate drug discovery for psychiatric disorders PROJECT SUMMARY The high rate of failure in CNS drug discovery, in particular of the first-in-class therapeutics with new modes of action, highlights a clear unmet need to improve the success rate in drug discovery for psychiatric disorders. One well-known issue is the poor ability of current bioassays and animal models to predict the efficacy and side-effects of compounds. In response, there is a steady growth in the use of electroencephalogram (EEG) in clinical trials in recent years. Pharmaceutical companies are incorporating EEG more often in their preclinical drug discovery efforts because the high degree of translatability of EEG from rodents to humans makes it ideal to use in de-risking programs in drug discovery. Moreover, quantitative EEG (qEEG) is an objective measurement of brain activity with a high test-retest reliability and considerable predictive, face, and construct validity. Additionally, well-documented literature shows that certain classes of drugs elicit different EEG fingerprints, suggesting that EEG yields pharmaco-dynamic signatures specific to pharmacological action and can be used to enable classification of drugs based on the effects of the EEG. Further, EEG can be used to rapidly screen compounds for potential activity at specific pharmacological targets and provide valuable information for guiding the early stages of drug development. However, to date, no EEG-based tool is broadly available to be used to predict the therapeutic utility of unknown compounds for drug discovery in psychiatric disorders. In order to develop such a tool, PsychoGenics, Inc., is leveraging our existing expertise in performing high-throughput pharmaco-sleep-EEG studies and our established proprietary machine learning approach to develop a novel EEG-based drug discovery platform that can predict therapeutic indications or underlying mechanism of action (MOA; i.e. the neurotransmitter system/receptor targets) of unknown compounds for psychiatric disorders. Our aims are 1) to generate a quantitative electroencephalogram (QEEG) database of compounds with a known mechanism and therapeutic value in mice, and 2) to develop a classifier using supervised machine learning. The success of this Phase I SBIR project will result in a novel EEG-based drug discovery platform that can predict therapeutic indications and MOA of new compounds based on their EEG profiles. In a future Phase II project, we will 1) add in auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) database, 2) test our EEGCube by conducting a phenotypic drug discovery project with our established collaborator (see letters of support), 3) investigate whether integrating the EEGcube database with our SmartCube® database of same compounds helps better understand the circuitry responsible for behavioral responses and/or achieves even greater prediction power in identifying therapeutic indication of novel compounds and 4) explore EEG signatures of transgenic mouse models of disease and investigate use of their signatures to identify potential therapies for the respective diseases based on EEG. PROJECT NARRATIVE There is an unmet need to improve success rate in drug discovery for psychiatric disorders due to the high rate of failure. Given the high degree of translatability of electroencephalogram (EEG) from rodents to humans, PsychoGenics, Inc., proposes to develop a novel EEG-based drug discovery platform that can predict therapeutic indications, underlying mechanism of action, and/or compound liabilities to guide the early stages of drug development.","Development of a novel pharmaco-EEG based, high-throughput screening platform to facilitate drug discovery for psychiatric disorders",9846025,R43MH121136,"['Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' CNS disorder ', ' CNS Diseases ', ' Central Nervous System Diseases ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' EEG ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' Auditory Evoked Response ', ' Auditory Evoked Potentials ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Fingerprint ', ' Future ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Libraries ', ' Literature ', ' Methods ', ' Transgenic Mice ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' Nerve Transmitter Substances ', ' Neurotransmitters ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Rat ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Rattus ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Rest ', ' Rights ', ' Risk ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodent ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Sleep ', ' Sleep Stages ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Neuroleptics ', ' Neuroleptic Drugs ', ' Neuroleptic Agents ', ' Major Tranquilizing Agents ', ' Major Tranquilizers ', ' Antipsychotics ', ' Antipsychotic Drugs ', ' Antipsychotic Agents ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Ensure ', ' Failure ', ' insight ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Measurement ', ' Letters ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Frequencies ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' drug classification ', ' Performance ', ' receptor ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' success ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' Pharmacologic Actions ', ' novel ', ' Disease model ', ' disorder model ', ' Pharmacodynamics ', ' response ', ' drug development ', ' high throughput screening ', ' High Throughput Assay ', ' drug discovery ', ' Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' Brain region ', ' Dose ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' SBIR ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electroencephalogram ', ' Behavioral ', ' Output ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' behavioral response ', ' behavior response ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' side effect ', ' pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics ', ' PK/PD ', ' ']",NIMH,"PSYCHOGENICS, INC.",R43,2019,449973,NJ-05,0.08211328472806971
"West Coast Metabolomics Center for Compound Identification Project Summary – Overall West Coast Metabolomics Center for Compound Identification (WCMC) The West Coast Metabolomics Center for Compound Identification (WCMC) is committed to the overall goals of the NIH Common Fund Metabolomics Initiative and specifically aims to largely improve small molecule identifications. Understanding metabolism is important to gain insight into biochemical processes and relevant to battle diseases such as cancer, obesity and diabetes. Compound identification in metabolomics is still a daunting task with many unknown compounds and false positive identifications. The major goal of the WCMC is therefore to develop processes and resources that accelerate and improve the accuracy of the compound identification workflow for experts and medical professionals. The WCMC for Compound Identification is structured in three different entities: the Administrative Core, the Computational Core and the Experimental Core. The Center is led by the Director Prof. Fiehn in close collaboration with quantum chemistry experts Prof. Wang and Prof. Tantillo, and metabolomics experts Dr. Barupal and Dr. Kind with broad support from mass spectrometry, computational metabolomics and programming experts. The Administrative Core will assist the Computational and Experimental Core to develop and validate large in-silico mass spectral libraries, retention time prediction models and innovative methods for constraining and ranking lists of isomers in an integrated process of cheminformatics tools and databases.

"West Coast Metabolomics Center for Compound Identification Project Summary – Overall West Coast Metabolomics Center for Compound Identification (WCMC) The West Coast Metabolomics Center for Compound Identification (WCMC) is committed to the overall goals of the NIH Common Fund Metabolomics Initiative and specifically aims to largely improve small molecule identifications. Understanding metabolism is important to gain insight into biochemical processes and relevant to battle diseases such as cancer, obesity and diabetes. Compound identification in metabolomics is still a daunting task with many unknown compounds and false positive identifications. The major goal of the WCMC is therefore to develop processes and resources that accelerate and improve the accuracy of the compound identification workflow for experts and medical professionals. The WCMC for Compound Identification is structured in three different entities: the Administrative Core, the Computational Core and the Experimental Core. The Center is led by the Director Prof. Fiehn in close collaboration with quantum chemistry experts Prof. Wang and Prof. Tantillo, and metabolomics experts Dr. Barupal and Dr. Kind with broad support from mass spectrometry, computational metabolomics and programming experts. The Administrative Core will assist the Computational and Experimental Core to develop and validate large in-silico mass spectral libraries, retention time prediction models and innovative methods for constraining and ranking lists of isomers in an integrated process of cheminformatics tools and databases.

"Development of a Biocatalytic Platform for Convergent Synthesis of Chiral Amines Project Abstract  The protection of human health depends on the continued discovery of biologically active compounds and their development into useful pharmaceuticals. Historically, synthetic chemistry has enabled medicinal chemists to create and optimize novel lead compounds and has empowered process chemists to produce compounds at the scale necessary for the treatment of a population. The processes of drug discovery and drug production are undergoing a dramatic change with the development of efficient enzyme catalysts as practical tools for synthesis. Medicinal chemists are now harnessing the promiscuous activities of enzymes to access in a single step medicinally relevant compounds that otherwise require multiple-step chemical syntheses. Further, process chemists are starting to leverage the unrivalled efficiency and inherent sustain- ability of enzymes to replace the expensive catalysts and the toxic reagents and solvents that characterize many current production routes. As a result, enzymes are rapidly becoming important tools for pharmaceu- tical synthesis.  These transformative developments are unfortunately limited by the relative dearth of useful synthetic reactions in the ‘biocatalytic toolbox’. Our group has made fundamental advances to expanding this toolbox by using directed evolution to obtain new, useful biocatalysts starting from enzymes whose activities may have been low or even undetectable for the desired substrate or reaction.  This proposal seeks to expand and generalize a powerful biocatalytic platform for the synthesis of chiral amines. Such compounds are prevalent as building blocks for pharmaceuticals that encompass all realms of human health such as antibacterial, antifungal, and anticancer drugs. The ability to improve upon these compounds is dependent on access to suitable building blocks. We have identified the enzyme TrpB as a unique biocatalyst for the synthesis of chiral amines. This enzyme mediates a bond-forming reaction be- tween two substrates, one nucleophilic and one electrophilic. Previous work has almost exclusively focused on the activity of this enzyme with diverse nucleophilic substrates, for which TrpB has modest promiscuity. The research proposed here, by contrast, aims to expand the electrophilic substrate scope of the enzyme to make highly functionalized α-amino acids, as well as other classes of chiral amine such as amino alcohols and β-amino acids. The result of this research will be a new suite of biocatalysts that can be used to syn- thesize a wide range of chiral amine building blocks for the novel medicinal compounds essential for ad- vancing the diagnosis and treatment of human diseases. Project Narrative  The naturally occurring enzyme TrpB will be engineered to synthesize amino acids and chiral amines, which are ubiquitous precursors for bioactive compounds, both natural and synthetic. The results of this pro- ject will allow chemists and biologists direct access to these useful medicinal building blocks using a simple, efficient, and sustainable biocatalytic platform.",Development of a Biocatalytic Platform for Convergent Synthesis of Chiral Amines,9995278,R01GM125887,"['Acrylates ', ' Aldehyde-Lyases ', ' Aldolases ', ' Amines ', ' amine ', ' Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' Amino Alcohols ', ' aminoalcohol ', ' Transaminases ', ' Aminotransferases ', ' Antifungal Agents ', ' antifungals ', ' anti-fungal drug ', ' anti-fungal agents ', ' anti-fungal ', ' Therapeutic Fungicides ', ' Antifungal Drug ', ' Antineoplastic Agents ', ' anticancer drug ', ' anticancer agent ', ' anti-cancer drug ', ' Tumor-Specific Treatment Agents ', ' Neoplastic Disease Chemotherapeutic Agents ', ' Cancer Drug ', ' Antineoplastics ', ' Antineoplastic Drugs ', ' Anti-Cancer Agents ', ' Carbon ', ' chemical synthesis ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Enzymes ', ' Health ', ' Homoserine ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Indoles ', ' Industry ', ' Kinetics ', ' Production ', ' Aminopropanols ', ' Propanolamines ', ' protein design ', ' genetic protein engineering ', ' Protein Engineering ', ' Pyridoxal 5-Phosphate ', ' Pyridoxal Phosphate ', ' Reagent ', ' Research ', ' L-Serine ', ' Serine ', ' Solvents ', ' backbone ', ' Spine ', ' Spinal Column ', ' Vertebral column ', ' L-Threonine ', ' Threonine ', ' Levotryptophan ', ' L-Tryptophan ', ' Tryptophan ', ' tryptophan desmolase ', ' Tryptophan Synthetase ', ' Tryptophan Synthase ', ' Tweens ', ' Work ', ' Mediating ', ' catalyst ', ' base ', ' carboxylate ', ' cofactor ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Active Sites ', ' analog ', ' enzyme activity ', ' Anti-Bacterial Agents ', ' antibacterial ', ' anti-bacterial ', ' Antibacterial Agents ', ' Directed Molecular Evolution ', ' directed evolution ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Complex ', ' Reaction ', ' Route ', ' interest ', ' empowered ', ' success ', ' thermostability ', ' thermolability ', ' Physical condensation ', ' condensation ', ' serinol ', ' 2-amino-1,3-propanediol ', ' novel ', ' Property ', ' drug discovery ', ' drug production ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' Hydration ', ' Hydration status ', ' CXCL11 gene ', ' b-R1 ', ' SCYB9B ', ' SCYB11 ', ' IP9 ', ' IP-9 ', ' I-TAC ', ' H174 ', ' CXCL11 ', ' Address ', ' Resolution ', ' Synthesis Chemistry ', ' Synthetic Chemistry ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' human disease ', ' novel lead compound ', ' ']",NIGMS,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2019,64234,CA-27,0.10335224810551871
"High-throughput profiling of compound abuse liabilities and identification of addiction-related drug targets using an iPSC-enabled platform Project Summary/Abstract The scale of the US opioid addiction crisis clearly evidences the critical need for breakthroughs to assess compound abuse liabilities and to enable discovery of new analgesics with minimal abuse potential. We hypothesize that altered addiction-associated physiology can be modeled in co-cultured hiPSC-derived neuronal and astrocyte cells and detected by profiling gene expression alterations and associated phenotypic readouts. Our proposal addresses the significant lack of physiologically-relevant tools capable of profiling relevant molecular changes that underpin addiction in the human nervous system by executing Specific Aims that encompass: (1) generation of a panel of multicolor hiPSC-derived neuronal and astrocyte cells with stable lineage specific fluorescent reporters; (2) execution of a phenotype-based pilot machine learning-enabled predictive abuse liability screen; and (3) combination of phenotypic profiling and gene expression analysis to characterize the molecular and cellular changes associated with compound exposure. Successful completion of our project will deliver 2 significant advances: (1) an important new technical framework to assess abuse potential of candidate therapeutics early in the development process and (2) an innovative, scalable in vitro assay platform that enables discovery of targets and associated candidate therapeutics to mitigate addiction phenotypes. These innovations will position Cairn Biosciences to initiate drug discovery programs that will bring significant societal benefit by helping to stem the growth of the US opioid crisis and reduce the mortality rates and economic burden associated with this National Emergency. Project Narrative The ongoing opioid addiction crisis clearly evidences the need for new approaches to overcome addiction and mitigate the abuse liabilities of new therapies, yet a critical barrier to progress is the lack of in vitro assays in human cells to profile the abuse liabilities of therapeutics. Our project will deliver an innovative in vitro assay platform that enables 1) the assessment of abuse liability of candidate therapeutics early in development and 2) the discovery of targets and associated candidate therapeutics to prevent development of an addiction phenotype. These high impact advances align with government priorities such as the NIH HEAL (Helping to End Addiction Long-term) initiative and will deliver significant additional benefit to public health by enabling identification of safer new therapeutics without addictive potential.",High-throughput profiling of compound abuse liabilities and identification of addiction-related drug targets using an iPSC-enabled platform,9912598,R44DA048686,"['Analgesics ', ' painkiller ', ' pain reliever ', ' pain medication ', ' pain killer ', ' Antinociceptive Drugs ', ' Antinociceptive Agents ', ' Anodynes ', ' Analgesic Preparation ', ' Analgesic Drugs ', ' Analgesic Agents ', ' Astrocytes ', ' astrocytic glia ', ' Astroglia ', ' Astrocytus ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Sciences ', ' Life Sciences ', ' Bioscience ', ' Biologic Sciences ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Emergencies ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Engineering ', ' Gene Expression ', ' glutamatergic ', ' L-Glutamate ', ' Glutamates ', ' Government ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' In Vitro ', ' Methods ', ' Microscopy ', ' mortality ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Neurologic Organ System ', ' Neurologic Body System ', ' Nervous System ', ' Nervous system structure ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physiology ', ' Public Health ', ' Specificity ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Transfection ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' promotor ', ' promoter ', ' base ', ' Phase ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Measurement ', ' Cell Lineage ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Reporter ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Opiate Addiction ', ' opioid dependent ', ' opioid dependence ', ' opioid addiction ', ' Opiate Dependence ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' expression vector ', ' Structure ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Gene Proteins ', ' Protein Gene Products ', ' Gene Expression Profiling ', ' transcriptional profiling ', ' gene expression assay ', ' gene expression analysis ', ' Transcript Expression Analysis ', ' Transcript Expression Analyses ', ' Gene Expression Pattern Analysis ', ' Gene Expression Monitoring ', ' dopaminergic neuron ', ' Dopamine neuron ', ' DA Neuron ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' Proteomics ', ' drug discovery ', ' Protein Array ', ' protein expression ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Economic Burden ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' molecular signature ', ' molecular profile ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' in vitro Assay ', ' in vitro Model ', ' Gene Expression Alteration ', ' Validation ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' vector ', ' healing ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new drugs ', ' new drug treatments ', ' stem ', ' induced pluripotent stem cell ', ' iPSCs ', ' iPSC ', ' iPS ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' novel therapy target ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' novel pharmacotherapy target ', ' novel druggable target ', ' novel drug target ', ' new therapy target ', ' new pharmacotherapy target ', ' new druggable target ', ' new drug target ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' multi-electrode arrays ', ' multielectrode arrays ', ' targeted biomarker ', ' transcriptome ', ' global transcription profile ', ' global gene expression ', ' therapeutic candidate ', ' opioid epidemic ', ' opioid crisis ', ' opiate crisis ', ' ']",NIDA,"CAIRN BIOSCIENCES, INC.",R44,2019,323750,CA-12,-0.00837212544032167
"Developing a systems biology platform for predicting, preventing, and treating drug side effects Project Summary Adverse drug reactions (ADRs), more commonly known as drug side effects, are estimated to cause over 200,000 deaths in the US annually, are responsible for 6.5% of all hospital admissions, and 28% of clinical trial failures. ADRs are estimated to increase healthcare costs by $136 billion per year in the USA alone. Current safety and modeling efforts that are commonly used in the pharma industry (such as PK/PD) do not elucidate the complex pathophysiology underlying ADRs. These safety and modeling approaches are used predominantly to quantitatively understand exposure-response relationships for clinical dosing, but with a few exceptions do not focus on the cellular pharmacodynamic mechanisms of why drugs cause ADRs. Elucidating the downstream and systemic effects of pharmaceuticals is critical to understanding ADR pathogenesis and developing safer therapies. Drugs can affect multiple proteins and each protein that they modulate may play roles in multiple cellular processes. Systems biology and bioinformatics approaches coupled with machine learning are crucial for understanding the multi-factorial pathophysiology of ADRs. In Phase I of this program, we developed an in vitro transcriptomics based computational platform that 1) predicts drug-side effect liability equivalent to current gold-standard approaches that require considerably more information about the compound and its effects, 2) defines genes that are relevant to ADR pathophysiology, and 3) identifies therapeutically beneficial compounds for the ADR. Based on the computational platform, we discovered a repurposing opportunity for an off-patent, non-FDA approved drug in Parkinson’s Disease that we are currently pursuing towards clinical development. This drug significantly improves levodopa’s efficacy, without exacerbating the drug’s major side effect which often precludes levodopa’s use. In Phase II of this proposal, we will continue to develop and expand the ADR computational platform. Further, we will hone our focus on two key clinically and commercially relevant ADRs: antipsychotic induced tardive dyskinesia and radio-/chemo- therapy induced mucosal inflammation. We will generate rich datasets for these ADRs to both validate our in vitro platform with in vivo data and to understand the pathophysiology of these ADRs at an unprecedented level. Further, we will use the datasets to generate computational predictions for discovering/repurposing drugs to improve safety in psychiatric and cancer treatments. The best predictions will be subsequently tested in vitro and developed through partnerships and external funding mechanisms. Project Narrative Adverse drug reactions, more commonly known as drug side effects, cause over 200,000 deaths in the US annually, are responsible for 6.5% of all hospital admissions, and 28% of clinical trial failures. This proposal will continue development and deploy a computational platform that predict drug side effects' mechanisms for safer drug development and better patient outcomes. The predictive platform will be applied for improving cancer and psychiatric treatments.","Developing a systems biology platform for predicting, preventing, and treating drug side

"A Novel Test to Measure Latent Virus in HIV-1 Infected Patients Project Summary/Abstract  Human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) is a retrovirus that infects CD4+ T cells of the immune system. If left untreated, HIV-1 infected individuals will progress to AIDS and may ultimately die as a result. Combination antiretroviral therapy is extremely effective at stopping the replication of HIV-1 in infected individuals. Despite the success of this therapy at suppressing HIV-1 replication to clinically undetectable levels, antiretroviral therapy is not curative. This is due to the persistence of HIV-1 in a silent, or latent, state within a subset of CD4+ T cells known as resting memory CD4+ T cells. In this latent state, these infected cells are not targeted by antiretroviral drugs and cannot be eliminated by the immune system. In HIV-1 infected individuals, latently infected CD4+ T cells are found at extremely low frequencies (~1 per million resting memory CD4+ T cells). However, this population of latently infected cells is very stable, demanding that HIV-1 infected individuals remain on antiretroviral therapy indefinitely. Therefore, this population of latently infected CD4+ T cells is the main barrier to curing HIV-1 infection.  Developing strategies to eliminate latently infected cells is a major focus of the NIH, NIAID, and the HIV-1 research field. To demonstrate the efficacy of therapeutics targeting the latent reservoir, we must be able to measure the frequency of latently infected cells using rapid and accurate assays that can be scaled for widespread clinical use. However, such assays are not currently available. Accelevir Diagnostics, LLC is therefore developing a new molecular assay to accurately measure the size of the latent reservoir by quantifying the number of intact, replication competent proviruses present in CD4+ T cells from HIV-1 infected patients. Broadly, this proposal aims to define critical assay kit controls, perform analytical validation studies, benchmark our novel assay against available research assays for latent HIV-1, collect baseline data from HIV-1 infected individuals on suppressive therapy, produce commercial prototype kits for beta testing, and develop a data analysis framework for assay readouts and associated clinical metadata. The overall goals of this proposal are to complete development of our commercial test for latent HIV-1 and collect the foundational performance data needed to enable market entry. !

"Novel Methodology for Identification of Senolytics that Reduce Age-related Disease and Dysfunction DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic diseases of aging account for a significant proportion of healthcare spending and result in a painful and limiting existence for many tens of millions of Americans and hundreds of millions of people around the world. Recursion Pharmaceuticals has developed a drug discovery platform that re-purposes known drugs for the treatment of such diseases. The platform consists of high content fluorescent image analysis using machine-learning algorithms to identify relevant and on-target changes induced in human cells in which diseases and treatments have been modeled. This system has been adapted to screen for drugs which may preferentially destroy senescent cells, as this may result in improved tissue function and decreases in pathology and mortality related to aging. In this SBIR fast-track proposal we will:  PHASE I Identify a morphological profile of senescence in a variety of human cell types. Progression to Phase II will depend on our ability to demonstrate the power of our morphological approach to identify senescent cells independent of any known senescent markers.  PHASE II Identify known drugs which preferentially destroy senescent cells, without affecting healthy cells, as identified by morphometric means.  Evaluate the efficacy of identified senolytic agents in a variety of tissue function and health-span models in mice. *Evaluate the effect of identified senolytic agents in a murine model of age-associated cardiovascular disease. Recursion Pharmaceuticals has the experience, tools, and drive to execute this Phase I/Phase II Fast-track SBIR proposal, and to accelerate commercial development of any compounds we identify as a result. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic diseases of aging affect a significant proportion of Americans. Cellular senescence, a useful biological program which prevents replication of cells exposed to various stresses that may be at risk of initiating tumors, has long-term deleterious inflammatory effects. We will combine biological, imaging, and computational approaches to identify complex morphological profiles associated with senescence, to identify senescence- killing effects of known drugs, and to evaluate any hits in relevant models of aging.",Novel Methodology for Identification of Senolytics that Reduce Age-related Disease and Dysfunction,9792234,R44AG053131,"['Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' Pathology ', ' Risk ', ' Stress ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Tumor Initiators ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' improved ', ' Image Analysis ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Functional disorder ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Exposure to ', ' Morphology ', ' Inflammatory ', ' tool ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' cell type ', ' System ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' drug discovery ', ' Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' SBIR ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' fluorescence imaging ', ' fluorescent imaging ', ' senescence ', ' senescent ', ' public health relevance ', ' healthspan ', ' health-span ', ' Drug Screening ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Replicative Senescence ', ' Cellular Senescence ', ' Cellular Aging ', ' Cell Senescence ', ' Cell Aging ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug treatment ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' ']",NIA,"RECURSION PHARMACEUTICALS, LLC",R44,2019,434004,UT-02,0.018088761642718852
"Early development of small molecule dendritic cell immunopotentiators for the treatment of solid tumors Summary The critical role of the innate immune system in priming CD8+ T cells to generate tumor specific responses underscores a potentially important clinical strategy for the development of next-generation immunotherapies. In this proposal, we pursue the hypothesis that small molecules identified in a high throughput screen for innate immune agonists can significantly improve the therapeutic efficacy of the oncolytic NDV (NewCastle Disease Virus) through activation of antigen presenting cells (APCs), and enhancement of anticancer immune responses. To address this, we propose specific aims that focus on hit validation through both ex vivo and in vivo characterization of compounds and assessing the in vivo efficacy in a B16-F10 mouse melanoma model. First, utilizing orthogonal assays, we will validate the immunopotentiation properties of compounds in ex vivo human primary monocyte derived dendritic cell (MDDC). Specifically, we propose to assess compound effects on MDDC activation and maturation through examination of transcriptional profiles, expression of DC activation markers, and cytokines being secreted upon compound treatment. Validated hits will then be clustered based on their activities, and the most potent compounds from each cluster will be carried forward to anti-tumor efficacy testing in a mouse melanoma model. Compounds will be added either alone or together with intratumoral injection of oncolytic NDV. Compound that synergize and enhance the anti-tumor activity of NDV, provide durable protection, and abscopal activity will be prioritized for subsequent early lead optimization.  Based on data generated from these hit validation approaches, we propose to delineate ex vivo immune signatures that can be used as surrogates for in vivo efficacy. The immune signatures elicited by selected hits within both MDDCs (ex vivo) and the tumor microenvironment (TME - in vivo) will be integrated to construct a computational model to assess correlative signatures that are able to link MDDC molecular and phenotypic responses to in vivo efficacy. Similar analysis will be conducted on immune activation readouts in the TME. This will be a reiterative process, with information obtained from the experimental studies will be utilized to refine predictions of ex vivo and in vivo biomarkers that correlate with efficacy. The information gained from this proposed study upon completion will significantly facilitate further hit-to-lead and lead optimization activities during subsequent phases of the drug development process. Narrative Newcastle Disease virus (NDV) is a promising viral agent for cancer therapy, due to its ability to induce Type-I IFNs, activation of antigen presenting cells (APCs) and lymphocyte infiltration into the tumor microenvironment, and induce systemic cytotoxic T cell immune responses. Using a high throughput screening approach, we have identified small molecule immunopotentiators of dendritic cell activation, and found that they harbor potent synergistic activities with oncolytic NDV in a mouse tumor model. The proposed study has a strong potential of generating T cell responses against tumor-specific antigens expressed by a patient’s individual cancer, potentially offering a novel immunotherapeutic

"Repurposing pyronaridine as a treatment for Chagas disease Summary Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are a diverse group of diseases with distinct characteristics that thrive mainly among the poorest populations of the world. There are 17 NTDs prioritized by the World Health Organization which are endemic in 149 countries and affect more than 1.4 billion people globally, which costs these developing economies billions of dollars annually. The neglected tropical diseases result from four different causative pathogens: protozoa, bacteria, helminth and virus. The majority of the diseases lack effective treatments. For example, 6 to 7 million people in Latin America are infected with the eukaryotic parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease. This disease is gaining recognition as an emerging infection in the United States where an estimated 300,000 people may be infected. Chagas disease has a serious economic impact on the United States and the world. The cost of treatment in the United States alone, where the disease is not indigenous, is estimated to be $900 million annually, which includes hospitalization and medical devices such as pacemakers. The global cost is estimated at $7 billion. Unfortunately, there are no FDA approved treatments for Chagas disease and the two available treatments used outside the U.S. have toxic side effects. New therapeutics for Chagas disease and the other NTDs are desperately needed. Using a machine learning model based on published data for compounds tested against T. cruzi we have identified the EU-approved antimalarial pyronaridine as particularly active in vitro and in vivo with statistically significant efficacy in a 4-day mouse model of infection with a T. cruzi strain expressing firefly luciferase. Pyronaridine demonstrated 85.2% parasite reduction after 4 days treatment, and is known to have a long half-life in humans (13.2 days), promising toxicity profile (less toxic than chloroquine in malaria treatment) and may suggest a drug repurposing opportunity for further study. We propose in this project to determine the minimum effective dose (treatment regimen) for pyronaridine in the acute model of Chagas disease. We will also determine efficacy in the chronic phase of Chagas disease (sterile cure). We will pursue combination therapy DMPK profiling as well as performing combination therapy in vivo efficacy in chronic model of Chagas disease. The results will enable us to assess whether this EU approved drug is worthy of a clinical trial for Chagas disease in the UH3 stage. If successful we will design a clinical study and recruit patients for a phase II trial. This grant represents a unique opportunity to partner the Center for Discovery and Innovation in Parasitic Diseases (www.cdipd.org) at UCSD and the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil with Collaborations Pharmaceuticals Inc. Narrative Approximately 6 to 7 million people in Latin America are infected with the eukaryotic parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of the deadly Chagas disease. This disease is gaining recognition as an emerging infection in the United States where an estimated 300,000 people may be infected and there is no FDA approved treatment. The antimalarial pyronaridine was recently identified by our groups using computational Bayesian repurposing methods and was confirmed as active when tested in vitro and in vivo in the acute mouse model of Chagas disease. We now propose in the UH2 stage to determine: the minimum effective dose in the acute model of Chagas disease and efficacy in the chronic phase while also assessing potential for combination therapy.

"Increasing NF1 Expression as a Treatment for NF1 Haploinsufficiency Project Abstract Haploinsufficiency plays a crucial role in Neurofibromatosis (NF1), an autosomal dominant genetic disorder impacting over 120,000 individuals in the United States. Current therapeutic approaches focus on specific components of NF1 signaling, for example inhibiting MEK signaling pathways in tumors, thus failing to address the broad range of signaling and symptoms associated with NF1. Given that NF1 is characterized by both autosomal dominance and haploinsufficiency (lack of normal protein), upregulating protein expression of the remaining wild-type NF1 allele has the ability to compensate for loss of function from the mutant allele, thus alleviating a broad range of NF1 symptoms and overall disease progression. Infixion proposes to build a luciferase reporting assay to evaluate NF1 expression against known drugs, including 50+ compounds, across six drug classes, already identified by Infixion to correlate with increased NF1 expression. By confirming that these candidate drugs activate NF1 transcription, increase NF1 protein expression, and normalize Ras pathway signaling in NF1 +/- Schwann cells, and by further screening libraries of known drugs for increased NF1 expression, we propose a novel path of NF1 drug discovery that will impact a broad range of NF1 patients and symptoms, in a preventative manner, and without regard to the wide spectrum of NF1 genetic mutations. Research Background. Increasing NF1 expression via transfection reverses abnormal Ras activation resulting from NF1 loss (Wallis, et al. 2018). Transcriptional activation in other genetic conditions such as Willams-Beuren Syndrome, and Supravalvular Aortic Stenosis compensates for haploinsufficiency (Giordano, et al. 2012). Lastly, overcoming haploinsufficiency in another autosomal dominant condition (Sim1 induced obesity; mouse model) was recently shown using a Crispr/dCas9 transcriptional activator (Ahituv, et al. 2019). Specific Aims. 1) Construct a luciferase reporter assay engineered into the endogenous NF1 gene of a well characterized, publically available, immortalized NF1 +/- Schwann cell line (Wallace et al. 2016; data published at Synapse.org). Validate assay using a viral transcription factor developed by Infixion using Crispr/dCas9 to upregulate NF1. 2) Deploy this NF1 luciferase reporter assay to screen 50+ known drugs shown by Infixion to correlate with increased NF1 expression across various cell/tissue types. Next, use this validated luciferase reporter to screen a 13,000+ compound repurposing library of known drugs available from Scripps Research Institute (known as ReFrame). 3) The top hits from Aim 2 screens will be evaluated, utilizing both immortalized and iPSC derived NF1+/- Schwann cells, for the following: a) ability to induce NF1 mRNA and protein expression, using qPCR and Westerns, b) the impact on Ras signaling (pERK, ELK-1, AKT, etc.) utilizing a targeted quantitative mass spec proteomics assay, c) their broader impact on gene expression in Schwann cells utilizing RNAseq, d) impact on cell proliferation, and e) their safety profile based on published data from previous trials. The goal is to prioritize not more than 3-5 candidates to take forward into a Phase 2 evaluation. Project Narrative Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder that impacts an estimated 1 in 3000 people worldwide, and one that is characterized by a complex set of symptoms shown to be dependent on haploinsufficiency (i.e., the lack of normal protein). By upregulating NF1 protein expression from the normal allele by two-fold, and thus restoring normal levels of functional NF1 protein in tissues important in NF1, we target a range of NF1 symptoms by eliminating the haploinsufficient environment. We propose to develop and utilize NF1-specific luciferase reporter and proteomic assays, along with standard small molecule evaluation tools, to characterize a small molecule library of repurposed drugs for their ability to upregulate NF1 transcription, and to further evaluate the resulting impact of “hits” on NF1 protein expression, cell proliferation, gene expression specificity, as well as downstream pathways (such as Ras, MEK, mTOR) known to be dysregulated by mutations in the NF1 gene.",Increasing NF1 Expression as a Treatment for NF1 Haploinsufficiency,10010298,R43NS117234,"['Alleles

"Next Generation Testing Strategies for Assessment of Genotoxicity Project Summary  It is well recognized that current batteries of genetic toxicology assays exhibit two critical deficiencies. First, the throughput capacity of in vitro mammalian cell genotoxicity tests is low, and does not meet current needs. Second, conventional assays provide simplistic binary calls, genotoxic or non-genotoxic. In this scheme there is little or no consideration for potency, and virtually no information is provided about molecular targets and mechanisms. These deficiencies in hazard characterization prevent genotoxicity data from optimally contributing to modern risk assessments, where this information is essential. We will address these major problems with current in vitro mammalian cell genetic toxicity assays by developing methods and associated commercial assay kits that dramatically enhance throughput capacity, and delineate genotoxicants' primary molecular targets, while simultaneously providing information about potency. Once biomarkers and a family of multiplexed assays have been developed for these purposes, an interlaboratory trial will be performed with prototype assay kits to assess the transferability of the methods. Project Narrative  DNA damage that cannot be faithfully repaired results in gene mutation and/or chromosomal aberrations, and these effects are known to contribute to cancer and other severe diseases. Thus, there is an important need for sensitive assays to evaluate chemicals for genotoxic and other deleterious effects. The work proposed herein will address issues that have plagued genotoxicity assessments for the last several decades: low throughput, lack of potency metrics, and little to no information about molecular targets. We will address these major problems with current genetic toxicity assays by developing new methods and associated commercial assay kits.",Next Generation Testing Strategies for Assessment of Genotoxicity,9838229,R44ES029014,"['Affect ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Epitopes ', ' Antigenic Determinants ', ' Binding Determinants ', ' Antioxidants ', ' anti-oxidant ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Biological Response Modifiers ', ' Biomodulators ', ' Immune Mediators ', ' Immune Mediators/Modulators ', ' Immune Regulators ', ' immunomodulatory biologics ', ' Bleomycin ', ' Bleo ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cell Cycle ', ' Cell Division Cycle ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chromosome abnormality ', ' Aberrant Chromosome ', ' Chromosomal Aberrations ', ' Chromosomal Abnormalities ', ' Chromosomal Alterations ', ' Chromosome Aberrations ', ' Chromosome Alterations ', ' Chromosome Anomalies ', ' Cytogenetic Aberrations ', ' Cytogenetic Abnormalities ', ' chromosomal defect ', ' chromosome defect ', ' Chromosomes ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' clastogen ', ' Caspase ', ' Caspase Gene ', ' Cell-Death Protease ', ' Cysteine Endopeptidases ', ' Cysteine Protease ', ' Cysteine Proteinases ', ' ICE-like protease ', ' cystein protease ', ' cystein proteinase ', ' cysteine endopeptidase ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA Damage ', ' DNA Injury ', ' DNA Repair ', ' DNA Damage Repair ', ' Unscheduled DNA Synthesis ', ' Etoposide ', ' EPEG ', ' Eposide ', ' Lastet ', ' Vepesid ', ' Exhibits ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Histone H3 ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' In Vitro ', ' Intercalating Agents ', ' DNA Intercalating Agent ', ' Intercalating Ligands ', ' Intercalative Compounds ', ' Intercalators ', ' Kinetics ', ' Laboratories ', ' Methods ', ' Microtubules ', ' Micro-tubule ', ' Modernization ', ' Mutagenicity Tests ', ' Genetic Toxicity Tests ', ' Genotoxicity Tests ', ' Mutagen Screening ', ' mutagen testing ', ' Reagent ', ' Reference Values ', ' Reference Ranges ', ' Stains ', ' Staining method ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' TP53 gene ', ' P53 ', ' TP53 ', ' TRP53 ', ' Tumor Protein p53 Gene ', ' p53 Genes ', ' NF-kappa B ', ' Immunoglobulin Enhancer-Binding Protein ', ' NF-kB ', ' NF-kappaB ', ' NFKB ', ' Nuclear Factor kappa B ', ' Nuclear Transcription Factor NF-kB ', ' Transcription Factor NF-kB ', ' kappa B Enhancer Binding Protein ', ' nuclear factor kappa beta ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Schedule ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' Procedures ', ' repair ', ' repaired ', ' Phase ', ' Series ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Chemicals ', ' Training ', ' aurora kinase ', ' Genetic ', ' cleaved ', ' Cleaved cell ', ' Companions ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Pulse ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Nuclear ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Gene Alteration ', ' Gene Mutation ', ' genotoxicity ', ' hazard ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Appearance ', ' Colcemide ', ' Colcemid ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Aneugenic Agents ', ' Aneuploidy-Inducing Agents ', ' Aneugens ', ' Genetic Toxicology ', ' Toxicology Genetics ', ' Toxicogenetics ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' DDIT1 ', ' DNA Damage-Inducible Gene GADD45 ', ' DNA Damage-Inducible Transcript 1 ', ' GADD45 ', ' GADD45A ', ' Growth Arrest-and DNA Damage-Inducible Gene GADD45, Alpha ', ' GADD45A gene ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' DNA Double Strand Break ', ' Data ', ' Harvest ', ' Mammalian Cell ', ' Molecular Target ', ' Scheme ', ' Validation ', ' Modification ', ' DNA-PKcs ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' virtual ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' next generation ', ' prototype ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' targeted agent ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' γH2AX ', ' Gamma-H2AX ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' therapy optimization ', ' treatment optimization ', ' random forest ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' Computer Models ', ' ']",NIEHS,"LITRON LABORATORIES, LTD.",R44,2020,474671,NY-25,0.060513459860964736
"Developing a systems biology platform for predicting, preventing, and treating drug side effects Project Summary Adverse drug reactions (ADRs), more commonly known as drug side effects, are estimated to cause over 200,000 deaths in the US annually, are responsible for 6.5% of all hospital admissions, and 28% of clinical trial failures. ADRs are estimated to increase healthcare costs by $136 billion per year in the USA alone. Current safety and modeling efforts that are commonly used in the pharma industry (such as PK/PD) do not elucidate the complex pathophysiology underlying ADRs. These safety and modeling approaches are used predominantly to quantitatively understand exposure-response relationships for clinical dosing, but with a few exceptions do not focus on the cellular pharmacodynamic mechanisms of why drugs cause ADRs. Elucidating the downstream and systemic effects of pharmaceuticals is critical to understanding ADR pathogenesis and developing safer therapies. Drugs can affect multiple proteins and each protein that they modulate may play roles in multiple cellular processes. Systems biology and bioinformatics approaches coupled with machine learning are crucial for understanding the multi-factorial pathophysiology of ADRs. In Phase I of this program, we developed an in vitro transcriptomics based computational platform that 1) predicts drug-side effect liability equivalent to current gold-standard approaches that require considerably more information about the compound and its effects, 2) defines genes that are relevant to ADR pathophysiology, and 3) identifies therapeutically beneficial compounds for the ADR. Based on the computational platform, we discovered a repurposing opportunity for an off-patent, non-FDA approved drug in Parkinson’s Disease that we are currently pursuing towards clinical development. This drug significantly improves levodopa’s efficacy, without exacerbating the drug’s major side effect which often precludes levodopa’s use. In Phase II of this proposal, we will continue to develop and expand the ADR computational platform. Further, we will hone our focus on two key clinically and commercially relevant ADRs: antipsychotic induced tardive dyskinesia and radio-/chemo- therapy induced mucosal inflammation. We will generate rich datasets for these ADRs to both validate our in vitro platform with in vivo data and to understand the pathophysiology of these ADRs at an unprecedented level. Further, we will use the datasets to generate computational predictions for discovering/repurposing drugs to improve safety in psychiatric and cancer treatments. The best predictions will be subsequently tested in vitro and developed through partnerships and external funding mechanisms. Project Narrative Adverse drug reactions, more commonly known as drug side effects, cause over 200,000 deaths in the US annually, are responsible for 6.5% of all hospital admissions, and 28% of clinical trial failures.

"Development of FAST-DOSE assay system for the rapid assessment of acute radiation exposure, individual radiosensitivity and injury in victims for a large-scale radiological incident Summary Following a large scale radiological or nuclear event, hundreds of thousands of people may be exposed to ionizing radiation/s and require subsequent dose-dependent medical management. It will be crucial to collect and analyze human biofluids (such as blood, urine, saliva) as soon as possible within the first week for accurate dose prediction and early triage decision. There is a need for FDA-approved in vitro diagnostic high-throughput biodosimetry devices with the ability to determine past radiation exposure with precision and accuracy. At the Center for High Throughput Radiation Biodosimetry, the Columbia University Center for Medical Countermeasures against Radiation (CMCR), we have developed FAST-DOSE (Fluorescent Automated Screening Tool for Dosimetry) assay system, to measure radiation-responsive proteins in human peripheral blood samples for retrospective estimation of radiation dose. The protein panel also includes biomarkers for blood leukocyte subtypes to reflect hematological sensitivity and injury. The FAST- DOSE assay system is intended as an in vitro diagnostic device (IVD) as defined by 21 CFR 809.3. The platform uses a commercial imaging flow cytometry system (ImageStream®X) and associated Image Data Exploration and Analysis Software (IDEAS®) to rapidly quantify changes in biomarker expression levels within specific cellular structures using fluorescent imagery and algorithms for estimation of absorbed dose. The studies planned here are designed to develop and optimize our FAST-DOSE assay system to accurately estimate absorbed dose and assess hematopoietic injury in human lymphocytes after ionizing irradiation. The first objective is to build on our current biomarker validation data for early engagement with the FDA via the pre-submission process. We have used the human ex vivo model and humanized mouse (Hu-NSG) and non- human primate (NHP) models to validate biomarker expression and radiosensitivity in blood leukocytes after acute ionizing radiation exposure. The Specific Aims proposed here are designed to: optimize the assay protocol and identify biomarker dose/time kinetics for accurate dose predictions in vitro and test 1) inter-donor variation, 2) intra-donor variation and 3) inter-laboratory variability (Aim 1); test the effect of specific confounders: age and sex, inheritance with germline BRCA1/2 pathogenic variant, and inflammation and trauma on the biomarker response, before and after irradiation (Aim 2); measure biomarker levels and time kinetics in vivo and correlate with hematopoietic injury, based on peripheral blood leukocyte counts, and stem and progenitor cell levels in the bone marrow of Hu-NSG mice (Aim 3) and, develop mathematical models (using machine learning and regression techniques) to select the best FAST-DOSE biomarkers and their combinations for generating dose predictions based on the ex vivo and in vivo dose response of these biomarkers (Aim 4). Our vision for future development is to develop a more simplified, faster rapid FAST-DOSE assay system whereby the biomarkers could be developed and transitioned for use in a point-of-care (POC) device. NARRATIVE We have developed a high-throughput biodosimetry device, the FAST-DOSE (Fluorescent Automated Screening Tool for Dosimetry) assay system to measure radiation-responsive proteins in human blood leukocytes for retrospective estimation of radiation dose. Studies are designed to validate and test the performance of the blood protein biomarker panel to accurately predict absorbed dose after ionizing radiation exposure. We will correlate biomarker expression levels and time kinetics with hematopoietic injury, based on peripheral blood leukocyte counts and bone marrow toxicity in humanized mice.","Development of

"Role of Epigenetically Active  Environmental Compounds in Neurodevelopmental Disorders PROJECT SUMMARY Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), are increasingly recognized as originating from dysregulation of early brain development, which represents a window of vulnerability to environmental compounds. Environmental compounds may alter neurodevelopment via epigenetic mechanisms, which may not induce massive cell death, but change the brain function through their epigenetic effect on stem cell fate and lineage development. However, tools to systematically examine the epigenetic impact of environment on neurodevelopment are lacking. Here we employ Microscopic Imaging of Epigenetic Landscape (MIEL) to screen ToxCast Phase III chemical library (4700 compounds) and to characterize hits that alter epigenetic landscape of human neural precursors without inducing cytotoxicity. Recognizing environmental insults and understanding their mechanism of action will enable the development of regulations and guidelines aimed at avoiding such insults and the development of antidotes and protective agents when exposure is unavoidable.

"Integrative chemical-biological profiling to determine primary drivers of wildfire smoke-induced toxicity PROJECT SUMMARY  Wildfire occurrence, duration, and intensity have heightened in recent decades and continue to impact the health of millions of individuals worldwide. Smoke that is emitted from wildfires consists of a complex mixture of particulate matter and toxic gases. The chemical composition of wildfire smoke is dependent upon the type of biomass burn conditions and fuel type, which are heavily influenced by geographical region. The chemical mixtures within wildfire smoke that humans are exposed to can consequently cause variable health outcomes through potentially different biological mechanisms. Human exposure to wildfire smoke represents a growing concern in public health, and adequately characterizing health risks associated with biomass smoke across varying burn conditions and geographic areas is not possible with the data currently available.  The variabilities in toxicological responses across wildfire smoke exposure conditions have yet to be fully established and evaluated in the context of chemical composition. The growing threat of wildfires necessitates the elucidation of individual and/or co-occurring components of wildfire smoke that act as the primary drivers of toxicity. To address this important research issue, we expand upon a foundational study that has previously characterized the chemical constituents in various biomass burn scenarios and evaluated, in part, toxicological responses to these exposures in the mouse lung. Here, we leverage this extensive database and banked samples to: 1. characterize in vivo transcriptomic responses and pathway alterations associated with biomass smoke in the mouse lung; 2. integrate chemical-toxicity profiles using computational approaches to prioritize chemicals that are likely driving toxicity responses; and 3. further evaluate chemical drivers of biomass smoke toxicity responses using in vitro approaches.  This research will be carried out through a collaboration with laboratories at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, allowing for a unique combination of expertise for studying the primary drivers of wildfire smoke-induced toxicity. This expertise includes skills in computational toxicology, exposure science, and molecular biology, coupled with experience studying adverse health effects and immune responses induced by exposure to air pollutants. PROJECT NARRATIVE Exposure to wildfire smoke continues to be a growing threat to public health, yet the primary drivers of toxicity and disease are not completely understood. This proposal represents an innovative approach to increase understanding on the health effects of wildfires by leveraging a robust dataset of chemical-biological profiles from mice exposed to biomass smoke condensate samples derived from variable conditions. New data will also be generated alongside additional in vitro testing to more comprehensively examine mechanisms of toxicity and identify the primary drivers of wildfire smoke-induced toxicity, resulting in improved abilities to predict region- specific health risks attributable to wildfires.",Integrative chemical-biological profiling to determine primary drivers of wildfire smoke-induced toxicity,9956440,R21ES031740,"['Affect ', ' Air ', ' Air Pollutants ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Biomass ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Analytical Chemistry ', ' Analytic Chemistry ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA Damage ', ' DNA Injury ', ' Female ', ' Foundations ', ' Gases ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographical Location ', ' geographic site ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' In Vitro ', ' Inflammation ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lung ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung diseases ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' disease of the lung ', ' disorder of the lung ', ' lung disorder ', ' male ', ' Methods ', ' Molecular Biology ', ' DNA Molecular Biology ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' North Carolina ', ' Phenotype ', ' Proteins ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Smoke ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Toxicology ', ' United States Environmental Protection Agency ', ' Environmental Protection Agency ', ' Universities ', ' Measures ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Chemicals ', ' Individual ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' smoke inhalation ', ' Lung damage ', ' lung injury ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Collaborations ', ' Critical Paths ', ' Critical Pathways ', ' Immunological response ', ' host response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' Immune response ', ' Exposure to ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' respiratory ', ' Inhalation Exposure ', ' experience ', ' genotoxicity ', ' toxicant ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Lung Parenchyma ', ' Lung Tissue ', ' Structure of parenchyma of lung ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Toxicogenomics ', ' Complex Mixtures ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' in vivo ', ' Chemically Induced Toxicity ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Particulate Matter ', ' data integration ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Coupled ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' transcriptomics ', ' Wildfire ', ' human exposure ', ' exposed human population ', ' public health relevance ', ' in vitro testing ', ' data reduction ', ' biomass smoke ', ' biomass fuel ', ' protein markers ', ' protein biomarkers ', ' computational toxicology ', ' Inhaling ', ' Inhalation ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databanks ', ' data depository ', ' data repository ', ' data warehouse ', ' asthma attack ', ' exacerbation in asthma ', ' exacerbation prone asthma ', ' exacerbation prone asthmatic ', ' asthma exacerbation ', ' ']",NIEHS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R21,2020,227277,NC-04,0.04359078535390994
"Phenotypic Screening for Longevity Interventions Using Single-cell Epigenetic Signatures PROJECT SUMMARY Recent advances in understanding the biology of aging have raised the prospect of drug interventions to promote healthy aging in humans. However, such interventions should have essentially no toxicity or side effects. In practice, the throughput of drug testing (currently conducted in animals) is one of the major limitations for identifying interventions to promote healthy aging. Hence, a challenge is to identify candidate drugs able to induce rejuvenation and/or healthy aging, with minimal side effects in a high throughput fashion. Here we propose to take advantage of a novel high content screening approach based on imaging of epigenetic landscape in single cells. To meet the challenge, we propose to take advantage of a novel technique we have developed that is rooted in the analysis of epigenome topography at the single cell level, automated microscopy, and machine learning. “Microscopic Imaging of Epigenetic Landscapes” (MIEL) captures patterns of nuclear staining of epigenetic marks (e.g. acetylated and methylated histones) and employs machine learning to accurately distinguish between such patterns. Pertinent to this application, we have tested whether MIEL approach is suitable for building a phenotypic cell-based assay for inducers of longevity at the cellular level. Our preliminary results validated MIEL assay for a high content screening application to identify novel candidate pro-longevity compounds. In sum, we have developed and validated a high content cell-based screening assay capable of identifying pro-longevity/healthy aging compounds based on their effect on epigenetic signature. Our specific Aims are as follows: Specific Aim 1. Screen for novel inducers of cellular rejuvenation. Specific Aim 2. Validation of novel inducers of cellular rejuvenation. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent advances in understanding the biology of aging have raised the prospect of drug interventions to promote healthy aging in humans.

"Novel Methodology for Identification of Senolytics that Reduce Age-related Disease and Dysfunction DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic diseases of aging account for a significant proportion of healthcare spending and result in a painful and limiting existence for many tens of millions of Americans and hundreds of millions of people around the world. Recursion Pharmaceuticals has developed a drug discovery platform that re-purposes known drugs for the treatment of such diseases. The platform consists of high content fluorescent image analysis using machine-learning algorithms to identify relevant and on-target changes induced in human cells in which diseases and treatments have been modeled. This system has been adapted to screen for drugs which may preferentially destroy senescent cells, as this may result in improved tissue function and decreases in pathology and mortality related to aging. In this SBIR fast-track proposal we will:  PHASE I Identify a morphological profile of senescence in a variety of human cell types. Progression to Phase II will depend on our ability to demonstrate the power of our morphological approach to identify senescent cells independent of any known senescent markers.  PHASE II Identify known drugs which preferentially destroy senescent cells, without affecting healthy cells, as identified by morphometric means.  Evaluate the efficacy of identified senolytic agents in a variety of tissue function and health-span models in mice. *Evaluate the effect of identified senolytic agents in a murine model of age-associated cardiovascular disease. Recursion Pharmaceuticals has the experience, tools, and drive to execute this Phase I/Phase II Fast-track SBIR proposal, and to accelerate commercial development of any compounds we identify as a result. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic diseases of aging affect a significant proportion of Americans. Cellular senescence, a useful biological program which prevents replication of cells exposed to various stresses that may be at risk of initiating tumors, has long-term deleterious inflammatory effects. We will combine biological, imaging, and computational approaches to identify complex morphological profiles associated with senescence, to identify senescence- killing effects of known drugs, and to evaluate any hits in relevant models of aging.",Novel Methodology for Identification of Senolytics that Reduce Age-related Disease and Dysfunction,9948564,R44AG053131,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' beta-Galactosidase ', ' beta-D-Galactosidase ', ' beta-D-Galactoside galactohydrolase ', ' lac Z Protein ', ' β-D-Galactosidase ', ' β-D-Galactoside galactohydrolase ', ' β-Galactosidase ', ' Biology ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Cell Aging ', ' Cell Senescence ', ' Cellular Aging ', ' Cellular Senescence ', ' Replicative Senescence ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' NIDDM ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2 DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2DM ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' type 2 DM ', ' type II DM ', ' type two diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA Damage ', ' DNA Injury ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Economics ', ' Future ', ' Genetic Engineering ', ' Genetic Engineering Biotechnology ', ' Genetic Engineering Molecular Biology ', ' Recombinant DNA Technology ', ' genetically engineered ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hydrogen Peroxide ', ' H2O2 ', ' Hydroperoxide ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease ', ' COPD ', ' Chronic Obstruction Pulmonary Disease ', ' Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease ', ' Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ', ' Mammals ', ' Mammalia ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity -

"MegaTox for analyzing and visualizing data across different screening systems Project Summary Computational toxicology aims to use rules, models and algorithms based on prior data for specific endpoints, to enable the prediction of whether a new molecule will possess similar liabilities or not. Our recent efforts have used sources like PubChem and ChEMBL to build predictive models for different toxicity-related and drug discovery endpoints. Our Phase I SBIR proposal called MegaTox will provide toxicity machine learning models developed with different algorithms for 40-50 in vitro and in vivo toxicity datasets. We propose using this technology to generate machine learning models for predicting potential compounds against either TGF- a target for countering chlorine induced lung inflammation as well as the adenosine A1 receptor to identify agonists as potential anticonvulsants. In addition, we can also compile molecules that can reactivate acetylcholinesterase which would enable the potential to discover medical countermeasures to address nerve agent and pesticide poisoning. We will access multiple machine learning approaches and validate these Bayesian or other machine learning models (including Linear Logistic Regression, AdaBoost Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and deep neural networks (DNN) of varying depth) with our own in-house technology for these selected targets. We will aim for ROC values greater than 0.75 and MCC and F1 scores that are acceptable (>0.3). These models will be used to virtually screen FDA approved drugs, clinical candidates, commercially available drugs or other molecules. We will select up to 50 molecules to be tested using in vitro assays alongside controls for each target. These combined efforts should in the first instance provide commercially viable treatments which will be used to experimentally validate our computational models that can be shared with the medical countermeasures scientific community. In summary, we are proposing to build and validate models for targets based on public databases, select compounds for testing, create proprietary data and use this as a starting point for further optimization of compounds if needed. Our goal is to identify at least one promising compound for each target that we then pursue and protect our IP. We will pursue additional grant funding to take these medical countermeasures through additional in vitro and in vivo preclinical studies. Ultimately, we will license our products to larger companies for development prior to clinical trials. Project Narrative There is an urgent need to develop medical countermeasures (MCM) to address pulmonary agents, nerve agents and organophosphorus pesticides. Our approach leverages public and private data to build machine learning models for different targets involved in the physiological effects of the aforementioned agents. We then use these computational models to select new molecules to test in vitro. Our approach builds on our MegaTox approach focused on modeling toxicology targets to specifically focus on identifying compounds for TGF-β and Adenosine A1 as well as potential AChE reactivators. This computational approach will be validated using in vitro testing and offers several advantages to identify potential novel or repurposed molecules as MCM including speed and cost-effectiveness.",MegaTox for analyzing and visualizing data across different screening systems,10094026,R43ES031038,"['Acetylcholinesterase ', ' Acetylcholine Hydrolase ', ' acetylcholine acetylhydrolase ', ' choline esterase I ', ' Adenosine ', ' Adenosine A1 Receptor ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anticonvulsants ', ' Anticonvulsant Agent ', ' Anticonvulsant Drugs ', ' Anticonvulsive Agents ', ' Anticonvulsive Drugs ', ' Chlorine ', ' Cl element ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Decision Trees ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' In Vitro ', ' Pesticides ', ' Privatization ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Toxicology ', ' Transforming Growth Factor alpha ', ' Epidermal Growth Factor-Related Transforming Growth Factor ', ' TGF A ', ' TGF-alpha ', ' TGF-α ', ' TGFalpha ', ' TGFα ', ' Transforming Growth Factor beta ', ' Bone-Derived Transforming Growth Factor ', ' Milk Growth Factor ', ' Platelet Transforming Growth Factor ', ' TGF B ', ' TGF-beta ', ' TGF-β ', ' TGFbeta ', ' TGFβ ', ' Transforming Growth Factor-Beta Family Gene ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' Phase ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Ache ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Licensing ', ' Funding ', ' Agonist ', ' pesticide toxicity ', ' pesticide poisoning ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Speed ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' drug discovery ', ' nerve agent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' in vitro Assay ', ' in vivo ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pre-clinical study ', ' preclinical study ', ' PubChem ', ' virtual ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Lung Inflammation ', ' choking agent ', ' pulmonary agents ', ' FDA approved ', ' in vitro testing ', ' screening ', ' computational toxicology ', ' clinical candidate ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep neural network ', ' random forest ', ' medical countermeasure ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' Computer Models ', ' support vector machine ', ' ']",NIEHS,"COLLABORATIONS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.",R43,2020,124915,NC-02,0.08563915187194966

"A Multiwell Plate Format Microfluidic Immobilization Chip for High-Content Imaging of Whole Animals for in vivoNeurotoxicology Testing Project Summary: Neurotoxicological evaluation of new compounds intended for human use or of potential human exposure is mandated by international regulatory bodies and largely relies on lethality testing in higher-order vertebrate animals. High screening costs, long experimental times, and legislative requirements to reduce dependence on animal testing have led many industries to search for alternative technologies. In vitro toxicology testing uses isolated cells or monotypic cell culture and can only provide limited insight since these models lack biologically relevant intact multi-typic cellular network structures. While both technologies have been augmented by in silico technologies, there is still a non-trivial gap between what can be learned and translated from simple, fast, inexpensive in vitro methods versus longer, complex, and costly in vivo studies in higher order animals. Newormics’ approach to filling this gap is to enable in vivo neurotoxicological assessment in Caenorhabditis elegans, an accepted alternative invertebrate model organism, by developing neuron-specific toxicity assays, delivered via a proprietary high-density, large-scale microfluidic immobilization device for high-content, high throughput analysis. Building on advances made during Phase I and important market learnings from participation in the NIH I-Corps program, Phase II proposes several new elements of innovation to achieve our goals in 3 specific aims. In Aim 1, we will convert our first-generation microfluidic device to a high-density (384- well) vivoChip with improved microfabrication technologies, incorporate on-chip culture for transfer-less exposure and testing, and integrate automation for chip loading, imaging, and analysis. These measures will significantly increase test scale (from 80 compounds per chip to 280) and lower the consumable and labor costs per test. In Aim 2, building on our dopaminergic neurotox assay from Phase I, we will develop four neurotox assays with brightly fluorescently labeled dopaminergic, serotonergic, GABAergic, and cholinergic neurons providing the unprecedented ability to assess subtle phenotypic effects of chemicals on individual intact, functional neurons. To achieve real-time image processing, multi-parameter phenotyping, and managing the terabytes of image data generated per test, we will build a computational platform empowered by a graphic user interface. This platform will be used for image compilation, user-annotated phenotype definition and scoring, and automated report generation with appropriate statistical analysis. In Aim 3, with our industry partners, we will validate our platform and assays using reference chemicals. As more chemicals are tested, we will build a database which can be further mined. The outcome of this work will enable many industries to reduce lethal animal testing and get safer industrial and personal consumer products to market faster for economic benefit, reaching regulatory compliance for reduced animal use, and improved healthcare for neurological diseases.

"Developing an in vitro to in vivo pipeline of mammary gland exposure-response relationships to per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) Project Abstract  Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a family of over 5000 man-made chemicals that are ubiquitous in the environment, due to their chemical stability and bioaccumulative properties. Many of these “forever chemicals” have been linked with health concerns, including strong evidence of developmental health and harm to hormone-sensitive tissues. Manufacturers continue to substitute new PFAS for which exposure- based health risks are unknown. There is an urgent public health need to determine the effects of PFAS in use on both mammary gland development and increased breast cancer incidence. Current exposure studies use rodent models that require cumbersome end-point analyses as well as large monetary and time investments.  Our proposal is aimed at developing an in vitro to in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE) pipeline of mammary gland development and maintenance to identify and prioritize potentially toxic PFAS, to ultimately mitigate number of animals needed for environmental exposure studies. Our approach is to develop in vitro models of the mammary gland of increasing complexity but decreasing throughput, identifying links between high-throughput and high- complexity model endpoint readouts to best prioritize large chemical libraries. A key technology to establish links across multiple in vitro culture platforms is optical coherence tomography-based structural-functional imaging (OCT-SFI), developed by MPI Oldenburg, which non-invasively visualizes label-free cells, their intracellular motility, and morphology of formed spheroids, within optically turbid tissue models.  Our first specific aim advances a high-throughput paper-based culture system, developed by MPI Lockett, to study mammary epithelial cell invasion in physiologically relevant tissue microenvironments. The platform will evaluate 96 different exposure conditions in parallel. Our second specific aim employs 3D co-culture models that include fibroblasts to model stromal signaling known to affect mammary gland development. OCT-SFI will provide cellular motility and morphology of the organotypic spheroids that form in these cultures. Finally, our third aim will screen a library of 40 PFAS, with a particular focus on the perfluoroethercarboxylic acids (PFECAs) currently used in industrial coatings. In addition, 12 PFAS will be screened for which there is existing in vivo rodent model data available, and comparisons between in vitro assay outputs and in vivo gland remodeling will be used to refine the assay models and establish initial thresholds for screening.  The models developed as part of this proposal will thus be predictive of biology, enabling the high-throughput capability needed for future screening of all PFAS as well as other emerging endocrine disruptors. The project’s risk is balanced by the known imaging capabilities of OCT-SFI to probe responses in 3D spheroid and paper- based co-cultures. The high-throughput nature of this IVIVE pipeline makes it ideal for screening libraries of potential toxicants, providing information-rich datasets of spatially and temporally resolved morphological and molecular changes across the tissue-like structures. Project Narrative This proposal aims to develop a pipeline to screen and prioritize libraries of potentially toxic man-made chemicals found in the environment for further analyses, with particular emphasis on per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) of which there are over 5000 currently known. Current environmental exposure testing methods evaluate mammary gland development in live mice because the mammary gland is highly susceptible to chemical exposure; yet, such methods are slow and expensive. Our proposal uses mammary cell culture models in increasingly complex, tissue-like environments, in combination with high-speed 3D optical imaging techniques, and ultimately compare the platform with a few candidate PFAS against existing data in live mice, setting the stage for future high-throughput screening of potential environmental toxicants.",Developing an in vitro to in vivo pipeline of

"Early development of small molecule dendritic cell immunopotentiators for the treatment of solid tumors Summary The critical role of the innate immune system in priming CD8+ T cells to generate tumor specific responses underscores a potentially important clinical strategy for the development of next-generation immunotherapies. In this proposal, we pursue the hypothesis that small molecules identified in a high throughput screen for innate immune agonists can significantly improve the therapeutic efficacy of the oncolytic NDV (NewCastle Disease Virus) through activation of antigen presenting cells (APCs), and enhancement of anticancer immune responses. To address this, we propose specific aims that focus on hit validation through both ex vivo and in vivo characterization of compounds and assessing the in vivo efficacy in a B16-F10 mouse melanoma model. First, utilizing orthogonal assays, we will validate the immunopotentiation properties of compounds in ex vivo human primary monocyte derived dendritic cell (MDDC). Specifically, we propose to assess compound effects on MDDC activation and maturation through examination of transcriptional profiles, expression of DC activation markers, and cytokines being secreted upon compound treatment. Validated hits will then be clustered based on their activities, and the most potent compounds from each cluster will be carried forward to anti-tumor efficacy testing in a mouse melanoma model. Compounds will be added either alone or together with intratumoral injection of oncolytic NDV. Compound that synergize and enhance the anti-tumor activity of NDV, provide durable protection, and abscopal activity will be prioritized for subsequent early lead optimization.  Based on data generated from these hit validation approaches, we propose to delineate ex vivo immune signatures that can be used as surrogates for in vivo efficacy. The immune signatures elicited by selected hits within both MDDCs (ex vivo) and the tumor microenvironment (TME - in vivo) will be integrated to construct a computational model to assess correlative signatures that are able to link MDDC molecular and phenotypic responses to in vivo efficacy. Similar analysis will be conducted on immune activation readouts in the TME. This will be a reiterative process, with information obtained from the experimental studies will be utilized to refine predictions of ex vivo and in vivo biomarkers that correlate with efficacy. The information gained from this proposed study upon completion will significantly facilitate further hit-to-lead and lead optimization activities during subsequent phases of the drug development process. Narrative Newcastle Disease virus (NDV) is a promising viral agent for cancer therapy, due to its ability to induce Type-I IFNs, activation of antigen presenting cells (APCs) and lymphocyte infiltration into the tumor microenvironment, and induce systemic cytotoxic T cell immune responses. Using a high throughput screening approach, we have identified small molecule immunopotentiators of dendritic cell activation, and found that they harbor potent synergistic activities with oncolytic NDV in a mouse tumor model. The proposed study has a strong potential of generating T cell responses against tumor-specific antigens expressed by a patient’s individual cancer, potentially offering a novel immunotherapeutic

"Maximizing the predictive power of high-throughput, microscopy-based phenotypic screens PROJECT SUMMARY We currently have an unprecedented ability to profile the genetic- and pathway-level changes that occur in cancer. Yet, clinicians lack the diverse arsenal of drugs needed to treat subpopulations of patients more effectively, reduce side effects and offer second-line treatment when drug resistance emerges. There is a pressing need to dramatically increase the repertoire of drugs available to fight cancer. Advances in automated microscopy and computer vision, allow the widespread use of phenotypic profiling in early drug discovery. In this grant, we address two challenges. First, the power of phenotypic profiling has led to a growing number of large, disparate image datasets. In aim 1, we will develop machine-learning approaches that combine disparate datasets to obtain accurate predictions of uncharacterized compound function. Second, phenotypic screens can identify candidate compounds across multiple, diverse pathways, but often only use a single cancer cell line. In aim 2, we will develop strategies to identify minimal collections of cell lines that maximize detection of small molecule activities. Successful execution will: increase the power of phenotypic profiling by harnessing existing phenotypic screening datasets and providing a rational approach for selecting cell lines that maximize the chance of discovering hits in desired pathways. In this proposal, we will develop computational and experimental methods to maximize the power of high-throughput, microscopy-based phenotypic screens. Our studies will increase the power of phenotypic profiling by harnessing screens performed across the world, providing a rational approach for maximizing the chance of discovering hits for diverse pathways in future screens, and identifying novel compounds that expand our ability to perturb cancer-relevant pathways.

"Development of a Biocatalytic Platform for Convergent Synthesis of Chiral Amines Project Abstract  The protection of human health depends on the continued discovery of biologically active compounds and their development into useful pharmaceuticals. Historically, synthetic chemistry has enabled medicinal chemists to create and optimize novel lead compounds and has empowered process chemists to produce compounds at the scale necessary for the treatment of a population. The processes of drug discovery and drug production are undergoing a dramatic change with the development of efficient enzyme catalysts as practical tools for synthesis. Medicinal chemists are now harnessing the promiscuous activities of enzymes to access in a single step medicinally relevant compounds that otherwise require multiple-step chemical syntheses. Further, process chemists are starting to leverage the unrivalled efficiency and inherent sustain- ability of enzymes to replace the expensive catalysts and the toxic reagents and solvents that characterize many current production routes. As a result, enzymes are rapidly becoming important tools for pharmaceu- tical synthesis.  These transformative developments are unfortunately limited by the relative dearth of useful synthetic reactions in the ‘biocatalytic toolbox’. Our group has made fundamental advances to expanding this toolbox by using directed evolution to obtain new, useful biocatalysts starting from enzymes whose activities may have been low or even undetectable for the desired substrate or reaction.  This proposal seeks to expand and generalize a powerful biocatalytic platform for the synthesis of chiral amines. Such compounds are prevalent as building blocks for pharmaceuticals that encompass all realms of human health such as antibacterial, antifungal, and anticancer drugs. The ability to improve upon these compounds is dependent on access to suitable building blocks. We have identified the enzyme TrpB as a unique biocatalyst for the synthesis of chiral amines. This enzyme mediates a bond-forming reaction be- tween two substrates, one nucleophilic and one electrophilic. Previous work has almost exclusively focused on the activity of this enzyme with diverse nucleophilic substrates, for which TrpB has modest promiscuity. The research proposed here, by contrast, aims to expand the electrophilic substrate scope of the enzyme to make highly functionalized α-amino acids, as well as other classes of chiral amine such as amino alcohols and β-amino acids. The result of this research will be a new suite of biocatalysts that can be used to syn- thesize a wide range of chiral amine building blocks for the novel medicinal compounds essential for ad- vancing the diagnosis and treatment of human diseases. Project Narrative  The naturally occurring enzyme TrpB will be engineered to synthesize amino acids and chiral amines, which are ubiquitous precursors for bioactive compounds, both natural and synthetic. The results of this pro- ject will allow chemists and biologists direct access to these useful medicinal building blocks using a simple, efficient, and sustainable biocatalytic platform.",Development of a Biocatalytic Platform for Convergent Synthesis of Chiral Amines,9908105,R01GM125887,"['Acrylates ', ' Aldehyde-Lyases ', ' Aldolases ', ' Amines ', ' amine ', ' Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' Branched-Chain Amino Acids ', ' branched amino acids ', ' branched chain aminoacid ', ' Amino Alcohols ', ' aminoalcohol ', ' Transaminases ', ' Aminotransferases ', ' Antifungal Agents ', ' Antifungal Drug ', ' Therapeutic Fungicides ', ' anti-fungal ', ' anti-fungal agents ', ' anti-fungal drug ', ' antifungals ', ' Antineoplastic Agents ', ' Anti-Cancer Agents ', ' Antineoplastic Drugs ', ' Antineoplastics ', ' Cancer Drug ', ' Neoplastic Disease Chemotherapeutic Agents ', ' Tumor-Specific Treatment Agents ', ' anti-cancer drug ', ' anticancer agent ', ' anticancer drug ', ' Carbon ', ' chemical synthesis ', ' Dehydration ', ' body water dehydration ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Enzymes ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Health ', ' Homoserine ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Indoles ', ' Industry ', ' Production ', ' Propanolamines ', ' Aminopropanols ', ' Protein Engineering ', ' genetic protein engineering ', ' protein design ', ' Pyridoxal Phosphate ', ' Pyridoxal 5-Phosphate ', ' Reagent ', ' Research ', ' Solvents ', ' Threonine ', ' L-Threonine ', ' Tryptophan Synthase ', ' Tryptophan Synthetase ', ' tryptophan desmolase ', ' Tweens ', ' Work ', ' Mediating ', ' Ser-L ', ' serine-containing lipid ', ' serine containing aminolipid ', ' catalyst ', ' base ', ' carboxylate ', ' cofactor ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Active Sites ', ' analog ', ' enzyme activity ', ' Antibacterial Agents ', ' anti-bacterial ', ' antibacterial ', ' Anti-Bacterial Agents ', ' directed evolution ', ' Directed Molecular Evolution ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Reaction ', ' Route ', ' interest ', ' empowered ', ' success ', ' thermolability ', ' thermostability ', ' condensation ', ' Physical condensation ', ' 2-amino-1,3-propanediol ', ' serinol ', ' novel ', ' Property ', ' drug discovery ', ' drug production ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' Address ', ' Synthetic Chemistry ', ' Synthesis Chemistry ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' human disease ', ' novel lead compound ', ' ']",NIGMS,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2020,291940,CA-27,0.10335224810551871
"Compound repositioning for Alzheimer's Disease using knowledge graphs, insurance claims data, and gene expression complementarity PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal focuses on the challenge of identifying drug repositioning candidates for Alzheimer’s Disease. The foundation of this work is the ReFRAME library, a set of ~13,000 compounds that includes nearly all small molecules that have been FDA-approved, reached clinical development, or undergone significant preclinical profiling. The ReFRAME library is being actively screened against a diverse cross-section of in vitro assays. This proposal pursues three distinct strategies for identifying repositioning candidates among the ReFRAME collection. First, we will create and mine a large and heterogeneous biomedical knowledge graph. We will use machine learning methods to identify repositioning candidates based on properties of the knowledge graph surrounding and joining each drug and disease. Second, we will mine a massive data set of insurance claims data for associations between drug use and the incidence or severity of Alzheimer’s Disease. Containing almost 7 billion medical claims and over 2 billion pharmacy claims, this data set represents the largest source of claims data available. Third, we will use concept of gene expression complementarity to identify repositioning candidates. We will generate a gene expression signature for every ReFRAME compound in three cell lines relevant to Alzheimer’s Disease, and we will screen for compounds that produce a signature that appear to reverse gene expression changes seen in Alzheimer’s Disease. After assembling repositioning candidates identified through all three of these methods, we will prioritize up to 100 compounds (or compound combinations) for further characterization and validation. These follow-up experiments will initially investigate the activity of these compounds in five cell-based assays to establish a mechanistic hypothesis on their mechanism of action in Alzheimer’s Disease. Secondary follow-up experiments may include validation in some combination of in vitro (including hiPSC-derived cerebrocortical neurons and/or organoids) and in vivo systems. We believe that the multifaceted approach described in this proposal offers the best possible chance at successfully identifying AD repositioning candidates. Moreover, this work will create methods and resources that will be useful to the broader scientific community, both for Alzheimer’s Disease and for other disease areas. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project focuses on discovering new treatments for Alzheimer’s Disease. We specifically are looking for drugs that are already approved (or were previously tested) to treat other diseases to see if they can be beneficial for Alzheimer’s Disease patients.

"Mechanism-Driven Virtual Adverse Outcome Pathway Modeling for Hepatotoxicity PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Experimental animal and clinical testing to evaluate hepatotoxicity demands extensive resources and long turnaround times. Utilization of computational models to directly predict the toxicity of new compounds is a promising strategy to reduce the cost of drug development and to screen the multitude of industrial chemicals and environmental contaminants currently lacking safety assessments. However, the current computational models for complex toxicity endpoints, such as hepatotoxicity, are not reliable for screening new compounds and face numerous challenges. Our recent studies have shown that traditional Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship modeling is applicable for relatively simple properties or toxicity endpoints with a clear mechanism, but fails to address complex bioactivities such as hepatotoxicity. The primary objective of this proposal is to develop novel mechanism-driven Virtual Adverse Outcome Pathway (vAOP) models for the fast and accurate assessment of hepatotoxicity in a high-throughput manner The resulting vAOP models will be experimentally validated using a complement of in vitro and ex vivo testing. We have generated a preliminary vAOP model based on the antioxidant response element (ARE) pathway that has undergone initial validation and refinement using in vitro testing. To this end, our project will generate novel predictive models for hepatotoxicity by applying 1) a virtual cellular stress pathway model to mechanism profiling and assessment of new compounds; 2) computational predictions to fill in the missing data for specific targets within the pathway; 3) in vitro experimental validation with three complementary bioassays; and 4) ex vivo experimental validation with pooled primary human hepatocytes capable of biochemical transformation. The scientific approach of this study is to develop a universal modeling workflow that can take advantage of all available short-term testing information, obtained from both computational predictions using novel machine learning approaches and in vitro experiments, for target compounds of interest. We will validate and use our modeling workflow to directly evaluate the hepatotoxicity of new compounds and prioritize candidates for validation in pooled primary human hepatocytes. The resulting workflow will be disseminated via a web portal for public users around the world with internet access. Importantly, this study will pave the way for the next generation of chemical toxicity assessment by reconstructing the modeling process through a combination of big data, computational modeling, and low cost in vitro experiments. To the best of our knowledge, the implementation of this project will lead to the first publicly available mechanisms-driven modeling and web- based prediction framework for complex chemical toxicity based on publicly-accessible big data. These deliverables will have a significant public health impact by not only prioritizing compounds for safety testing or new chemical development, but also revealing toxicity mechanisms. PROJECT NARRATIVE Hepatotoxicity is a leading safety concern in the development of new chemicals. We will create virtual “Adverse Outcome Pathway” models that will directly evaluate the hepatotoxicity potentials of chemicals using massive public toxicity data. The primary deliverable of this project will be a publically-accessible, web-based search engine to evaluate new chemicals for risk of hepatotoxicity.",Mechanism-Driven Virtual Adverse Outcome Pathway Modeling for Hepatotoxicity,9864299,R01ES031080,"['Antioxidants ', ' anti-oxidant ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Computers ', ' Cryopreservation ', ' Cryofixation ', ' cold preservation ', ' cold storage ', ' Data Sources ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Pollution ', ' environmental contaminant ', ' environmental contamination ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' In Vitro ', ' Industrialization ', ' Statutes and Laws ', ' Legislation ', ' Libraries ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic body system ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' Luciferases ', ' Luciferase Immunologic ', ' Marketing ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mining ', ' Online Systems ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' online computer ', ' web based ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Toxicology ', ' Translating ', ' Vertebrates ', ' Vertebrate Animals ', ' vertebrata ', ' Generations ', ' Drug Costs ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Custom ', ' injuries ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Biochemical ', ' Ensure ', ' Chemicals ', ' Chemical Structure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Hepatic Cells ', ' Hepatic Parenchymal Cell ', ' Liver Cells ', ' Hepatocyte ', ' Hepatotoxic effect ', ' Liver Toxicity ', ' Toxic effect on liver cells ', ' hepatic toxicity ', ' hepatoxicity ', ' Hepatotoxicity ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Internet ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Chemical Injury ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Test Result ', ' interest ', ' Cellular injury ', ' cell damage ', ' cellular damage ', ' damage to cells ', ' injury to cells ', ' cell injury ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' toxicant ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' Response Elements ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' drug development ', ' Proteomics ', ' QSAR ', ' Quantitiative Structure Activity Relationship ', ' Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship ', ' Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' Address ', ' Animal Testing ', ' Data ', ' in vitro Assay ', ' in vivo ', ' cell stress ', ' Cellular Stress ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' clinical test ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Nutraceutical ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' PubChem ', ' cost ', ' computational framework ', ' computer framework ', ' virtual ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' next generation ', ' Population ', ' transcriptomics ', ' combat ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' in vitro testing ', ' safety testing ', ' candidate validation ', ' ER stress ', ' endoplasmic reticulum stress ', ' adverse consequence ', ' adverse outcome ', ' screening ', ' Injury to Liver ', ' hepatic damage ', ' hepatic injury ', ' liver damage ', ' liver injury ', ' BigData ', ' Big Data ', ' developmental toxicity ', ' internet portal ', ' on-line portal ', ' online portal ', ' web-based portal ', ' web portal ', ' reproductive toxicity ', ' search engine ', ' computational toxicology ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep neural network ', ' safety assessment ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' Computer Models ', ' large data sets ', ' large datasets ', ' hepatocellular injury ', ' Data Pooling ', ' ']",NIEHS,RUTGERS THE STATE UNIV OF NJ CAMDEN,R01,2020,465692,NJ-01,0.1032082569850618
"MegaPredict for predicting natural product uses and their drug interactions Project Summary The objective of ‘MegaPredict’ is to enable scientists to generate predictions for a natural product (or any molecule) and identify targets for efficacy assessment as well as identify any potential liabilities. We are building on our previous work which has compiled a comprehensive collection of datasets for structure-activity data for a broad variety of disease targets and other properties, in a form ready for model building. All of these models utilize the many sources of curated open data, including ChEMBL, ToxCast etc. We have developed a prototype of MegaPredict that utilizes Bayesian algorithm and ECFP6 fingerprints to output a list of prioritized ‘targets’. We realize that neither the algorithm or the descriptors may be optimal therefore we propose to address this as we validate MegaPredict and develop a product over this proposal. Our team is suitably qualified to develop the software needed and we will leverage our large collaborator network to assist us in validating the activity of compounds. We will initially create a script to take a natural product and score it against many thousands of machine learning models then rank the outputs to propose efficacy targets. We will use over 12,000 ChEMBL derived target-assay / bioactivity groups extracted from the ChEMBL v24 database, as well as EPA Tox21 measurements and other public datasets, using methodology that we have already partially developed. We can repeat this process for over 200 published compounds and access the outputs versus what is known. We intend to compare how the approach performs with synthetic drugs or drug-like compounds as well as natural products. We will assess whether other machine learning algorithms and molecular descriptors can improve predictions. As we generate machine learning models such as Linear Logistic Regression, AdaBoost Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and deep neural networks (DNN) of varying depth we will assess the predictions for natural products and compare with the Bayesian approach. We will compare ECFP6 with other 2D, 3D descriptors and physicochemical properties in order to identify the optimal combination for generating predictions for natural products and compare how this differs for synthetic compounds. We will validate our predictions for natural product efficacy assessment. We will work closely with multiple academic groups to generate predictions for at least 20 natural products of interest against over 20 different targets or diseases. Our goal will be to identify potential targets that were previously unknown and then generate in vitro data inhouse or with academic collaborators. Develop a prototype user interface for input of a structure, processing an input molecule and output of prioritized targets and liabilities. We have developed multiple software prototypes (e. Assay Central, MegaTox, etc.) previously and will ensure a user-friendly interface and develop new visualization methods and algorithms for prioritizing potential predicted targets based on the outputs of thousands of machine learning models. In Phase I, we will use the software internally with collaborators to rapidly prototype it. In Phase II we will develop a commercial product, and greatly expand our validation by building a larger network of academic and industry partners that would help to prioritize features of most relevance. Using the machine learning models which we have for natural products is limited because ECFP6 fingerprints cannot distinguish between these very different classes of molecules. But this provides us with an opportunity by going for a ""pharmacophore"" style approach (ideally without using 3D conformations directly). We will therefore focus on developing a ‘3D shape-based fingerprint’ or developing a novel ‘2D fingerprint’ that captures the ‘3D shape’ for natural- and druglike molecules. Currently, the public datasets in ChEMBL and PubChem etc. are made up of mostly druglike molecules, but if we have fingerprints that can compare drug-like and natural product-like molecules then we can likely reliably use our MegaPredict models for natural products as well. We can also attempt to rank natural products with our ChEMBL models or we can look through catalogs of druglike compounds using models derived from natural products. That would be an important innovation. Additionally, in Phase II it would be important to see if we could find uses for natural products with any of the 7000 rare diseases. Developing software that predicts potential natural product drug interactions with various targets could be useful to regulatory organizations as well as the pharmaceutical industry and may broaden utility of being able to more effectively mix natural product and druglike compounds in models will have a profound effect on the value of cheminformatics in this arena. Project Narrative Natural products have long been a source of therapeutics for human healthcare. Yet, some of the challenges with developing natural product treatments are identifying potential human disease related targets and avoiding others that might lead to undesirable natural product-drug interactions. Now there is considerable data in the public domain for millions of molecules with thousands of targets and ADME/T related properties that it is possible to use a suite of machine learning models for prospective prediction and profiling of a molecule’s properties from structure alone. We aim to build on our preliminary efforts to date to create a prototype for MegaPredict using various machine learning models which will enable academic and industrial scientists to generate predictions for a natural product or any molecule of interest and identify potential targets for efficacy and toxicity liability assessment. We will experimentally validate these predictions in-house or through our network of collaborators.",MegaPredict for predicting natural product uses and their drug interactions,10055938,R43AT010585,"['Algorithms ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Chemistry ', ' Decision Trees ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Drug Industry ', ' Pharmaceutic Industry ', ' Pharmaceutical Industry ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Fingerprint ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' In Vitro ', ' Industrialization ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Literature ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Chemical Models ', ' Molecular Conformation ', ' Molecular Configuration ', ' Molecular Stereochemistry ', ' conformation ', ' conformational state ', ' Phenotype ', ' Phosphotransferases ', ' Kinases ', ' Phosphotransferase Gene ', ' Transphosphorylases ', ' Publishing ', ' Running ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' symposium ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Public Domains ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Ensure ', ' Bayesian Methodology ', ' Bayesian Statistical Method ', ' Bayesian approaches ', ' Bayesian classification method ', ' Bayesian classification procedure ', ' Bayesian posterior distribution ', ' Bayesian Method ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Measurement ', ' Descriptor ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Catalogs ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Viral ', ' interest ', ' pharmacophore ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Orphan Disease ', ' Rare Disorder ', ' orphan disorder ', ' Rare Diseases ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' G Protein-Complex Receptor ', ' G Protein-Coupled Receptor Genes ', ' GPCR ', ' G-Protein-Coupled Receptors ', ' Drug Interactions ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' drug discovery ', ' chemical informatics ', ' cheminformatics ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Natural Product Drug ', ' in vivo ', ' Collection ', ' Validation ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Output ', ' PubChem ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' process reproducibility ', ' process repeatability ', ' prospective ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' user-friendly ', ' web interface ', ' human disease ', ' commercial application ', ' prototype ', ' industrial partnership ', ' industry partnership ', ' industry partner ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' synthetic drug ', ' model building ', ' Natural Products ', ' open-source data ', ' open science ', ' open data ', ' predictive tools ', ' web-based tool ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep neural network ', ' random forest ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' Bayesian machine learning ', ' Bayesian learning ', ' Visualization ', ' support vector machine ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NCCIH,"COLLABORATIONS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.",R43,2020,155686,NC-02,0.03958024220854181
"Altering Hepatitis B Virus assembly through pharmacological intervention Project Summary/Abstract Viruses are one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) being one of the most infectious and prevalent among them. Roughly 250 million people worldwide suffer from chronic HBV infection, including 1-2 million in the United States. Of those infected, approximately 15-25% will develop se- rious liver problems, including cirrhosis, cancer, and ultimately failure, leading to 600,000 deaths annually. While therapies exist to manage chronic HBV infection, all target viral genomic processes such as reverse transcription and DNA replication, and none provide a cure due to viral persistence and resistance. A promising orthogonal approach to eliminating infection is to target HBV's capsid, the protein shell that encapsulates the viral genome. The Finn laboratory has previously developed compounds that induce the misdirected assembly of non-functional HBV capsids, showing that small molecules have the power to affect the structures of these large multi-protein assemblies. While much is known about the structures of the intermolecular interactions with these compounds identiﬁed after the fact, little about the dynamics of such interactions has been explored, and a predictive under- standing of functional (antiviral) binding has yet to be developed. Both deﬁciencies will begin to be addressed in this program. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations coupled with in vitro experiments on HepAD38 cells, the PIs have identiﬁed seven compounds based on motifs previously unknown to interact with HBV that target the capsid assembly process. These compounds bind in a known pocket at the interface of two capsid-protein (Cp) dimers, possess moderate antiviral activity, and low toxicity. In the ﬁrst aim, using docking, free-energy perturba- tion, and synthetic chemistry, the PIs will optimize the lead compound to improve its efﬁcacy against HBV. In the second aim, using molecular dynamics simulations, advanced free-energy calculations, and experimental assays on different HBV protein oligomers, up to and including the whole virus capsid, the PIs will determine how small molecules interfere with capsid assembly. Both aims will beneﬁt from using a machine-learning-based classiﬁ- cation scheme as well as novel enhanced sampling methods. The lessons learned here concerning how small molecules can re-direct the assembly pathway into unproductive conformations can be generalized for application to other viruses. Project Narrative In spite of the dramatic increase in our understanding of the structure and properties of hepatitis B virus (HBV), this pathogen remains a major threat to human health. That knowledge also makes HBV an important test case for new antiviral strategies. This project aims to limit the impact of HBV by using computer simulations and synthetic chemistry to develop an improved understanding of the assembly process of HBV as well as new drugs that can eliminate HBV infection in ways that may be generalized to other pathogenic viruses.",Altering Hepatitis B Virus assembly through pharmacological intervention,10051923,R01AI148740,"['Affect ', ' Antiviral Agents ', ' Antiviral Drugs ', ' Antivirals ', ' anti-viral agents ', ' anti-viral drugs ', ' anti-virals ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Capsid ', ' Cations ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' computational simulation ', ' computerized simulation ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' HIV-1 ', ' HIV-I ', ' HIV1 ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus 1 ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' In Vitro ', ' Infection ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic body system ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' Methods ', ' Molecular Conformation ', ' Molecular Configuration ', ' Molecular Stereochemistry ', ' conformation ', ' conformational state ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Protein Conformation ', ' Reverse Transcription ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Viral Genome ', ' virus genome ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' viral infection ', ' virus infection ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' Virus ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Encapsulated ', ' Failure ', ' viral assembly ', ' Virus Assembly ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Viral ', ' chronic HBV infection ', ' chronic hepatitis B virus infection ', ' Chronic Hepatitis B ', ' dimer ', ' intermolecular interaction ', ' Molecular Dynamics Simulation ', ' molecular dynamics ', ' success ', ' Cryo-electron Microscopy ', ' Electron Cryomicroscopy ', ' cryo-EM ', ' cryoEM ', ' Cryoelectron Microscopy ', ' DNA Replication ', ' DNA Synthesis ', ' DNA biosynthesis ', ' protein oligomer ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Free Energy ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' protein protein interaction ', ' drug development ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Coat Proteins ', ' Viral Coat Proteins ', ' Viral Outer Coat Protein ', ' Capsid Proteins ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' small molecule ', ' Address ', ' protein structures ', ' proteins structure ', ' protein structure ', ' Protein Dynamics ', ' Synthetic Chemistry ', ' Synthesis Chemistry ', ' Classification Scheme ', ' Scheme ', ' Process ', ' Docking ', ' Modification ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cirrhotic ', ' Cirrhosis ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' pathogen ', ' Coupled ', ' resistant ', ' Resistance ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' HBV ', ' Homologous Serum Hepatitis Virus ', ' Hepatitis B Virus ', ' lead optimization ', ' viral pathogen ', ' pathogenic virus ', ' virus genomics ', ' viral genomics ', ' ']",NIAID,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2020,407510,GA-05,0.03155967417198096
"Phenotypic assay for drug discovery and personalized medicine based on real-time vibrational spectroscopy enhanced by plasmonic metasurfaces Abstract The goal of this research is to develop a new spectroscopic technique – Time-dependent Infrared Reflection Spectroscopy Assay (TIRSA) – that will enable us to measure the real-time spectral response of a cell to various pharmacological compounds. The uniqueness of TIRSA is that it exploits infrared-reflective plasmonic (gold) metasurfaces to detect, as a function of time, biochemical changes in close proximity of cellular membranes, as well as cytoskeleton reorganization occurring. The optical spectra obtained over the course of several hours after administering the drug will be used to identify its effects on signaling pathways without any labels because vibrational fingerprints of biomolecules are the natural labels. Unlike time-consuming cytotoxic assays, the TIRSA can be potentially as short as several hours, thereby addressing one of the most serious deficiencies of phenotypic assays: their low throughput. Powerful techniques of machine learning (ML) will be used to process the enormous amount of biochemical information obtained by TIRSA, and to conduct supervised and unsupervised data analysis that will be based on large libraries of spectral cellular responses to single-target chemical compounds such as kinase inhibitors and others. New laser-based hardware for TIRSA will enable high sensitivity, time and space resolution. Relevance Statement: The goal of our program is to demonstrate the feasibility of combining time-dependent infrared spectroscopy to determine the Mode of Action (MOA) of various compounds, including apoptosis- inducing cytotoxic compounds as well as kinase inhibitors.

"Development of a novel pharmaco-EEG based, high-throughput screening platform to facilitate drug discovery for psychiatric disorders PROJECT SUMMARY The high rate of failure in CNS drug discovery, in particular of the first-in-class therapeutics with new modes of action, highlights a clear unmet need to improve the success rate in drug discovery for psychiatric disorders. One well-known issue is the poor ability of current bioassays and animal models to predict the efficacy and side-effects of compounds. In response, there is a steady growth in the use of electroencephalogram (EEG) in clinical trials in recent years. Pharmaceutical companies are incorporating EEG more often in their preclinical drug discovery efforts because the high degree of translatability of EEG from rodents to humans makes it ideal to use in de-risking programs in drug discovery. Moreover, quantitative EEG (qEEG) is an objective measurement of brain activity with a high test-retest reliability and considerable predictive, face, and construct validity. Additionally, well-documented literature shows that certain classes of drugs elicit different EEG fingerprints, suggesting that EEG yields pharmaco-dynamic signatures specific to pharmacological action and can be used to enable classification of drugs based on the effects of the EEG. Further, EEG can be used to rapidly screen compounds for potential activity at specific pharmacological targets and provide valuable information for guiding the early stages of drug development. However, to date, no EEG-based tool is broadly available to be used to predict the therapeutic utility of unknown compounds for drug discovery in psychiatric disorders. In order to develop such a tool, PsychoGenics, Inc., is leveraging our existing expertise in performing high-throughput pharmaco-sleep-EEG studies and our established proprietary machine learning approach to develop a novel EEG-based drug discovery platform that can predict therapeutic indications or underlying mechanism of action (MOA; i.e. the neurotransmitter system/receptor targets) of unknown compounds for psychiatric disorders. Our aims are 1) to generate a quantitative electroencephalogram (QEEG) database of compounds with a known mechanism and therapeutic value in mice, and 2) to develop a classifier using supervised machine learning. The success of this Phase I SBIR project will result in a novel EEG-based drug discovery platform that can predict therapeutic indications and MOA of new compounds based on their EEG profiles. In a future Phase II project, we will 1) add in auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) database, 2) test our EEGCube by conducting a phenotypic drug discovery project with our established collaborator (see letters of support), 3) investigate whether integrating the EEGcube database with our SmartCube® database of same compounds helps better understand the circuitry responsible for behavioral responses and/or achieves even greater prediction power in identifying therapeutic indication of novel compounds and 4) explore EEG signatures of transgenic mouse models of disease and investigate use of their signatures to identify potential therapies for the respective diseases based on EEG. PROJECT NARRATIVE There is an unmet need to improve success rate in drug discovery for psychiatric disorders due to the high rate of failure. Given the high degree of translatability of electroencephalogram (EEG) from rodents to humans, PsychoGenics, Inc., proposes to develop a novel EEG-based drug discovery platform that can predict therapeutic indications, underlying mechanism of action, and/or compound liabilities to guide the early stages of drug development.","Development of a novel pharmaco-EEG based, high-throughput screening platform to facilitate drug discovery for psychiatric disorders",9983443,R43MH121136,"['Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Central Nervous System Diseases ', ' CNS Diseases ', ' CNS disorder ', ' Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Auditory Evoked Potentials ', ' Auditory Evoked Response ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Fingerprint ', ' Future ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Libraries ', ' Literature ', ' Methods ', ' Transgenic Mice ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Neurotransmitters ', ' Nerve Transmitter Substances ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Rattus ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Rat ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Rest ', ' Rights ', ' Risk ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Sleep ', ' Sleep Stages ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Antipsychotic Agents ', ' Antipsychotic Drugs ', ' Antipsychotics ', ' Major Tranquilizers ', ' Major Tranquilizing Agents ', ' Neuroleptic Agents ', ' Neuroleptic Drugs ', ' Neuroleptics ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Ensure ', ' Failure ', ' insight ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Measurement ', ' Letters ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Frequencies ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' drug classification ', ' Performance ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' receptor ', ' success ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' Pharmacologic Actions ', ' novel ', ' disorder model ', ' Disease model ', ' Pharmacodynamics ', ' response ', ' drug development ', ' High Throughput Assay ', ' high throughput screening ', ' drug discovery ', ' Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' Brain region ', ' Dose ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Electroencephalogram ', ' Behavioral ', ' Output ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' behavior response ', ' behavioral response ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' supervised learning ', ' side effect ', ' PK/PD ', ' pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics ', ' ']",NIMH,"PSYCHOGENICS, INC.",R43,2020,88432,NJ-05,0.08211328472806971
