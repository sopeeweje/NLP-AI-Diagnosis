"Social and Statistical Mechanisms of Prelinguistic Vocal Learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): How do infants learn to produce the sounds of their language? The vocal abilities of infants change dramatically over the first year of life. Beginning with the earliest, immature vocalizations, infants make rapid progress, typically producing their first words by 12 months of age. Along the way, they begin to produce speech-like syllables and to structure sequences of syllables in accordance with the phonological rules of their language environment. While the vocal achievements of the first year are well-described, not nearly as much is known about the mechanisms of change that drive vocal development. Most work focuses on the maturation of the vocal tract, but studies of vocal development in songbirds found that there are also social sources of developmental change. For example, young male cowbirds (Molothrus ater) rely on the reactions of females to shape their immature sounds into functional song. Based on the avian work, the investigators' preliminary studies have shown that infants can learn new patterns of vocalizing from caregivers' reactions to their babbling. How do infants use social feedback to create new, more developmentally advanced, vocalizations? The goal of the proposed research is to understand the mechanisms by which infants incorporate the phonological patterns of their language into their vocal repertoires. Based on preliminary studies, the investigators hypothesize that the contingent responses of caregivers to babbling facilitate infants' statistical learning of the phonological patterns of their language. To investigate this hypothesis, the variability and temporal contingency of speech to 9-month-old infants will be manipulated to assess their effects on vocal learning. The proposed research has important implications for educating parents in providing optimal learning environments for their infants. An understanding of the role of socially guided learning in speech and language could be used to help parents to be more sensitive to their infants' behavior in ways that would facilitate development. Investigating social influences on phonological development can also contribute to the study of speech-language pathology and of processes underlying both successful and disordered communicative development.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: By illuminating mechanisms by which infants learn to produce the sounds of their language from caregivers' contingent speech, the findings could inform interventions for disordered language development. The results could also be used to help parents and child care providers create social environments that foster and support language growth. Eventually, this research could be used to design preventive programs for infants with a higher risk of language delay (e.g., children with Down Syndrome or SLI).           Project Relevance By illuminating mechanisms by which infants learn to produce the sounds of their language from caregivers' contingent speech, the findings could inform interventions for disordered language development.

"Cross-Situational statistical word learning:behaviors, mechanisms and constraints    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There are an infinite number of possible word-to-world pairings in naturalistic learning environments. Previous studies to solve this mapping problem focus on linguistic, social, and representational constraints at a single moment. The proposed research asks if the indeterminacy problem may also be solved in another way, not in a single trial, but across trials, not in a single encounter with a word and potential referent but cross-situationally. We argue that a cross-situational learning strategy based on computing distributional statistics across words, across referents, and most importantly across the co-occurrences of these two can ultimately map individual words to the right referents despite the logical ambiguity in individual learning moments. Thus, the proposed research focuses on: (1) documenting cross-situational learning in infants from 10- to 16-months of age, (2) investigating the kinds of mechanisms that underlie this learning through both theoretical simulations and experimental studies, and (3) studying how statistical learning builds on itself accumulatively. Understanding those mechanisms and how they might go wrong or be bolstered are surely fundamental to understanding the origins of developmental language disorders that delay or alter early lexical learning. Implementing procedures to benefit children with developmental disorders typically involves altering or highlighting aspects of the learning environment.

"The origin and significance of appearance-based stereotypes.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research program examines the origins, consequences, and significance of appearance-based stereotypes. One goal is to understand the cognitive mechanisms underlying the development of the universal preferences shown by infants, children, and adults for attractive faces. Why do even young infants prefer to look at attractive rather than unattractive faces and when do stereotypical expectations become attached to these visual preferences? By what processes do infants come to associate attractiveness with positive attributes and to associate unattractiveness with negative attributes? Given infants as young as 12 months of age display differential treatment of attractive and unattractive individuals they may have some primitive knowledge of appearance-based stereotypes much earlier than previously assumed. A second goal of the research is to form a better understanding of the consequences of appearance- based stereotypes. How do children behave toward others based on appearance? Do non-prototypical faces elicit negative affect from perceivers and, if so, how might this lead to stigmatization?

"Infant Statistical Learning in Natural Language Acquisition    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Infants are adept at tracking statistical regularities to segment words in continuous speech. Researchers have documented infants' learning abilities using highly simplified artificial languages as speech input. However, natural language is replete with variability. Infants listening to speech encounter different speakers, different word lengths, and numerous other dimensions of complexity. The proposed experiments will use speech that captures key aspects of the natural variation observed in infants' language environments to test whether infants use statistical learning mechanisms in identifying word boundaries. This research will provide a rigorous test of whether statistical learning is in fact linked to early language acquisition. Specific Aim 1 is to examine how infants segment words given variability in utterance types-specifically, the presence of both continuous speech and isolated words. A preliminary study showed that isolated words enhance infants' attention to statistical regularities in fluent, natural speech. Experiment 1 will test the hypothesis that hearing words in isolation helps infants discover other words in continuous speech. Experiment 2 will explore word segmentation given variation in voices, testing whether isolated words enhance statistical learning when speech comes from multiple talkers. Specific Aim 2 is to investigate how variability in language experience influences infants' subsequent detection of statistical regularities in fluent speech. In Experiment 3, infants will first receive brief laboratory exposure to novel isolated words. This pre-familiarization is expected to constrain infants' abilities to establish word boundaries in continuous speech. Experiment 4 will test whether cross-linguistic differences in the proportion of multisyllabic words in infant-directed speech shape infants' word segmentation abilities. Spanish-learning infants, who hear far more multisyllabic words than English-learning infants over the first year, are expected to show greater facility in segmenting trisyllabic words from continuous speech than English-learning infants. The results will assess the degree to which previous learning leads to expectations that facilitate processing future speech, or whether infants' computational abilities operate continuously at each moment in time. The outcomes of these studies will inform future research exploring statistical learning abilities in young children with emergent language impairments.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this research is to understand how typically developing infants discover structure in the complex speech they hear from caregivers. Future studies will use these tasks to assess language learning in children exhibiting difficulties with language (e.g., children at risk for specific language impairment, children with emergent autism spectrum disorder, or deaf children with cochlear implants). The eventual goals are to investigate whether the mechanisms responsible for learning are compromised in these clinical populations, and to develop more appropriate tools for early diagnosis and intervention.           The goal of this research is to understand how typically developing infants discover structure in the complex speech they hear from caregivers.

"Statistical learning of multiple patterns in infants, adults, and monkeys    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the present grant application is to understand how a naive learner collects distributional information from the environment and makes an implicit decision that the corpus of input contains either a single structure or multiple structures. Mature learners are incredibly facile at interpreting information in a context-specific manner, thereby partitioning the input into two or more sub-structures. We will investigate this question of context-specific statistical learning by studying two types of naove learners - human infants and tamarin monkeys - as well as mature adults. The specific objective of the proposed research is to determine whether and how infants learn that there are multiple patterns of information embedded in streams of speech, or that there are multiple words that refer to the same object, and to determine whether context-specific statistical learning has species-specific biases. Two types of experimental designs will be used to study context-specific statistical learning. The first uses a single change in the underlying structure. A variety of contextual cues will be introduced to signal that the underlying structure has undergone a change, and the dependent measure is whether the learner has acquired the first, the second, both the first and the second, or neither structures. The second design uses two alternating structures that are signaled by a variety of stimulus cues to partition the two underlying structures. It is important to note that in both of these designs, if the learner aggregates the structural information across the entire corpus, rather than partitioning the corpus into two subsets, no learning is possible. Thus, these designs test the ability of the learner to extract the contextual cues that partition the input into subsets. The implications of the proposed studies are fundamental to any theory of learning, but particularly to the kind of implicit (passive exposure) statistical learning that is thought to characterize much of early human development in many domains. Infants must learn - by a combination of sensitivity to distributional patterns and innate biases - that patterns of information are context-specific, as in the case of bilingualism. Our proposed experiments will extend our recent studies of human adults by determining (a) whether infants show the same pattern of learning biases (primacy effects) and context-sensitivity (to talker voice), (b) whether tamarin monkeys show these same biases and context effects, and (c) what the limits of context-specific statistical learning are in human adults and infants in both word segmentation and referential tasks.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Language development is one of the hallmarks of the human species, yet it is difficult to study because of the huge variation in early exposure to different amounts of linguistic input. The use of artificial languages that are acquired in the lab over a few hours provides a window on the mechanisms of language development. We will study language learning in the lab to gain a unique perspective on how the infants and adults learn the patterns of words in streams of speech and contrast this with performance in nonhuman primates. These studies will not only reveal a basic mechanism of language learning, but also establish benchmarks against which language delay can be compared. Moreover, understanding the mechanisms that lead to successful acquisition in normal infants and adults can help to identify loci of language disorders and design methods for remediating disorders.           Language development is one of the hallmarks of the human species, yet it is difficult to study because of the huge variation in early exposure to different amounts of linguistic input.

"The Development and Neural Bases of Emotion Processing     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An important function of the brain is to scan incoming sensory information for the presence of biologically relevant features and process and act on this information. For humans, the most salient signals of emotion are often social in nature, such as expressions of fear or anger. The goal of the current competing renewal is to study the nature and neural architecture of emotion processing across the first three years of life. Five-, seven-, and twelve-month-old infants, as well as three-year-old typically developing children will serve as participants across 5 specific aims. Aim 1 seeks to examine the neural and cardiac correlates of the infant's ability to process emotion in both faces and non-face stimuli. Aim 2 examines a similar question, except that autonomic activity (skin conductance and pupil diameter) will be recorded in conjunction with functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS). Aim 3 seeks to elucidate the neural networks involved in emotion processing, and will do so by using state-of-the-art signal processing software to extract theta activity from the ongoing EEG. Aim 4 will focus on individual differences in emotion processing viewed through the lens of genetics; specifically, all infants serving as participants in Aims 1 and 2 will be genotyped, with most attention focused on 5 SNPs, with an additional 5 SNPs serving as a secondary aim. All SNPS have been shown to be relevant to emotion processing in both humans and non-human species. Finally, in Aim 5 we examine whether early biases in emotion processing (i.e., whether infants show greater visual or neural activity to one emotion vs. another; e.g., fear) predict (or are associated with) behavioral inhibition and anxiety. Although the current project focuses on typically developing children, this work has enormous implications for children and adults who suffer from deficits in social-emotional communication. First, this work seeks to explicate the ontogeny of facial emotion processing; an ability that likely provides a foundation upon which higher-level social communication builds. As a result, it may well be the case that errors in this ability that occur early in development can develop into more insidious deficits that occur later i development. Second, the approach adopted in this project is highly innovative, and can easily be extended to various clinical populations, such as toddlers with autism or children diagnosed with depression or bipolar illness.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Prior to the onset of language, infants and adults primarily communicate through non-verbal channels. Of particular importance is the infant's ability to decode facial expressions of emotion, an ability that is often compromised in children with autism or who has been maltreated and in adults with schizophrenia and bipolar illness. The goal of the current proposal is to examine the development and neural bases of emotion perception and recognition.              Prior to the onset of language, infants and adults primarily communicate through non-verbal channels.

"Statistical learning of multiple patterns in infants, adults, and monkeys    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the present grant application is to understand how a naive learner collects distributional information from the environment and makes an implicit decision that the corpus of input contains either a single structure or multiple structures. Mature learners are incredibly facile at interpreting information in a context-specific manner, thereby partitioning the input into two or more sub-structures. We will investigate this question of context-specific statistical learning by studying two types of naove learners - human infants and tamarin monkeys - as well as mature adults. The specific objective of the proposed research is to determine whether and how infants learn that there are multiple patterns of information embedded in streams of speech, or that there are multiple words that refer to the same object, and to determine whether context-specific statistical learning has species-specific biases. Two types of experimental designs will be used to study context-specific statistical learning. The first uses a single change in the underlying structure. A variety of contextual cues will be introduced to signal that the underlying structure has undergone a change, and the dependent measure is whether the learner has acquired the first, the second, both the first and the second, or neither structures. The second design uses two alternating structures that are signaled by a variety of stimulus cues to partition the two underlying structures. It is important to note that in both of these designs, if the learner aggregates the structural information across the entire corpus, rather than partitioning the corpus into two subsets, no learning is possible. Thus, these designs test the ability of the learner to extract the contextual cues that partition the input into subsets. The implications of the proposed studies are fundamental to any theory of learning, but particularly to the kind of implicit (passive exposure) statistical learning that is thought to characterize much of early human development in many domains. Infants must learn - by a combination of sensitivity to distributional patterns and innate biases - that patterns of information are context-specific, as in the case of bilingualism. Our proposed experiments will extend our recent studies of human adults by determining (a) whether infants show the same pattern of learning biases (primacy effects) and context-sensitivity (to talker voice), (b) whether tamarin monkeys show these same biases and context effects, and (c) what the limits of context-specific statistical learning are in human adults and infants in both word segmentation and referential tasks.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Language development is one of the hallmarks of the human species, yet it is difficult to study because of the huge variation in early exposure to different amounts of linguistic input. The use of artificial languages that are acquired in the lab over a few hours provides a window on the mechanisms of language development. We will study language learning in the lab to gain a unique perspective on how the infants and adults learn the patterns of words in streams of speech and contrast this with performance in nonhuman primates. These studies will not only reveal a basic mechanism of language learning, but also establish benchmarks against which language delay can be compared. Moreover, understanding the mechanisms that lead to successful acquisition in normal infants and adults can help to identify loci of language disorders and design methods for remediating disorders.

"Infant Statistical Learning in Natural Language Acquisition    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Infants are adept at tracking statistical regularities to segment words in continuous speech. Researchers have documented infants' learning abilities using highly simplified artificial languages as speech input. However, natural language is replete with variability. Infants listening to speech encounter different speakers, different word lengths, and numerous other dimensions of complexity. The proposed experiments will use speech that captures key aspects of the natural variation observed in infants' language environments to test whether infants use statistical learning mechanisms in identifying word boundaries. This research will provide a rigorous test of whether statistical learning is in fact linked to early language acquisition. Specific Aim 1 is to examine how infants segment words given variability in utterance types-specifically, the presence of both continuous speech and isolated words. A preliminary study showed that isolated words enhance infants' attention to statistical regularities in fluent, natural speech. Experiment 1 will test the hypothesis that hearing words in isolation helps infants discover other words in continuous speech. Experiment 2 will explore word segmentation given variation in voices, testing whether isolated words enhance statistical learning when speech comes from multiple talkers. Specific Aim 2 is to investigate how variability in language experience influences infants' subsequent detection of statistical regularities in fluent speech. In Experiment 3, infants will first receive brief laboratory exposure to novel isolated words. This pre-familiarization is expected to constrain infants' abilities to establish word boundaries in continuous speech. Experiment 4 will test whether cross-linguistic differences in the proportion of multisyllabic words in infant-directed speech shape infants' word segmentation abilities. Spanish-learning infants, who hear far more multisyllabic words than English-learning infants over the first year, are expected to show greater facility in segmenting trisyllabic words from continuous speech than English-learning infants. The results will assess the degree to which previous learning leads to expectations that facilitate processing future speech, or whether infants' computational abilities operate continuously at each moment in time. The outcomes of these studies will inform future research exploring statistical learning abilities in young children with emergent language impairments.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this research is to understand how typically developing infants discover structure in the complex speech they hear from caregivers. Future studies will use these tasks to assess language learning in children exhibiting difficulties with language (e.g., children at risk for specific language impairment, children with emergent autism spectrum disorder, or deaf children with cochlear implants). The eventual goals are to investigate whether the mechanisms responsible for learning are compromised in these clinical populations, and to develop more appropriate tools for early diagnosis and intervention.

"The origin and significance of appearance-based stereotypes.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research program examines the origins, consequences, and significance of appearance-based stereotypes. One goal is to understand the cognitive mechanisms underlying the development of the universal preferences shown by infants, children, and adults for attractive faces. Why do even young infants prefer to look at attractive rather than unattractive faces and when do stereotypical expectations become attached to these visual preferences? By what processes do infants come to associate attractiveness with positive attributes and to associate unattractiveness with negative attributes? Given infants as young as 12 months of age display differential treatment of attractive and unattractive individuals they may have some primitive knowledge of appearance-based stereotypes much earlier than previously assumed. A second goal of the research is to form a better understanding of the consequences of appearance- based stereotypes. How do children behave toward others based on appearance? Do non-prototypical faces elicit negative affect from perceivers and, if so, how might this lead to stigmatization? What are the social, physical, and mental health risks associated with appearance-based stereotypes? Because the intent of this research is to provide a full understanding of the mechanisms underlying the development of preferences, attitudes, and stereotypes based on facial appearance, a multi- method, converging evidence approach, beginning in infancy is required. This project includes standard behavioral measures widely used in the developmental literature including infant looking behavior with physiological measures (EEG, ERP, & EMG). Physiological data (e.g. EEG recorded brain activity) will be correlated with a behavioral response and/or a measure of attitudes. The ultimate goal of this research will be to ameliorate the negative consequences associated with appearance-based stereotypes.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rudimentary stereotypes are the result of three innate information-processing mechanisms: Cognitive averaging, categorization, and statistical learning. We propose a multi-component model of development in which infants bootstrap simple preferences and associations into complex beliefs and attitudes.

"Optimal neural and behavioral markers for learning to learn during infancy     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human infants are confronted with a complex world that is filled with ambiguity. Not only are many different features and dimensions of information present in the environment, but these cues are often unrelated to any reinforcement or feedback. There are two solutions to learning in a complex and ambiguous environment: (a) innate constraints on the cues selected for processing (bottom-up), or (b) rapid learning-to-learn mechanisms that assess cues (top-down). Learned top-down mechanisms of information selection may be tuned more to specific task demands, and thus more useful for learning. Given how much infants have to learn over the first two years of life, it is not efficient to use mainly slow but precise (top-down) search methods. My hypothesis is that the developmental progression of learning how to learn requires using bottom-up information in a systematic way, while creating top-down buffers against bottom- up distraction. The experiments in the research plan will test this hypothesis, with each experiment evaluating an additional level of learning. Sophisticated behavioral techniques (i.e., both table- and head-mounted eye- tracking) and complementary state-of-the-art neuroimaging methods (i.e., functional near-infrared spectroscopy [fNIRS], measuring spatially-localized neural activation via non-invasive light probes on the scalp), as well as data mining tools applied to infant eye movement data, will examine how infants learn to learn from both computer displays and in naturalistic settings.  There are four specific aims in this research program: 1) to establish a new, robust measure of learning with both behavioral and neural measures, 2) to investigate how attentional deployment can optimally improve learning, 3) to apply the learning paradigm to the natural environment, and 4) to conduct microanalyses on and to develop computational models of infant eye movements. The training component focuses on learning to use two state-of-the-art methods in infancy research (a head-mounted eye-tracker and fNIRS), and learning to use innovative data mining tools to analyze patterns of infant eye movements to link looking behavior to cognitive abilities. This training program is essential for the applicant's career goal of identifying the optimal strategies for learning to learn that will lead to training regimens for populations with learning difficulties.  The findings will benefit researchers within the larger community of developmental science, as well as artificial intelligence, perceptual learning, education, animal learning, machine learning, and evolutionary psychology. This work will contribute to a foundational understanding of the dynamics of selective attention and learning in typical development, which in turn would inform populations with learning difficulties.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This multi-disciplinary research program will indicate signatures of optimal attentional deployment for efficient learning among distractions via converging evidence from behavioral and neuroimaging methods and data mining tools.

"CRCNS: Information Flow in the Brain During Language and Meaning Comprehension DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the past ten years a good deal has been learned from fMRI studies about the spatial patterns of neural activation used by the human brain to represent meanings of words and concepts. Much less is understood about the time evolution of this neural activity, including the temporally interrelated sub-processes the brain employs during the hundreds of milliseconds it takes to comprehend a single word, or the more complex processes it uses to construct and encode meaning of entire sentences as the words arrive one by one. We propose research to study, and to build computational models of, the detailed spatial and temporal neural activity observed during the comprehension of single words, phrases, sentences, and stories. This proposed research will specifically target the following questions: ""What information is encoded by neural activity where and when, and by which subprocesses in the brain, during the time it takes to comprehend a single word in isolation?"" ""What is the flow of information encoded when a newly sensed word first activates sensory cortex, then later results in neural activation encoding the word meaning?"" ""How does the brain integrate a newly encountered word in the context of earlier words in the sentence or phrase, to compose the meaning representation of the multi-word phrase or sentence?"" and ""How do semantic expectations and demands, together with syntactic sentence structure alter the processing of words, compared to processing the same words in isolation, or as an unstructured set such as {kick, Joe, ball}?"" To study these questions we will (1) devise novel experimental protocols to probe the flow of information encoded in neural signals during word and sentence processing, (2) collect new brain image data using both fMRI to achieve spatial resolution of a few millimeters, and MEG to achieve temporal resolution of a few milliseconds, (3) develop and apply novel machine learning approaches to build computational models that integrate and that predict this combined experimental data. Our goal is to develop an increasingly accurate computational model of how the brain comprehends words, phrases and sentences - a model that makes testable predictions about the neural activity observed in response to novel language stimuli. Intellectual Merit: This collaborative research brings together advanced machine learning algorithms with novel experimental protocols for MEG and fMRI brain imaging to advance our understanding of two fundamental open questions about the human brain: how does the brain represent meaning, and what neuro-cognitive processes construct that meaning piece-by-piece from perceived language stimuli? Broader Impacts: If successful, this research will impact a broad range of communities, including (1) cognitive neuroscience and computational linguistics, providing improved understanding of language processing in the brain, (2) machine learning, by driving the development of new methods for time series and latent variable analysis, integrating multiple data sets, and incorporating diverse background knowledge as priors, (3) clinical studies of brain pathologies, especially those related to language processing, and informing treatment strategies for developmental and acquired language disorders (4) education of graduates, undergraduates and the general public, through dissemination of technical articles, teaching materials, and news about our work in the public press.

"Measurement of the time course of statistical learning in word segmentation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Statistical learning refers to a wide variety of phenomena, many of which have been argued to be related to language acquisition. However, there is little agreement on the process that underlies statistical learning. Several different accounts have been proposed, but it has been difficult to differentiate between these accounts as many converge on the same end result of learning. To identify the process responsible for statistical learning, it is necessary to more closely examine behavioral data that can characterize the dynamic characteristics of learning over the course of exposure. The objective of the current project is to develop and apply a novel method for examining statistical learning of linguistic materials. This method will provide more comprehensive and sensitive results than prior methods, which will enable these experiments to distinguish between theories of statistical learning in a way that has not been previously possible. In these experiments, participants will be exposed to a stream of syllables made up for nonsense words. Within this stream, words consistently co-occur, while syllable conjunctions formed across word boundaries are less predictable. Participants will be asked to listen for a particular syllable within the speech stream, and respond with a button press when they hear it. For some of these participants, the syllable will occur in an unpredictable location (for example, go in golabu is relatively unpredictable, because it can occur after the end of any word in the speech stream). For other participants, the syllable will occur in a predictable location (for example, bu in golabu is consistently signaled by the presence of both go and la). The experiments outlined in this proposal are a first step towards a process-based, mechanistic account of statistical learning. The first experiment demonstrates that this novel methodology is feasible, and will assess the extent to which the serial reaction time measure correlates with more standard post-test measures. The second and third experiments seek to test process-level predictions of a theory of statistical learning. Experiment 2 assesses the extent to which working memory is related to performance in the task, especially on different word lengths. Experiment 3 assesses a proposal about how chunking might be supplemented by processes of comparison to make learning of non-adjacent regularities possible. Finally, Experiment 4 asks how multiple cues to segmentation are integrated while learning is occurring in real time. By identifying the dynamic characteristics of learning over the course of exposure to the input, this research will test and refine theories of statistical learning in ways that have not previously been possible.       This research proposal will provide insight into the mechanisms underlying language learning. Understanding these mechanisms is critically important for designing interventions that improve language acquisition in both atypically developing children, and adults struggling to acquire a second language.

Mature learners are incredibly facile at interpreting information in a context-specific manner, thereby partitioning the input into two or more sub-structures. We will investigate this question of context-specific statistical learning by studying two types of naove learners - human infants and tamarin monkeys - as well as mature adults. The specific objective of the proposed research is to determine whether and how infants learn that there are multiple patterns of information embedded in streams of speech, or that there are multiple words that refer to the same object, and to determine whether context-specific statistical learning has species-specific biases. Two types of experimental designs will be used to study context-specific statistical learning. The first uses a single change in the underlying structure. A variety of contextual cues will be introduced to signal that the underlying structure has undergone a change, and the dependent measure is whether the learner has acquired the first, the second, both the first and the second, or neither structures. The second design uses two alternating structures that are signaled by a variety of stimulus cues to partition the two underlying structures. It is important to note that in both of these designs, if the learner aggregates the structural information across the entire corpus, rather than partitioning the corpus into two subsets, no learning is possible. Thus, these designs test the ability of the learner to extract the contextual cues that partition the input into subsets. The implications of the proposed studies are fundamental to any theory of learning, but particularly to the kind of implicit (passive exposure) statistical learning that is thought to characterize much of early human development in many domains. Infants must learn - by a combination of sensitivity to distributional patterns and innate biases - that patterns of information are context-specific, as in the case of bilingualism. Our proposed experiments will extend our recent studies of human adults by determining (a) whether infants show the same pattern of learning biases (primacy effects) and context-sensitivity (to talker voice), (b) whether tamarin monkeys show these same biases and context effects, and (c) what the limits of context-specific statistical learning are in human adults and infants in both word segmentation and referential tasks.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Language development is one of the hallmarks of the human species, yet it is difficult to study because of the huge variation in early exposure to different amounts of linguistic input. The use of artificial languages that are acquired in the lab over a few hours provides a window on the mechanisms of language development. We will study language learning in the lab to gain a unique perspective on how the infants and adults learn the patterns of words in streams of speech and contrast this with performance in nonhuman primates. These studies will not only reveal a basic mechanism of language learning, but also establish benchmarks against which language delay can be compared. Moreover, understanding the mechanisms that lead to successful acquisition in normal infants and adults can help to identify loci of language disorders and design methods for remediating disorders.

"Optimal neural and behavioral markers for learning to learn during infancy     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human infants are confronted with a complex world that is filled with ambiguity. Not only are many different features and dimensions of information present in the environment, but these cues are often unrelated to any reinforcement or feedback. There are two solutions to learning in a complex and ambiguous environment: (a) innate constraints on the cues selected for processing (bottom-up), or (b) rapid learning-to-learn mechanisms that assess cues (top-down). Learned top-down mechanisms of information selection may be tuned more to specific task demands, and thus more useful for learning. Given how much infants have to learn over the first two years of life, it is not efficient to use mainly slow but precise (top-down) search methods. My hypothesis is that the developmental progression of learning how to learn requires using bottom-up information in a systematic way, while creating top-down buffers against bottom- up distraction. The experiments in the research plan will test this hypothesis, with each experiment evaluating an additional level of learning. Sophisticated behavioral techniques (i.e., both table- and head-mounted eye- tracking) and complementary state-of-the-art neuroimaging methods (i.e., functional near-infrared spectroscopy [fNIRS], measuring spatially-localized neural activation via non-invasive light probes on the scalp), as well as data mining tools applied to infant eye movement data, will examine how infants learn to learn from both computer displays and in naturalistic settings.  There are four specific aims in this research program: 1) to establish a new, robust measure of learning with both behavioral and neural measures, 2) to investigate how attentional deployment can optimally improve learning, 3) to apply the learning paradigm to the natural environment, and 4) to conduct microanalyses on and to develop computational models of infant eye movements. The training component focuses on learning to use two state-of-the-art methods in infancy research (a head-mounted eye-tracker and fNIRS), and learning to use innovative data mining tools to analyze patterns of infant eye movements to link looking behavior to cognitive abilities. This training program is essential for the applicant's career goal of identifying the optimal strategies for learning to learn that will lead to training regimens for populations with learning difficulties.  The findings will benefit researchers within the larger community of developmental science, as well as artificial intelligence, perceptual learning, education, animal learning, machine learning, and evolutionary psychology. This work will contribute to a foundational understanding of the dynamics of selective attention and learning in typical development, which in turn would inform populations with learning difficulties.          This multi-disciplinary research program will indicate signatures of optimal attentional deployment for efficient learning among distractions via converging evidence from behavioral and neuroimaging methods and data mining tools. This work will contribute to a foundational understanding of the dynamics of selective attention and learning in typical development, which in turn would inform populations with learning difficulties.

"The origin and significance of appearance-based stereotypes.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research program examines the origins, consequences, and significance of appearance-based stereotypes. One goal is to understand the cognitive mechanisms underlying the development of the universal preferences shown by infants, children, and adults for attractive faces. Why do even young infants prefer to look at attractive rather than unattractive faces and when do stereotypical expectations become attached to these visual preferences? By what processes do infants come to associate attractiveness with positive attributes and to associate unattractiveness with negative attributes? Given infants as young as 12 months of age display differential treatment of attractive and unattractive individuals they may have some primitive knowledge of appearance-based stereotypes much earlier than previously assumed. A second goal of the research is to form a better understanding of the consequences of appearance- based stereotypes. How do children behave toward others based on appearance? Do non-prototypical faces elicit negative affect from perceivers and, if so, how might this lead to stigmatization? What are the social, physical, and mental health risks associated with appearance-based stereotypes? Because the intent of this research is to provide a full understanding of the mechanisms underlying the development of preferences, attitudes, and stereotypes based on facial appearance, a multi- method, converging evidence approach, beginning in infancy is required. This project includes standard behavioral measures widely used in the developmental literature including infant looking behavior with physiological measures (EEG, ERP, & EMG). Physiological data (e.g. EEG recorded brain activity) will be correlated with a behavioral response and/or a measure of attitudes. The ultimate goal of this research will be to ameliorate the negative consequences associated with appearance-based stereotypes.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rudimentary stereotypes are the result of three innate information-processing mechanisms: Cognitive averaging, categorization, and statistical learning. We propose a multi-component model of development in which infants bootstrap simple preferences and associations into complex beliefs and attitudes.

"The Development and Neural Bases of Emotion Processing     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An important function of the brain is to scan incoming sensory information for the presence of biologically relevant features and process and act on this information. For humans, the most salient signals of emotion are often social in nature, such as expressions of fear or anger. The goal of the current competing renewal is to study the nature and neural architecture of emotion processing across the first three years of life. Five-, seven-, and twelve-month-old infants, as well as three-year-old typically developing children will serve as participants across 5 specific aims. Aim 1 seeks to examine the neural and cardiac correlates of the infant's ability to process emotion in both faces and non-face stimuli. Aim 2 examines a similar question, except that autonomic activity (skin conductance and pupil diameter) will be recorded in conjunction with functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS). Aim 3 seeks to elucidate the neural networks involved in emotion processing, and will do so by using state-of-the-art signal processing software to extract theta activity from the ongoing EEG. Aim 4 will focus on individual differences in emotion processing viewed through the lens of genetics; specifically, all infants serving as participants in Aims 1 and 2 will be genotyped, with most attention focused on 5 SNPs, with an additional 5 SNPs serving as a secondary aim. All SNPS have been shown to be relevant to emotion processing in both humans and non-human species. Finally, in Aim 5 we examine whether early biases in emotion processing (i.e., whether infants show greater visual or neural activity to one emotion vs. another; e.g., fear) predict (or are associated with) behavioral inhibition and anxiety. Although the current project focuses on typically developing children, this work has enormous implications for children and adults who suffer from deficits in social-emotional communication. First, this work seeks to explicate the ontogeny of facial emotion processing; an ability that likely provides a foundation upon which higher-level social communication builds. As a result, it may well be the case that errors in this ability that occur early in development can develop into more insidious deficits that occur later i development. Second, the approach adopted in this project is highly innovative, and can easily be extended to various clinical populations, such as toddlers with autism or children diagnosed with depression or bipolar illness.          Prior to the onset of language, infants and adults primarily communicate through non-verbal channels. Of particular importance is the infant's ability to decode facial expressions of emotion, an ability that is often compromised in children with autism or who has been maltreated and in adults with schizophrenia and bipolar illness. The goal of the current proposal is to examine the development and neural bases of emotion perception and recognition.

"CRCNS: Information Flow in the Brain During Language and Meaning Comprehension DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the past ten years a good deal has been learned from fMRI studies about the spatial patterns of neural activation used by the human brain to represent meanings of words and concepts. Much less is understood about the time evolution of this neural activity, including the temporally interrelated sub-processes the brain employs during the hundreds of milliseconds it takes to comprehend a single word, or the more complex processes it uses to construct and encode meaning of entire sentences as the words arrive one by one. We propose research to study, and to build computational models of, the detailed spatial and temporal neural activity observed during the comprehension of single words, phrases, sentences, and stories. This proposed research will specifically target the following questions: ""What information is encoded by neural activity where and when, and by which subprocesses in the brain, during the time it takes to comprehend a single word in isolation?"" ""What is the flow of information encoded when a newly sensed word first activates sensory cortex, then later results in neural activation encoding the word meaning?"" ""How does the brain integrate a newly encountered word in the context of earlier words in the sentence or phrase, to compose the meaning representation of the multi-word phrase or sentence?"" and ""How do semantic expectations and demands, together with syntactic sentence structure alter the processing of words, compared to processing the same words in isolation, or as an unstructured set such as {kick, Joe, ball}?"" To study these questions we will (1) devise novel experimental protocols to probe the flow of information encoded in neural signals during word and sentence processing, (2) collect new brain image data using both fMRI to achieve spatial resolution of a few millimeters, and MEG to achieve temporal resolution of a few milliseconds, (3) develop and apply novel machine learning approaches to build computational models that integrate and that predict this combined experimental data. Our goal is to develop an increasingly accurate computational model of how the brain comprehends words, phrases and sentences - a model that makes testable predictions about the neural activity observed in response to novel language stimuli. Intellectual Merit: This collaborative research brings together advanced machine learning algorithms with novel experimental protocols for MEG and fMRI brain imaging to advance our understanding of two fundamental open questions about the human brain: how does the brain represent meaning, and what neuro-cognitive processes construct that meaning piece-by-piece from perceived language stimuli? Broader Impacts: If successful, this research will impact a broad range of communities, including (1) cognitive neuroscience and computational linguistics, providing improved understanding of language processing in the brain, (2) machine learning, by driving the development of new methods for time series and latent variable analysis, integrating multiple data sets, and incorporating diverse  background knowledge as priors, (3) clinical studies of brain pathologies, especially those related to language processing, and informing treatment strategies for developmental and acquired language disorders (4) education of graduates, undergraduates and the general public, through dissemination of technical articles, teaching materials, and news about our work in the public press.

"PREDICTING CHILDHOOD OUTCOMES IN PRETERM INFANTS USING CEREBRAL CONNECTIVITY     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Premature birth remains a major public health issue due to its continuing high incidence combined with the frequency of developmental impairments among surviving infants. In order to improve developmental outcomes in very preterm infants (VPT, born prior to 32 weeks' gestation), accurate and early identification of the alterations in brain development that lead to subsequent developmental impairment is required. The candidate for this K02 Independent Scientist Award is a uniquely trained pediatric neurologist who seeks to define the relationship between cerebral connectivity during infancy and childhood developmental outcomes. This project will involve a valuable, well-characterized VPT cohort (N=128) which includes high-risk children selected due to the presence of brain injury during the neonatal period. These children have undergone clinical characterization and MRI during the neonatal period and developmental assessment at age 2 years. They will now undergo standardized assessment of developmental outcomes at age 5 years. The central hypotheses are that VPT children will display a persisting range of motor and language difficulties, and that affected VPT children will display abnormalities on imaging measures obtained during infancy that predict childhood performance, both at the group and individual level, in these distinct and critical developmental domains. We propose to investigate these postulates by: 1) comprehensively evaluating childhood motor and language performance; 2) defining the relationship between alterations in domain-specific neonatal functional and structural connectivity and childhood motor and language outcomes; and 3) investigating differences in brain- wide cerebral connectivity in impaired VPT children using machine learning, pattern classification approach. The result will be characterization of the alterations in cerebral connectivity that underlie developmental disabilities in VPT children. In addition, we seek to develop highly valuable neuroimaging biomarkers that predict future motor and language impairment, enabling the provision of targeted care tailored to the needs of each individual infant. Finally, these tools will contribute to future, large-scale trials evaluating interventions designed to protect the developing brain. In pursuit of this goal, a focused career development program will complement the candidate's background in engineering and magnetic resonance methodology with training in developmental assessments and innovative image analysis approaches using applied mathematics, providing skills necessary to perform accurate longitudinal clinical research studies and develop individual prediction models. The supported activities will facilitate an NIH R-mechanism application centered upon innovative investigation of individual prediction models for developmental trajectories in VPT children during school-age, including repeat neuroimaging assessments during childhood. The culmination of these efforts will be transformative investigation that fosters improved outcomes for this high-risk population.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Despite continued high rates of disabilities in infants born prematurely, methods for accurately identifying those that would benefit most from specific therapies or protective interventions remain limited. This study is designed to improve our understanding of the alterations in brain function and structure that produce these deficits by using novel approaches to examine how magnetic resonance imaging data predicts early childhood outcomes.

For humans, the most salient signals of emotion are often social in nature, such as expressions of fear or anger. The goal of the current competing renewal is to study the nature and neural architecture of emotion processing across the first three years of life. Five-, seven-, and twelve-month-old infants, as well as three-year-old typically developing children will serve as participants across 5 specific aims. Aim 1 seeks to examine the neural and cardiac correlates of the infant's ability to process emotion in both faces and non-face stimuli. Aim 2 examines a similar question, except that autonomic activity (skin conductance and pupil diameter) will be recorded in conjunction with functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS). Aim 3 seeks to elucidate the neural networks involved in emotion processing, and will do so by using state-of-the-art signal processing software to extract theta activity from the ongoing EEG. Aim 4 will focus on individual differences in emotion processing viewed through the lens of genetics; specifically, all infants serving as participants in Aims 1 and 2 will be genotyped, with most attention focused on 5 SNPs, with an additional 5 SNPs serving as a secondary aim. All SNPS have been shown to be relevant to emotion processing in both humans and non-human species. Finally, in Aim 5 we examine whether early biases in emotion processing (i.e., whether infants show greater visual or neural activity to one emotion vs. another; e.g., fear) predict (or are associated with) behavioral inhibition and anxiety. Although the current project focuses on typically developing children, this work has enormous implications for children and adults who suffer from deficits in social-emotional communication. First, this work seeks to explicate the ontogeny of facial emotion processing; an ability that likely provides a foundation upon which higher-level social communication builds. As a result, it may well be the case that errors in this ability that occur early in development can develop into more insidious deficits that occur later i development. Second, the approach adopted in this project is highly innovative, and can easily be extended to various clinical populations, such as toddlers with autism or children diagnosed with depression or bipolar illness.          Prior to the onset of language, infants and adults primarily communicate through non-verbal channels. Of particular importance is the infant's ability to decode facial expressions of emotion, an ability that is often compromised in children with autism or who has been maltreated and in adults with schizophrenia and bipolar illness. The goal of the current proposal is to examine the development and neural bases of emotion perception and recognition.

"Optimal neural and behavioral markers for learning to learn during infancy     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human infants are confronted with a complex world that is filled with ambiguity. Not only are many different features and dimensions of information present in the environment, but these cues are often unrelated to any reinforcement or feedback. There are two solutions to learning in a complex and ambiguous environment: (a) innate constraints on the cues selected for processing (bottom-up), or (b) rapid learning-to-learn mechanisms that assess cues (top-down). Learned top-down mechanisms of information selection may be tuned more to specific task demands, and thus more useful for learning. Given how much infants have to learn over the first two years of life, it is not efficient to use mainly slow but precise (top-down) search methods. My hypothesis is that the developmental progression of learning how to learn requires using bottom-up information in a systematic way, while creating top-down buffers against bottom- up distraction. The experiments in the research plan will test this hypothesis, with each experiment evaluating an additional level of learning. Sophisticated behavioral techniques (i.e., both table- and head-mounted eye- tracking) and complementary state-of-the-art neuroimaging methods (i.e., functional near-infrared spectroscopy [fNIRS], measuring spatially-localized neural activation via non-invasive light probes on the scalp), as well as data mining tools applied to infant eye movement data, will examine how infants learn to learn from both computer displays and in naturalistic settings.  There are four specific aims in this research program: 1) to establish a new, robust measure of learning with both behavioral and neural measures, 2) to investigate how attentional deployment can optimally improve learning, 3) to apply the learning paradigm to the natural environment, and 4) to conduct microanalyses on and to develop computational models of infant eye movements. The training component focuses on learning to use two state-of-the-art methods in infancy research (a head-mounted eye-tracker and fNIRS), and learning to use innovative data mining tools to analyze patterns of infant eye movements to link looking behavior to cognitive abilities. This training program is essential for the applicant's career goal of identifying the optimal strategies for learning to learn that will lead to training regimens for populations with learning difficulties.  The findings will benefit researchers within the larger community of developmental science, as well as artificial intelligence, perceptual learning, education, animal learning, machine learning, and evolutionary psychology. This work will contribute to a foundational understanding of the dynamics of selective attention and learning in typical development, which in turn would inform populations with learning difficulties.          This multi-disciplinary research program will indicate signatures of optimal attentional deployment for efficient learning among distractions via converging evidence from behavioral and neuroimaging methods and data mining tools. This work will contribute to a foundational understanding of the dynamics of selective attention and learning in typical development, which in turn would inform populations with learning difficulties.

"The relationship of fecal microbiomes and nutritional status in CF ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intestinal tract disease is responsible for a substantial amount of the morbidity and mortality among people with the genetic disease cystic fibrosis (CF). The manifestations of CF intestinal disease frequently occur during infancy and result from pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (PI), resulting in profound nutrient malabsorption and malnutrition, and consequently in growth failure and intestinal obstruction. Despite aggressive, early nutritional intervention with pancreatic enzyme replacement and other therapies, early growth failure remains common among infants with CF, suggesting that characteristics other than PI contribute to growth and nutritional failure in infants with CF. The identification of thes growth and nutritional determinants in children with CF therefore remains a key research goal in CF care. Recently, a clue to a potentially critical contributor to nutrient and energy uptake in children has emerged from the study of the microbes present in the gastrointestinal tract- the gut microbiota. Research has identified a complex relationship between gut microbiota, nutritional intake, nutrient absorption, and other health measures. GI tract microbes are known to contribute significantly to human nutrient metabolism and energy harvest, and they are altered in many disease states. Therefore, infant GI tract microbes may represent important determinants of CF nutritional outcomes, which in turn can significantly impact severity of lung disease and overall longevity. We recently showed that infants and children with CF had GI microbiota that differ markedly from those of children without CF, and that this dysbiosis correlated with severity of GI dysfunction. However, the relationships between CF GI microbiota with growth and other clinically important outcomes have not been studied. We hypothesize that the intestinal microbiomes among children with CF correlate with severity of malabsorption, intestinal inflammation, gastrointestinal signs and symptoms, vitamin and mineral deficiency, and nutritional status. To test these hypotheses, this ancillary study will define the fecal microbiomes of 250 infants with CF being enrolled in an ongoing multicenter study of infant nutrition (the Baby Observational NUtrition Study (BONUS), funded by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and the National Institutes of Health) using ultra high-throughput, culture-independent sequencing methods. With these resources, we will (1) define the fecal microbiomes, composed of the microbiota (the species of microbes present) and metagenomes (the microbial genes present, which reflects the metabolic capacity of the microbiota) of at least four stool samples per subject over the first year of life, and (2) determine the relationship of fecal microbiomes, and their evolution over the year of study, with nutritional and clinical parameters (including weight, height, body mass index, growth rate of each of these parameters among subjects, serum vitamin levels, fecal nutrient and metabolite content, GI symptoms, and measures of inflammation). We will use massively parallel next- generation DNA sequencing methods, combined with advanced bioinformatic analytical methods, with which we have extensive experience. Our goal is to define the role of the infant CF GI microbiome in growth and nutrition, with the hope of identifying interventions that will improve early growth, and thus long-term outcomes, in CF.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent scientific evidence suggests that the microbes that live in the gastrointestinal tracts of humans and other animals play key roles in the metabolism of nutrients, harvest of energy for the host, and the uptake of vitamins. Therefore, these microbes may be important contributors to diseases in which nutrients are poorly absorbed, the gastrointestinal tract is diseased, and/or the host grows poorly. The aim of this project is to determine the role of gastrointestinal microbes in the relentless and difficult-to-treat growth failure in children with the genetic disease cystic fibrosis, with the hope of both identifying interventions that will lead to better nutritional outcomes in these and in other children with poo early growth.            ",The relationship of fecal microbiomes and nutritional status in CF,8815576,R01DK095869,"['absorption ', ' Animals ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Bacteria ', ' Bacteroides ', ' Breastfeeding ', ' Breast Feeding ', ' Carbohydrates ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' Mucoviscidosis ', ' Cystic Fibrosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' E coli ', ' Escherichia coli ', ' Evolution ', ' Fats ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Fatty Acids ', ' Short-Chain Fatty Acids ', ' Volatile Fatty Acids ', ' stool ', ' Feces ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' gastrointestinal disorder ', ' Gastrointestinal Diseases and Manifestations ', ' Gastrointestinal Diseases ', ' digestive canal ', ' alimentary tract ', ' Gastrointestinal Tract ', ' GI Tract ', ' Digestive Tract ', ' Alimentary Canal ', ' Gastrointestinal tract structure ', ' Genes ', ' Bacterial Genes ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' hereditary disorder ', ' genetic disorder ', ' Molecular Disease ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' Genetic Condition ', ' Hereditary Disease ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' Immune system ', ' Infant ', ' infant nutrition ', ' Inflammation ', ' intestine disorder ', ' Intestinal Disorder ', ' Intestinal Diseases ', ' intestine obstruction ', ' Bowel Obstruction ', ' Intestinal Obstruction ', ' bowel ', ' Intestinal ', ' Intestines ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Lipids ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Lung ', ' lung disorder ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Lung diseases ', ' malabsorption ', ' intestinal malabsorption ', ' gastrointestinal absorption disorder ', ' Malabsorption Syndromes ', ' Methods ', ' Minerals ', ' Study models ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Statistical learning of multiple patterns in infants, adults, and monkeys    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the present grant application is to understand how a naive learner collects distributional information from the environment and makes an implicit decision that the corpus of input contains either a single structure or multiple structures. Mature learners are incredibly facile at interpreting information in a context-specific manner, thereby partitioning the input into two or more sub-structures. We will investigate this question of context-specific statistical learning by studying two types of naove learners - human infants and tamarin monkeys - as well as mature adults. The specific objective of the proposed research is to determine whether and how infants learn that there are multiple patterns of information embedded in streams of speech, or that there are multiple words that refer to the same object, and to determine whether context-specific statistical learning has species-specific biases. Two types of experimental designs will be used to study context-specific statistical learning. The first uses a single change in the underlying structure. A variety of contextual cues will be introduced to signal that the underlying structure has undergone a change, and the dependent measure is whether the learner has acquired the first, the second, both the first and the second, or neither structures. The second design uses two alternating structures that are signaled by a variety of stimulus cues to partition the two underlying structures. It is important to note that in both of these designs, if the learner aggregates the structural information across the entire corpus, rather than partitioning the corpus into two subsets, no learning is possible. Thus, these designs test the ability of the learner to extract the contextual cues that partition the input into subsets. The implications of the proposed studies are fundamental to any theory of learning, but particularly to the kind of implicit (passive exposure) statistical learning that is thought to characterize much of early human development in many domains. Infants must learn - by a combination of sensitivity to distributional patterns and innate biases - that patterns of information are context-specific, as in the case of bilingualism. Our proposed experiments will extend our recent studies of human adults by determining (a) whether infants show the same pattern of learning biases (primacy effects) and context-sensitivity (to talker voice), (b) whether tamarin monkeys show these same biases and context effects, and (c) what the limits of context-specific statistical learning are in human adults and infants in both word segmentation and referential tasks.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Language development is one of the hallmarks of the human species, yet it is difficult to study because of the huge variation in early exposure to different amounts of linguistic input. The use of artificial languages that are acquired in the lab over a few hours provides a window on the mechanisms of language development. We will study language learning in the lab to gain a unique perspective on how the infants and adults learn the patterns of words in streams of speech and contrast this with performance in nonhuman primates. These studies will not only reveal a basic mechanism of language learning, but also establish benchmarks against which language delay can be compared. Moreover, understanding the mechanisms that lead to successful acquisition in normal infants and adults can help to identify loci of language disorders and design methods for remediating disorders.

"The origin and significance of appearance-based stereotypes.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research program examines the origins, consequences, and significance of appearance-based stereotypes. One goal is to understand the cognitive mechanisms underlying the development of the universal preferences shown by infants, children, and adults for attractive faces. Why do even young infants prefer to look at attractive rather than unattractive faces and when do stereotypical expectations become attached to these visual preferences? By what processes do infants come to associate attractiveness with positive attributes and to associate unattractiveness with negative attributes? Given infants as young as 12 months of age display differential treatment of attractive and unattractive individuals they may have some primitive knowledge of appearance-based stereotypes much earlier than previously assumed. A second goal of the research is to form a better understanding of the consequences of appearance- based stereotypes. How do children behave toward others based on appearance? Do non-prototypical faces elicit negative affect from perceivers and, if so, how might this lead to stigmatization? What are the social, physical, and mental health risks associated with appearance-based stereotypes? Because the intent of this research is to provide a full understanding of the mechanisms underlying the development of preferences, attitudes, and stereotypes based on facial appearance, a multi- method, converging evidence approach, beginning in infancy is required. This project includes standard behavioral measures widely used in the developmental literature including infant looking behavior with physiological measures (EEG, ERP, & EMG). Physiological data (e.g. EEG recorded brain activity) will be correlated with a behavioral response and/or a measure of attitudes. The ultimate goal of this research will be to ameliorate the negative consequences associated with appearance-based stereotypes.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rudimentary stereotypes are the result of three innate information-processing mechanisms: Cognitive averaging, categorization, and statistical learning. We propose a multi-component model of development in which infants bootstrap simple preferences and associations into complex beliefs and attitudes.

We propose research to study, and to build computational models of, the detailed spatial and temporal neural activity observed during the comprehension of single words, phrases, sentences, and stories. This proposed research will specifically target the following questions: ""What information is encoded by neural activity where and when, and by which subprocesses in the brain, during the time it takes to comprehend a single word in isolation?"" ""What is the flow of information encoded when a newly sensed word first activates sensory cortex, then later results in neural activation encoding the word meaning?""

"Infant statistical learning: Resilience, longevity, and specificity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Typically developing infants acquire language at a remarkable rate despite numerous perceptual and cognitive challenges. Infants may begin to learn language by tracking regularities in their environment. Specifically, research suggests that infants possess powerful computational mechanisms that may support the segmentation of words from fluent speech and facilitate word learning. The problem is that there is little research on the extent to which statistical regularities support early language acquisition under the challenging learning conditions often faced by young infants. The objective of the proposed research is to advance integrative and comprehensive theories of infant language acquisition by assessing how statistical learning supports (1) speech segmentation and word learning in background noise, (2) infants' ability to encode lexical representations in long-term memory, and (3) infants' abilities to represent newly segmented words with the appropriate level and type of detail to facilitate subsequent language learning. Three Aims will be addressed across nine experiments designed to test how statistical regularities found in natural language input support resilience, longevity, and representational specificity within a developmental framework. Infants will be familiarized with a short natural Italian language corpus and then tested on their ability o either discriminate words that have strong versus weak internal co-occurrence patterns (8- and 11-month-olds), or associate those words with novel objects (17-month-olds). Experiments are designed to tests how infants cope with simultaneous learning challenges. We will test the predictions that strong syllable co-occurrence patterns will bolster (1) speech segmentation and word learning in noise and (2) long-term memory for newly extracted words, and (3) that infants' word form representations will become more robust and specific. Results from the proposed project will advance our understanding of the learning mechanisms underlying normative language development. Individuals who are, for a variety of sensory, neurological, or developmental reasons, less adept at tracking and representing statistical regularities when faced with real-world learning challenges may be at greater risk for atypical language development. Results from the proposed research will be used to help generate and test hypotheses about the causal mechanisms for specific language delays in atypical populations, such as for infants with hearing loss or infants who, for various reasons, receive sub-optimal language input during critical developmental periods.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed set of studies explores potential mechanisms underlying positive language outcomes in typically developing infants. Being at risk for atypical language development poses a major health concern. The results of the project will help us generate testable hypotheses about the causal mechanisms for specific language delays in atypical populations, such as for infants with hearing loss or infants who, for various reasons, receive sub-optimal language input during critical developmental periods, and will begin to address NIH's need for evidence-based research to guide clinical practice.            ","Infant statistical learning: Resilience, longevity, and specificity",8984582,R01HD083312,"['Affect ', ' Felis sylvestris catus ', ' Felis domesticus ', ' Felis domestica ', ' Feline Species ', ' Domestic Cats ', ' Cats Mammals ', ' Cats ', ' Felis catus ', ' Bats ', ' Chiroptera ', ' critical developmental period ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Infant ', ' Language ', ' Language Delays ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Language Development ', ' Learning ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Memory ', ' Noise ', ' Phonetics ', ' Play ', ' Probability ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' sound ', ' Specificity ', ' Speech ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Gender ', ' Label ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Individual ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' long term memory ', ' Hour ', ' Complex ', ' Stream ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' theories ', ' Hypoacusis ', ' Hypoacuses ', ' Hearing Loss ', ' hearing impairment ', ' Address ', ' Cognitive ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Output ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' clinical applicability ', ' clinical application ', ' lexical ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' clinical practice ', ' natural language ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE KNOXVILLE,R01,2015,241243,TN-02,0.006177857432726742
"The relationship of fecal microbiomes and nutritional status in CF ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intestinal tract disease is responsible for a substantial amount of the morbidity and mortality among people with the genetic disease cystic fibrosis (CF). The manifestations of CF intestinal disease frequently occur during infancy and result from pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (PI), resulting in profound nutrient malabsorption and malnutrition, and consequently in growth failure and intestinal obstruction. Despite aggressive, early nutritional intervention with pancreatic enzyme replacement and other therapies, early growth failure remains common among infants with CF, suggesting that characteristics other than PI contribute to growth and nutritional failure in infants with CF. The identification of thes growth and nutritional determinants in children with CF therefore remains a key research goal in CF care. Recently, a clue to a potentially critical contributor to nutrient and energy uptake in children has emerged from the study of the microbes present in the gastrointestinal tract- the gut microbiota. Research has identified a complex relationship between gut microbiota, nutritional intake, nutrient absorption, and other health measures. GI tract microbes are known to contribute significantly to human nutrient metabolism and energy harvest, and they are altered in many disease states. Therefore, infant GI tract microbes may represent important determinants of CF nutritional outcomes, which in turn can significantly impact severity of lung disease and overall longevity. We recently showed that infants and children with CF had GI microbiota that differ markedly from those of children without CF, and that this dysbiosis correlated with severity of GI dysfunction. However, the relationships between CF GI microbiota with growth and other clinically important outcomes have not been studied. We hypothesize that the intestinal microbiomes among children with CF correlate with severity of malabsorption, intestinal inflammation, gastrointestinal signs and symptoms, vitamin and mineral deficiency, and nutritional status. To test these hypotheses, this ancillary study will define the fecal microbiomes of 250 infants with CF being enrolled in an ongoing multicenter study of infant nutrition (the Baby Observational NUtrition Study (BONUS), funded by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and the National Institutes of Health) using ultra high-throughput, culture-independent sequencing methods. With these resources, we will (1) define the fecal microbiomes, composed of the microbiota (the species of microbes present) and metagenomes (the microbial genes present, which reflects the metabolic capacity of the microbiota) of at least four stool samples per subject over the first year of life, and (2) determine the relationship of fecal microbiomes, and their evolution over the year of study, with nutritional and clinical parameters (including weight, height, body mass index, growth rate of each of these parameters among subjects, serum vitamin levels, fecal nutrient and metabolite content, GI symptoms, and measures of inflammation). We will use massively parallel next- generation DNA sequencing methods, combined with advanced bioinformatic analytical methods, with which we have extensive experience. Our goal is to define the role of the infant CF GI microbiome in growth and nutrition, with the hope of identifying interventions that will improve early growth, and thus long-term outcomes, in CF. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent scientific evidence suggests that the microbes that live in the gastrointestinal tracts of humans and other animals play key roles in the metabolism of nutrients, harvest of energy for the host, and the uptake of vitamins. Therefore, these microbes may be important contributors to diseases in which nutrients are poorly absorbed, the gastrointestinal tract is diseased, and/or the host grows poorly. The aim of this project is to determine the role of gastrointestinal microbes in the relentless and difficult-to-treat growth failure in children with the genetic disease cystic fibrosis, with the hope of both identifying interventions that will lead to better nutritional outcomes in these and in other children with poo early growth.",The relationship of fecal microbiomes and nutritional status in CF,8929222,R01DK095869,"['absorption ', ' Animals ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Bacteria ', ' Bacteroides ', ' Breastfeeding ', ' Breast Feeding ', ' Carbohydrates ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' Mucoviscidosis ', ' Cystic Fibrosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' E coli ', ' Escherichia coli ', ' Evolution ', ' Fats ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Fatty Acids ', ' Short-Chain Fatty Acids ', ' Volatile Fatty Acids ', ' stool ', ' Feces ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' gastrointestinal disorder ', ' Gastrointestinal Diseases and Manifestations ', ' Gastrointestinal Diseases ', ' Gastrointestinal tract structure ', ' digestive canal ', ' alimentary tract ', ' Gastrointestinal Tract ', ' GI Tract ', ' Digestive Tract ', ' Alimentary Canal ', ' Genes ', ' Bacterial Genes ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' hereditary disorder ', ' genetic disorder ', ' Molecular Disease ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' Genetic Condition ', ' Hereditary Disease ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' Immune system ', ' Infant ', ' infant nutrition ', ' Inflammation ', ' intestine disorder ', ' Intestinal Disorder ', ' Intestinal Diseases ', ' intestine obstruction ', ' Bowel Obstruction ', ' Intestinal Obstruction ', ' bowel ', ' Intestinal ', ' Intestines ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Lipids ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Lung ', ' lung disorder ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Lung diseases ', ' malabsorption ', ' intestinal malabsorption ', ' gastrointestinal absorption disorder ', ' Malabsorption Syndromes ', ' Methods ', ' Minerals ', ' Study models ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"The Development and Neural Bases of Emotion Processing DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An important function of the brain is to scan incoming sensory information for the presence of biologically relevant features and process and act on this information. For humans, the most salient signals of emotion are often social in nature, such as expressions of fear or anger. The goal of the current competing renewal is to study the nature and neural architecture of emotion processing across the first three years of life. Five-, seven-, and twelve-month-old infants, as well as three-year-old typically developing children will serve as participants across 5 specific aims. Aim 1 seeks to examine the neural and cardiac correlates of the infant's ability to process emotion in both faces and non-face stimuli. Aim 2 examines a similar question, except that autonomic activity (skin conductance and pupil diameter) will be recorded in conjunction with functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS). Aim 3 seeks to elucidate the neural networks involved in emotion processing, and will do so by using state-of-the-art signal processing software to extract theta activity from the ongoing EEG. Aim 4 will focus on individual differences in emotion processing viewed through the lens of genetics; specifically, all infants serving as participants in Aims 1 and 2 will be genotyped, with most attention focused on 5 SNPs, with an additional 5 SNPs serving as a secondary aim. All SNPS have been shown to be relevant to emotion processing in both humans and non-human species. Finally, in Aim 5 we examine whether early biases in emotion processing (i.e., whether infants show greater visual or neural activity to one emotion vs. another; e.g., fear) predict (or are associated with) behavioral inhibition and anxiety. Although the current project focuses on typically developing children, this work has enormous implications for children and adults who suffer from deficits in social-emotional communication. First, this work seeks to explicate the ontogeny of facial emotion processing; an ability that likely provides a foundation upon which higher-level social communication builds. As a result, it may well be the case that errors in this ability that occur early in development can develop into more insidious deficits that occur later i development. Second, the approach adopted in this project is highly innovative, and can easily be extended to various clinical populations, such as toddlers with autism or children diagnosed with depression or bipolar illness. Prior to the onset of language, infants and adults primarily communicate through non-verbal channels. Of particular importance is the infant's ability to decode facial expressions of emotion, an ability that is often compromised in children with autism or who has been maltreated and in adults with schizophrenia and bipolar illness. The goal of the current proposal is to examine the development and neural bases of emotion perception and recognition.",The Development and Neural Bases of Emotion Processing,8816129,R01MH078829,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' angry ', ' angers ', ' Anger ', ' Anxiety ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Architecture ', ' Arousal ', ' Attention ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' Infantile Autism ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Behavior ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Child Behavior ', ' Communication ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' EEG ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' Emotions ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' face expression ', ' Facial Expression ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' Foundations ', ' skin conductance ', ' Skin Electric Conductance ', ' Psychogalvanic Reflex ', ' Electrodermal Response ', ' Galvanic Skin Response ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Infant ', ' Perception ', ' polymorphism ', ' Polymorphism (Genetics) ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' Pupil ', ' Scalp ', ' Scalp structure ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' sociobehavior ', ' Social Behavior ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Testing ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Variation (Genetics) ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' BDNF ', ' Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Stimulus ', ' Visual ', ' Metabolic ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Near-Infrared Spectrometry ', ' NIR Spectroscopy ', ' Near-Infrared Spectroscopy ', ' Life ', ' Adopted ', ' Scanning ', ' Sensory ', ' expression of emotion ', ' emotional expression ', ' showing emotion ', ' Inferior ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' neural network ', ' Biological Neural Networks ', ' early childhood ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' Animal Model ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Neural Development ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Participant ', ' Toddler ', ' social ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Emotional ', ' response ', ' one year old ', ' age 1 year ', ' 1 year old ', ' Diameter ', ' Caliber ', ' AVPR1A ', ' AVPR1 ', ' AVPR1A gene ', ' Dopamine Receptor D4 Gene ', ' DRD4 ', ' D4DR Gene ', ' D(4) Dopamine Receptor Gene ', ' D(2C) Dopamine Receptor Gene ', ' DRD4 gene ', ' RGS2 ', ' G0S8 ', ' RGS2 gene ', ' Age-Months ', ' Data ', ' Process ', ' Cardiac ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral inhibition ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' Individual Differences ', ' social communication ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' three year old ', ' age 3 years ', ' 3 year old ', ' Affective ', ' language onset ', ' stimulus processing ', ' lenses ', ' lens ', ' signal processing ', ' ']",NIMH,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2015,764840,MA-07,0.09339693954007046

"PREDICTING CHILDHOOD OUTCOMES IN PRETERM INFANTS USING CEREBRAL CONNECTIVITY DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Premature birth remains a major public health issue due to its continuing high incidence combined with the frequency of developmental impairments among surviving infants. In order to improve developmental outcomes in very preterm infants (VPT, born prior to 32 weeks' gestation), accurate and early identification of the alterations in brain development that lead to subsequent developmental impairment is required. The candidate for this K02 Independent Scientist Award is a uniquely trained pediatric neurologist who seeks to define the relationship between cerebral connectivity during infancy and childhood developmental outcomes. This project will involve a valuable, well-characterized VPT cohort (N=128) which includes high-risk children selected due to the presence of brain injury during the neonatal period. These children have undergone clinical characterization and MRI during the neonatal period and developmental assessment at age 2 years. They will now undergo standardized assessment of developmental outcomes at age 5 years. The central hypotheses are that VPT children will display a persisting range of motor and language difficulties, and that affected VPT children will display abnormalities on imaging measures obtained during infancy that predict childhood performance, both at the group and individual level, in these distinct and critical developmental domains. We propose to investigate these postulates by: 1) comprehensively evaluating childhood motor and language performance; 2) defining the relationship between alterations in domain-specific neonatal functional and structural connectivity and childhood motor and language outcomes; and 3) investigating differences in brain- wide cerebral connectivity in impaired VPT children using machine learning, pattern classification approach. The result will be characterization of the alterations in cerebral connectivity that underlie developmental disabilities in VPT children. In addition, we seek to develop highly valuable neuroimaging biomarkers that predict future motor and language impairment, enabling the provision of targeted care tailored to the needs of each individual infant. Finally, these tools will contribute to future, large-scale trials evaluating interventions designed to protect the developing brain. In pursuit of this goal, a focused career development program will complement the candidate's background in engineering and magnetic resonance methodology with training in developmental assessments and innovative image analysis approaches using applied mathematics, providing skills necessary to perform accurate longitudinal clinical research studies and develop individual prediction models. The supported activities will facilitate an NIH R-mechanism application centered upon innovative investigation of individual prediction models for developmental trajectories in VPT children during school-age, including repeat neuroimaging assessments during childhood. The culmination of these efforts will be transformative investigation that fosters improved outcomes for this high-risk population. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Despite continued high rates of disabilities in infants born prematurely, methods for accurately identifying those that would benefit most from specific therapies or protective interventions remain limited. This study is designed to improve our understanding of the alterations in brain function and structure that produce these deficits by using novel approaches to examine how magnetic resonance imaging data predicts early childhood outcomes. The goal is to identify imaging measures which identify preterm infants at risk for particular deficits, thereby allowing institution of timely therapies specific to each chid's needs and enabling larger research trials evaluating interventions designed to improve developmental outcomes in this vulnerable group.",PREDICTING CHILDHOOD OUTCOMES IN PRETERM INFANTS USING CEREBRAL CONNECTIVITY,8934210,K02NS089852,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' Award ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Child Development Disorders ', ' Developmental Disabilities ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Diffusion ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Evolution ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Incidence ', ' Infant ', ' preterm neonate ', ' preterm infant human ', ' preterm infant ', ' preterm baby ', ' premature infant human ', ' premature baby ', ' Premature Infant ', ' Language ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Language Development ', ' language deficit ', ' Language disability ', ' Language Disorders ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Maps ', ' Math ', ' Mathematics ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurobiology ', ' Patients ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Measures ', ' Caring ', ' preterm delivery ', ' premature delivery ', ' premature childbirth ', ' Preterm Birth ', ' Premature Birth ', ' improved ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' infantile ', ' infancy ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Neurologist ', ' cerebral ', ' Cerebrum ', ' Fostering ', ' school age ', ' School-Age Population ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' brain lesion (from injury) ', ' brain damage ', ' Acquired brain injury ', ' Brain Injuries ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Performance ', ' early childhood ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Modality ', ' motor deficit ', ' Early identification ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Magnetic Resonance ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' K02 Award ', ' Independent Scientist Award ', ' Motor ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' white matter injury ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' Neonatal ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' two year old ', ' age 2 years ', ' 2 year old ', ' five year old ', ' age 5 years ', ' 5 year old ', ' Impairment ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' high risk ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' ']",NINDS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K02,2015,191131,MO-01,0.05694045010863816
"Statistical learning of multiple patterns in infants, adults, and monkeys DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the present grant application is to understand how a naive learner collects distributional information from the environment and makes an implicit decision that the corpus of input contains either a single structure or multiple structures. Mature learners are incredibly facile at interpreting information in a context-specific manner, thereby partitioning the input into two or more sub-structures. We will investigate this question of context-specific statistical learning by studying two types of naove learners - human infants and tamarin monkeys - as well as mature adults. The specific objective of the proposed research is to determine whether and how infants learn that there are multiple patterns of information embedded in streams of speech, or that there are multiple words that refer to the same object, and to determine whether context-specific statistical learning has species-specific biases. Two types of experimental designs will be used to study context-specific statistical learning. The first uses a single change in the underlying structure. A variety of contextual cues will be introduced to signal that the underlying structure has undergone a change, and the dependent measure is whether the learner has acquired the first, the second, both the first and the second, or neither structures. The second design uses two alternating structures that are signaled by a variety of stimulus cues to partition the two underlying structures. It is important to note that in both of these designs, if the learner aggregates the structural information across the entire corpus, rather than partitioning the corpus into two subsets, no learning is possible. Thus, these designs test the ability of the learner to extract the contextual cues that partition the input into subsets. The implications of the proposed studies are fundamental to any theory of learning, but particularly to the kind of implicit (passive exposure) statistical learning that is thought to characterize much of early human development in many domains. Infants must learn - by a combination of sensitivity to distributional patterns and innate biases - that patterns of information are context-specific, as in the case of bilingualism. Our proposed experiments will extend our recent studies of human adults by determining (a) whether infants show the same pattern of learning biases (primacy effects) and context-sensitivity (to talker voice), (b) whether tamarin monkeys show these same biases and context effects, and (c) what the limits of context-specific statistical learning are in human adults and infants in both word segmentation and referential tasks. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Language development is one of the hallmarks of the human species, yet it is difficult to study because of the huge variation in early exposure to different amounts of linguistic input. The use of artificial languages that are acquired in the lab over a few hours provides a window on the mechanisms of language development. We will study language learning in the lab to gain a unique perspective on how the infants and adults learn the patterns of words in streams of speech and contrast this with performance in nonhuman primates. These studies will not only reveal a basic mechanism of language learning, but also establish benchmarks against which language delay can be compared. Moreover, understanding the mechanisms that lead to successful acquisition in normal infants and adults can help to identify loci of language disorders and design methods for remediating disorders.","Statistical learning of multiple patterns in infants, adults, and monkeys",8851635,R01HD067250,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Cues ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Economics ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye ', ' Football ', ' Manufactured football ', ' Goals ', ' Head ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Human Development ', ' Infant ', ' Judgment ', ' Language ', ' Language Delays ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Language Development ', ' language deficit ', ' Language disability ', ' Language Disorders ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Linguistic ', ' Linguistics ', ' Methods ', ' Monkeys ', ' Parents ', ' Phonetics ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Tamarins ', ' Saguinus ', ' Semantics ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Soccer ', ' Speech ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Voice ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' auditory stimulus ', ' Procedures ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Stimulus ', ' non-human primate ', ' nonhuman primate ', ' Recovery ', ' bilingualism ', ' Exposure to ', ' Rivers ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Head Movements ', ' Hour ', ' Stream ', ' Pattern ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' preference ', ' American ', ' British ', ' Performance ', ' phonological ', ' phonology ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Data ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Sum ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', "" man's "", ' man ', ' lexical ', ' ']",NICHD,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R01,2015,208800,PA-12,0.00762916913331422
"The Development and neural Bases of Emotion Processing DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An important function of the brain is to scan incoming sensory information for the presence of biologically relevant features and process and act on this information. For humans, the most salient signals of emotion are often social in nature, such as expressions of fear or anger. The goal of the current competing renewal is to study the nature and neural architecture of emotion processing across the first three years of life. Five-, seven-, and twelve-month-old infants, as well as three-year-old typically developing children will serve as participants across 5 specific aims. Aim 1 seeks to examine the neural and cardiac correlates of the infant's ability to process emotion in both faces and non-face stimuli. Aim 2 examines a similar question, except that autonomic activity (skin conductance and pupil diameter) will be recorded in conjunction with functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS). Aim 3 seeks to elucidate the neural networks involved in emotion processing, and will do so by using state-of-the-art signal processing software to extract theta activity from the ongoing EEG. Aim 4 will focus on individual differences in emotion processing viewed through the lens of genetics; specifically, all infants serving as participants in Aims 1 and 2 will be genotyped, with most attention focused on 5 SNPs, with an additional 5 SNPs serving as a secondary aim. All SNPS have been shown to be relevant to emotion processing in both humans and non-human species. Finally, in Aim 5 we examine whether early biases in emotion processing (i.e., whether infants show greater visual or neural activity to one emotion vs. another; e.g., fear) predict (or are associated with) behavioral inhibition and anxiety. Although the current project focuses on typically developing children, this work has enormous implications for children and adults who suffer from deficits in social-emotional communication. First, this work seeks to explicate the ontogeny of facial emotion processing; an ability that likely provides a foundation upon which higher-level social communication builds. As a result, it may well be the case that errors in this ability that occur early in development can develop into more insidious deficits that occur later i development. Second, the approach adopted in this project is highly innovative, and can easily be extended to various clinical populations, such as toddlers with autism or children diagnosed with depression or bipolar illness. Prior to the onset of language, infants and adults primarily communicate through non-verbal channels. Of particular importance is the infant's ability to decode facial expressions of emotion, an ability that is often compromised in children with autism or who has been maltreated and in adults with schizophrenia and bipolar illness.

"The relationship of fecal microbiomes and nutritional status in CF ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intestinal tract disease is responsible for a substantial amount of the morbidity and mortality among people with the genetic disease cystic fibrosis (CF). The manifestations of CF intestinal disease frequently occur during infancy and result from pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (PI), resulting in profound nutrient malabsorption and malnutrition, and consequently in growth failure and intestinal obstruction. Despite aggressive, early nutritional intervention with pancreatic enzyme replacement and other therapies, early growth failure remains common among infants with CF, suggesting that characteristics other than PI contribute to growth and nutritional failure in infants with CF. The identification of thes growth and nutritional determinants in children with CF therefore remains a key research goal in CF care. Recently, a clue to a potentially critical contributor to nutrient and energy uptake in children has emerged from the study of the microbes present in the gastrointestinal tract- the gut microbiota. Research has identified a complex relationship between gut microbiota, nutritional intake, nutrient absorption, and other health measures. GI tract microbes are known to contribute significantly to human nutrient metabolism and energy harvest, and they are altered in many disease states. Therefore, infant GI tract microbes may represent important determinants of CF nutritional outcomes, which in turn can significantly impact severity of lung disease and overall longevity. We recently showed that infants and children with CF had GI microbiota that differ markedly from those of children without CF, and that this dysbiosis correlated with severity of GI dysfunction. However, the relationships between CF GI microbiota with growth and other clinically important outcomes have not been studied. We hypothesize that the intestinal microbiomes among children with CF correlate with severity of malabsorption, intestinal inflammation, gastrointestinal signs and symptoms, vitamin and mineral deficiency, and nutritional status. To test these hypotheses, this ancillary study will define the fecal microbiomes of 250 infants with CF being enrolled in an ongoing multicenter study of infant nutrition (the Baby Observational NUtrition Study (BONUS), funded by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and the National Institutes of Health) using ultra high-throughput, culture-independent sequencing methods. With these resources, we will (1) define the fecal microbiomes, composed of the microbiota (the species of microbes present) and metagenomes (the microbial genes present, which reflects the metabolic capacity of the microbiota) of at least four stool samples per subject over the first year of life, and (2) determine the relationship of fecal microbiomes, and their evolution over the year of study, with nutritional and clinical parameters (including weight, height, body mass index, growth rate of each of these parameters among subjects, serum vitamin levels, fecal nutrient and metabolite content, GI symptoms, and measures of inflammation). We will use massively parallel next- generation DNA sequencing methods, combined with advanced bioinformatic analytical methods, with which we have extensive experience. Our goal is to define the role of the infant CF GI microbiome in growth and nutrition, with the hope of identifying interventions that will improve early growth, and thus long-term outcomes, in CF. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent scientific evidence suggests that the microbes that live in the gastrointestinal tracts of humans and other animals play key roles in the metabolism of nutrients, harvest of energy for the host, and the uptake of vitamins. Therefore, these microbes may be important contributors to diseases in which nutrients are poorly absorbed, the gastrointestinal tract is diseased, and/or the host grows poorly. The aim of this project is to determine the role of gastrointestinal microbes in the relentless and difficult-to-treat growth failure in children with the genetic disease cystic fibrosis, with the hope of both identifying interventions that will lead to better nutritional outcomes in these and in other children with poo early growth.",The relationship of fecal microbiomes and nutritional status in CF,9134726,R01DK095869,"['absorption ', ' Animals ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Bacteria ', ' Bacteroides ', ' Breastfeeding ', ' Breast Feeding ', ' Carbohydrates ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' Mucoviscidosis ', ' Cystic Fibrosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' E coli ', ' Escherichia coli ', ' Evolution ', ' Fats ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Fatty Acids ', ' Short-Chain Fatty Acids ', ' Volatile Fatty Acids ', ' stool ', ' Feces ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' gastrointestinal disorder ', ' Gastrointestinal Diseases and Manifestations ', ' Gastrointestinal Diseases ', ' digestive canal ', ' alimentary tract ', ' Gastrointestinal Tract ', ' GI Tract ', ' Digestive Tract ', ' Alimentary Canal ', ' Gastrointestinal tract structure ', ' Genes ', ' Bacterial Genes ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' hereditary disorder ', ' genetic disorder ', ' Molecular Disease ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' Genetic Condition ', ' Hereditary Disease ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' Immune system ', ' Infant ', ' infant nutrition ', ' Inflammation ', ' intestine disorder ', ' Intestinal Disorder ', ' Intestinal Diseases ', ' intestine obstruction ', ' Bowel Obstruction ', ' Intestinal Obstruction ', ' bowel ', ' Intestinal ', ' Intestines ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Lipids ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Lung ', ' lung disorder ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Lung diseases ', ' malabsorption ', ' intestinal malabsorption ', ' gastrointestinal absorption disorder ', ' Malabsorption Syndromes ', ' Methods ', ' Minerals ', ' Study models ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Structural Development of Human Fetal Brain Abstract Despite its critical significance, little is known about the most dynamic phase of brain development in infancy: 0-2 years. To change the status quo, comprehensive and quantitative infant brain atlases as reference standards for precision health are needed. In addition, diffusion MRI (dMRI) has entered a new era in which dynamic cortical internal microstructural complexity, indexed by e.g. cortical mean kurtosis derived from diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI), can be studied in the living infant brain noninvasively using more advanced multi-shell dMRI. Furthermore, multi-modality measures offer unparalleled insights into mechanistic structure- function and structure-behavior relationships. Work in the current cycle has focused on structural development of human fetal and preterm brains. Based on high resolution diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of 150 brains, we have established the atlases and quantified cortical microstructure with cortical fractional anisotropy, validated by histological images and correlated with transcriptomic (RNA) expression. Building upon this work, in the next cycle, we will focus on brain development in infancy, immediately after the fetal period. Specifically, the goal is to establish next-generation dMRI atlases (quantitative UPenn-CHOP infant brain atlases) and to harness a more advanced cortical microstructural mean kurtosis measurement by delineating its 4D spatiotemporal frameworks as well as uncovering its relationship to brain function and behavior during infancy (0-2 years). 160 typically developing infants at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 months will be recruited. Advanced “connectome-quality” multi-band high-resolution multi-shell dMRI, resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) and structural MRI will be acquired. High-quality whole-head magnetoencephalography (MEG) will also be acquired. Anatomical labels of all 122 major gray and white matter structures will be built up based on high contrasts from DTI-derived maps. The measurements of DTI-derived metrics will be used for the quantitative components of DTI atlases and age-dependent white matter tract trajectories (Aim 1). Mean kurtosis of the 4th order kurtosis tensor has been shown to be sensitive to cortical internal microstructural changes of infant brains. The spatiotemporal sensitivity of mean kurtosis measures to infant age and cortical region will be investigated (Aim 2). Furthermore, we will establish mechanistic structure-function relationships with multi- modality imaging, including not only multi-shell dMRI, but also rs-fMRI and MEG, all optimized for infant brains (Aim 3). The quantitative infant brain atlases and normal developmental trajectories will provide reference standards for “pre-“diagnostic risk assessment, filling a gap towards precision health for infants (e.g. Z-score maps). Infant cortical microstructure will be delineated noninvasively with 4D spatiotemporal frameworks. With multi-modality strength, the fundamental structure-function and structure-behavior mechanistic relations will set the stage for understanding aberrant brain development in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autistic spectrum disorder and intellectual disabilities in general.

With multi- modality strength, the fundamental structure-function and structure-behavior mechanistic relations will set the stage for understanding aberrant brain development in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autistic spectrum disorder and intellectual disabilities in general.",Structural Development of Human Fetal Brain,9247587,R01MH092535,"['abstracting ', ' Age ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Architecture ', ' Atlases ', ' Behavior ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Cerebral cortex ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Diffusion ', ' Fingerprint ', ' Goals ', ' substantia grisea ', ' gray matter ', ' Head ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' indexing ', ' Infant ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Magnetoencephalography ', ' Maps ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Reference Standards ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Rest ', ' structure function relationship ', ' chemical structure function ', ' Structure-Activity Relationship ', ' Time ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Anisotropy ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' prisma ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Infant Development ', ' Infant Health ', ' infantile ', ' infancy ', ' insight ', ' Visual ', ' Measurement ', ' Collaborations ', ' Staging ', ' Diagnostic ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Life ', ' Auditory ', ' Sensory ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' intellectual and developmental disability ', ' Intellectual limitation ', ' Intellectual disability ', ' Intellectual functioning disability ', ' fetal ', ' Sensorimotor functions ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neuronal circuit ', ' neuronal circuitry ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' substantia alba ', ' white matter ', ' Modality ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' dMRI ', ' Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Diffusion weighted imaging ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' DWI-MRI ', ' DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' behavioral assessment ', ' Behavior assessment ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Developmental Process ', ' Motor ', ' Resolution ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Neurological Development Disorder ', ' Neurodevelopmental Disorder ', ' Behavioral ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' next generation ', ' 2 year old ', ' two year old ', ' age 2 years ', ' somatosensory ', ' transcriptomics ', ' Four-dimensional ', ' 4-dimensional ', ' aging brain ', ' artemis ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' histological image ', ' histologic image ', ' connectome ', ' ']",NIMH,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,R01,2016,504581,PA-03,0.17044228260684363
"PREDICTING CHILDHOOD OUTCOMES IN PRETERM INFANTS USING CEREBRAL CONNECTIVITY DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Premature birth remains a major public health issue due to its continuing high incidence combined with the frequency of developmental impairments among surviving infants. In order to improve developmental outcomes in very preterm infants (VPT, born prior to 32 weeks' gestation), accurate and early identification of the alterations in brain development that lead to subsequent developmental impairment is required. The candidate for this K02 Independent Scientist Award is a uniquely trained pediatric neurologist who seeks to define the relationship between cerebral connectivity during infancy and childhood developmental outcomes. This project will involve a valuable, well-characterized VPT cohort (N=128) which includes high-risk children selected due to the presence of brain injury during the neonatal period. These children have undergone clinical characterization and MRI during the neonatal period and developmental assessment at age 2 years. They will now undergo standardized assessment of developmental outcomes at age 5 years. The central hypotheses are that VPT children will display a persisting range of motor and language difficulties, and that affected VPT children will display abnormalities on imaging measures obtained during infancy that predict childhood performance, both at the group and individual level, in these distinct and critical developmental domains. We propose to investigate these postulates by: 1) comprehensively evaluating childhood motor and language performance; 2) defining the relationship between alterations in domain-specific neonatal functional and structural connectivity and childhood motor and language outcomes; and 3) investigating differences in brain- wide cerebral connectivity in impaired VPT children using machine learning, pattern classification approach. The result will be characterization of the alterations in cerebral connectivity that underlie developmental disabilities in VPT children. In addition, we seek to develop highly valuable neuroimaging biomarkers that predict future motor and language impairment, enabling the provision of targeted care tailored to the needs of each individual infant. Finally, these tools will contribute to future, large-scale trials evaluating interventions designed to protect the developing brain. In pursuit of this goal, a focused career development program will complement the candidate's background in engineering and magnetic resonance methodology with training in developmental assessments and innovative image analysis approaches using applied mathematics, providing skills necessary to perform accurate longitudinal clinical research studies and develop individual prediction models. The supported activities will facilitate an NIH R-mechanism application centered upon innovative investigation of individual prediction models for developmental trajectories in VPT children during school-age, including repeat neuroimaging assessments during childhood. The culmination of these efforts will be transformative investigation that fosters improved outcomes for this high-risk population. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Despite continued high rates of disabilities in infants born prematurely, methods for accurately identifying those that would benefit most from specific therapies or protective interventions remain limited. This study is designed to improve our understanding of the alterations in brain function and structure that produce these deficits by using novel approaches to examine how magnetic resonance imaging data predicts early childhood outcomes. The goal is to identify imaging measures which identify preterm infants at risk for particular deficits, thereby allowing institution of timely therapies specific to each chid's needs and enabling larger research trials evaluating interventions designed to improve developmental outcomes in this vulnerable group.",PREDICTING CHILDHOOD OUTCOMES IN PRETERM INFANTS USING CEREBRAL CONNECTIVITY,9118361,K02NS089852,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' Award ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Child Development Disorders ', ' Developmental Disabilities ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Diffusion ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Evolution ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Incidence ', ' Infant ', ' preterm neonate ', ' preterm infant human ', ' preterm infant ', ' preterm baby ', ' premature infant human ', ' premature baby ', ' infants born prematurely ', ' infants born premature ', ' Premature Infant ', ' Language ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Language Development ', ' language deficit ', ' Language disability ', ' Language Disorders ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Maps ', ' Math ', ' Mathematics ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurobiology ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Measures ', ' Caring ', ' Premature Birth ', ' preterm delivery ', ' premature delivery ', ' premature childbirth ', ' Preterm Birth ', ' Pre-term birth ', ' improved ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' infantile ', ' infancy ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Neurologist ', ' cerebral ', ' Cerebrum ', ' Fostering ', ' school age ', ' School-Age Population ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' brain-injured ', ' brain damage ', ' Acquired brain injury ', ' Brain Injuries ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Frequencies ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Performance ', ' early childhood ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Modality ', ' motor deficit ', ' Early identification ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Magnetic Resonance ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' dMRI ', ' Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Diffusion weighted imaging ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' DWI-MRI ', ' DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' K02 Award ', ' Independent Scientist Award ', ' Motor ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' white matter injury ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' Neonatal ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' 2 year old ', ' two year old ', ' age 2 years ', ' 5 year old ', ' five year old ', ' age 5 years ', ' Impairment ', ' motor impairment ', ' movement limitation ', ' movement impairment ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' high risk ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted therapy ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' imaging biomarker ', ' imaging marker ', ' individual patient ', ' improved outcome ', ' neonatal brain ', ' language impairment ', ' ']",NINDS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K02,2016,191131,MO-01,0.05694045010863816
"The microbiome as a potential mediator of socio-economic disparities in preterm infant neurodevelopmental trajectories from NICU discharge to school age Project Summary/Abstract The goal of neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) care is not just survival of preterm infants, but also intact neurodevelopment for these vulnerable patients. Many factors affect neurodevelopment. Identification of factors that are modifiable at a time point early enough to improve the developmental trajectory of an individual infant is needed. While preterm infants are discharged from the NICU with a certain developmental potential based on their gestational age and clinical course, socioeconomic status (SES) of the home environment can significantly alter the developmental trajectory. Poverty increases risk for neurodevelopmental deterioration, resulting in significant health disparities. The means by which poverty alters neurodevelopment are unknown. The microbiome is influenced by environment and in turn influences brain development. We hypothesize that that the microbiome is a biologic effector of the influence of SES and environment on neurodevelopment. This proposal will focus on two key time points at which the microbiome is exposed to significant environmental alteration – first 2 weeks of life in the NICU and 6-12 months of life in the home environment. Longitudinal clinical data, patient microbial samples, environmental data, and SES data will be collected on established cohorts of preterm infants from five institutions across the United States already investigating the intestinal microbiome of preterm infants. Neurodevelopmental exams will be performed to assess the functional outcome of school readiness. The goal of this proposal is to demonstrate that microbiome development influences neurodevelopment. Furthermore we will identify environmental factors associated with SES that influence the microbiome and thus neurodevelopmental outcomes. Strengths of this proposal include distinctive expertise of the interdisciplinary investigative team in neonatal care, neurodevelopment, microbiome analysis, bioinformatics, economics, and analysis of environmental features of the home environment. Advanced sequencing techniques, spatial analysis of environmental factors (geomapping), and economic modeling will be used to investigate the relationships among SES, environment, microbiome, and neurodevelopmental outcome to identify a time point and possible environmental or microbiome modification to improve outcomes. Beyond increasing social strategies, expanding effective learning models, and mitigating medical needs of at risk infants, understanding and promoting shifts in the microbiome could lead to improved understanding of health disparities and enable interventions to alter infant neurodevelopmental-trajectories in innovative ways. Project Narrative Preterm infants are at risk for poor neurodevelopmental outcome due to their degree of prematurity, hospital course, and home environment. This proposal will study the changes in the bacterial colonization patterns of the infants in the context of their home environment to identify a potentially modifiable factor that may influence brain development and thus school readiness for these vulnerable infants.",The microbiome as a potential mediator of socio-economic disparities in preterm infant neurodevelopmental trajectories from NICU discharge to school age,9262661,UG3OD023281,"['abstracting ', ' Affect ', ' Biology ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' California ', ' Chicago ', ' Child Health ', ' Child health care ', ' Environmental Science ', ' Ecology ', ' Economic Models ', ' Economics ', ' Brain Inflammation ', ' Encephalitis ', ' Environment ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Florida ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Fetal Age ', ' Chronologic Fetal Maturity ', ' Gestational Age ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', "" Children's Hospital "", ' Pediatric Hospitals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Infant ', ' preterm neonate ', ' preterm infant human ', ' preterm infant ', ' preterm baby ', ' premature infant human ', ' premature baby ', ' infants born prematurely ', ' infants born premature ', ' Premature Infant ', ' neonatal ICU ', ' Newborn Intensive Care Units ', ' Neonatal Intensive Care Units ', ' bowel ', ' Intestinal ', ' Intestines ', ' Israel ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Microbiology ', ' Mammary Gland Milk ', "" Human Mother's Milk "", ' Breast Milk ', ' Human Milk ', ' Patients ', ' Poverty ', ' Risk ', ' rRNA ', ' Ribosomal RNA ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Schools ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Weaning ', ' Work ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Enteral Feeding ', ' tube feeding ', ' gastric feeding ', ' feeding tube ', ' enteric feeding ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Caring ', ' Sequence Analyses ', ' SEQ-AN ', ' Sequence Analysis ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Solid ', ' Clinical ', ' prematurity ', ' premature ', ' Medical ', ' Infant Development ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' school age ', ' School-Age Population ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' vulnerable infant ', ' high risk infant ', ' Event ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Medical center ', ' professor ', ' cohort ', ' microbial ', ' Neural Development ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' social ', ' Deterioration ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Qualifying ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Modification ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' in utero ', ' microbiome ', ' Human Microbiome ', ' Neurodevelopmental Impairment ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' microbial community ', ' patient population ', ' neonatal care ', ' built environment ', ' course development ', ' course material development ', ' class development ', ' gut microbiome ', ' intestinal microbiome ', ' gastrointestinal microbiome ', ' digestive tract microbiome ', ' improved outcome ', ' ']",OD,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,UG3,2016,1661003,IL-01,0.11323354795391448
"Infant statistical learning: Resilience, longevity, and specificity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Typically developing infants acquire language at a remarkable rate despite numerous perceptual and cognitive challenges. Infants may begin to learn language by tracking regularities in their environment. Specifically, research suggests that infants possess powerful computational mechanisms that may support the segmentation of words from fluent speech and facilitate word learning. The problem is that there is little research on the extent to which statistical regularities support early language acquisition under the challenging learning conditions often faced by young infants. The objective of the proposed research is to advance integrative and comprehensive theories of infant language acquisition by assessing how statistical learning supports (1) speech segmentation and word learning in background noise, (2) infants' ability to encode lexical representations in long-term memory, and (3) infants' abilities to represent newly segmented words with the appropriate level and type of detail to facilitate subsequent language learning. Three Aims will be addressed across nine experiments designed to test how statistical regularities found in natural language input support resilience, longevity, and representational specificity within a developmental framework. Infants will be familiarized with a short natural Italian language corpus and then tested on their ability o either discriminate words that have strong versus weak internal co-occurrence patterns (8- and 11-month-olds), or associate those words with novel objects (17-month-olds). Experiments are designed to tests how infants cope with simultaneous learning challenges. We will test the predictions that strong syllable co-occurrence patterns will bolster (1) speech segmentation and word learning in noise and (2) long-term memory for newly extracted words, and (3) that infants' word form representations will become more robust and specific. Results from the proposed project will advance our understanding of the learning mechanisms underlying normative language development. Individuals who are, for a variety of sensory, neurological, or developmental reasons, less adept at tracking and representing statistical regularities when faced with real-world learning challenges may be at greater risk for atypical language development. Results from the proposed research will be used to help generate and test hypotheses about the causal mechanisms for specific language delays in atypical populations, such as for infants with hearing loss or infants who, for various reasons, receive sub-optimal language input during critical developmental periods. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed set of studies explores potential mechanisms underlying positive language outcomes in typically developing infants. Being at risk for atypical language development poses a major health concern. The results of the project will help us generate testable hypotheses about the causal mechanisms for specific language delays in atypical populations, such as for infants with hearing loss or infants who, for various reasons, receive sub-optimal language input during critical developmental periods, and will begin to address NIH's need for evidence-based research to guide clinical practice.","Infant statistical learning: Resilience, longevity, and specificity",9116242,R01HD083312,"['Affect ', ' Felis sylvestris catus ', ' Felis domesticus ', ' Felis domestica ', ' Feline Species ', ' Domestic Cats ', ' Cats Mammals ', ' Cats ', ' Felis catus ', ' Bats ', ' Chiroptera ', ' critical developmental period ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Infant ', ' Language ', ' Language Delays ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Language Development ', ' Learning ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Memory ', ' Noise ', ' Phonetics ', ' Play ', ' Probability ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' sound ', ' Specificity ', ' Speech ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Gender ', ' Label ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Individual ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' long term memory ', ' Hour ', ' Complex ', ' Stream ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' theories ', ' Hypoacusis ', ' Hypoacuses ', ' Hearing Loss ', ' hearing impairment ', ' Address ', ' Cognitive ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Output ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' lexical ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' clinical practice ', ' natural language ', ' word learning ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE KNOXVILLE,R01,2016,263788,TN-02,0.006177857432726742
"CRCNS: Information Flow in the Brain During Language and Meaning Comprehension DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the past ten years a good deal has been learned from fMRI studies about the spatial patterns of neural activation used by the human brain to represent meanings of words and concepts. Much less is understood about the time evolution of this neural activity, including the temporally interrelated sub-processes the brain employs during the hundreds of milliseconds it takes to comprehend a single word, or the more complex processes it uses to construct and encode meaning of entire sentences as the words arrive one by one. We propose research to study, and to build computational models of, the detailed spatial and temporal neural activity observed during the comprehension of single words, phrases, sentences, and stories. This proposed research will specifically target the following questions: ""What information is encoded by neural activity where and when, and by which subprocesses in the brain, during the time it takes to comprehend a single word in isolation?"" ""What is the flow of information encoded when a newly sensed word first activates sensory cortex, then later results in neural activation encoding the word meaning?"" ""How does the brain integrate a newly encountered word in the context of earlier words in the sentence or phrase, to compose the meaning representation of the multi-word phrase or sentence?"" and ""How do semantic expectations and demands, together with syntactic sentence structure alter the processing of words, compared to processing the same words in isolation, or as an unstructured set such as {kick, Joe, ball}?"" To study these questions we will (1) devise novel experimental protocols to probe the flow of information encoded in neural signals during word and sentence processing, (2) collect new brain image data using both fMRI to achieve spatial resolution of a few millimeters, and MEG to achieve temporal resolution of a few milliseconds, (3) develop and apply novel machine learning approaches to build computational models that integrate and that predict this combined experimental data. Our goal is to develop an increasingly accurate computational model of how the brain comprehends words, phrases and sentences - a model that makes testable predictions about the neural activity observed in response to novel language stimuli. Intellectual Merit: This collaborative research brings together advanced machine learning algorithms with novel experimental protocols for MEG and fMRI brain imaging to advance our understanding of two fundamental open questions about the human brain: how does the brain represent meaning, and what neuro-cognitive processes construct that meaning piece-by-piece from perceived language stimuli? Broader Impacts: If successful, this research will impact a broad range of communities, including (1) cognitive neuroscience and computational linguistics, providing improved understanding of language processing in the brain, (2) machine learning, by driving the development of new methods for time series and latent variable analysis, integrating multiple data sets, and incorporating diverse  background knowledge as priors, (3) clinical studies of brain pathologies, especially those related to language processing, and informing treatment strategies for developmental and acquired language disorders (4) education of graduates, undergraduates and the general public, through dissemination of technical articles, teaching materials, and news about our work in the public press.

"The relationship of fecal microbiomes and nutritional status in CF ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intestinal tract disease is responsible for a substantial amount of the morbidity and mortality among people with the genetic disease cystic fibrosis (CF). The manifestations of CF intestinal disease frequently occur during infancy and result from pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (PI), resulting in profound nutrient malabsorption and malnutrition, and consequently in growth failure and intestinal obstruction. Despite aggressive, early nutritional intervention with pancreatic enzyme replacement and other therapies, early growth failure remains common among infants with CF, suggesting that characteristics other than PI contribute to growth and nutritional failure in infants with CF. The identification of thes growth and nutritional determinants in children with CF therefore remains a key research goal in CF care. Recently, a clue to a potentially critical contributor to nutrient and energy uptake in children has emerged from the study of the microbes present in the gastrointestinal tract- the gut microbiota. Research has identified a complex relationship between gut microbiota, nutritional intake, nutrient absorption, and other health measures. GI tract microbes are known to contribute significantly to human nutrient metabolism and energy harvest, and they are altered in many disease states. Therefore, infant GI tract microbes may represent important determinants of CF nutritional outcomes, which in turn can significantly impact severity of lung disease and overall longevity. We recently showed that infants and children with CF had GI microbiota that differ markedly from those of children without CF, and that this dysbiosis correlated with severity of GI dysfunction. However, the relationships between CF GI microbiota with growth and other clinically important outcomes have not been studied. We hypothesize that the intestinal microbiomes among children with CF correlate with severity of malabsorption, intestinal inflammation, gastrointestinal signs and symptoms, vitamin and mineral deficiency, and nutritional status. To test these hypotheses, this ancillary study will define the fecal microbiomes of 250 infants with CF being enrolled in an ongoing multicenter study of infant nutrition (the Baby Observational NUtrition Study (BONUS), funded by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and the National Institutes of Health) using ultra high-throughput, culture-independent sequencing methods. With these resources, we will (1) define the fecal microbiomes, composed of the microbiota (the species of microbes present) and metagenomes (the microbial genes present, which reflects the metabolic capacity of the microbiota) of at least four stool samples per subject over the first year of life, and (2) determine the relationship of fecal microbiomes, and their evolution over the year of study, with nutritional and clinical parameters (including weight, height, body mass index, growth rate of each of these parameters among subjects, serum vitamin levels, fecal nutrient and metabolite content, GI symptoms, and measures of inflammation). We will use massively parallel next- generation DNA sequencing methods, combined with advanced bioinformatic analytical methods, with which we have extensive experience. Our goal is to define the role of the infant CF GI microbiome in growth and nutrition, with the hope of identifying interventions that will improve early growth, and thus long-term outcomes, in CF. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent scientific evidence suggests that the microbes that live in the gastrointestinal tracts of humans and other animals play key roles in the metabolism of nutrients, harvest of energy for the host, and the uptake of vitamins.

"The microbiome as a potential mediator of socio-economic disparities in preterm infant neurodevelopmental trajectories from NICU discharge to school age Project Summary/Abstract The goal of neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) care is not just survival of preterm infants, but also intact neurodevelopment for these vulnerable patients. Many factors affect neurodevelopment. Identification of factors that are modifiable at a time point early enough to improve the developmental trajectory of an individual infant is needed. While preterm infants are discharged from the NICU with a certain developmental potential based on their gestational age and clinical course, socioeconomic status (SES) of the home environment can significantly alter the developmental trajectory. Poverty increases risk for neurodevelopmental deterioration, resulting in significant health disparities. The means by which poverty alters neurodevelopment are unknown. The microbiome is influenced by environment and in turn influences brain development. We hypothesize that that the microbiome is a biologic effector of the influence of SES and environment on neurodevelopment. This proposal will focus on two key time points at which the microbiome is exposed to significant environmental alteration – first 2 weeks of life in the NICU and 6-12 months of life in the home environment. Longitudinal clinical data, patient microbial samples, environmental data, and SES data will be collected on established cohorts of preterm infants from five institutions across the United States already investigating the intestinal microbiome of preterm infants. Neurodevelopmental exams will be performed to assess the functional outcome of school readiness. The goal of this proposal is to demonstrate that microbiome development influences neurodevelopment. Furthermore we will identify environmental factors associated with SES that influence the microbiome and thus neurodevelopmental outcomes. Strengths of this proposal include distinctive expertise of the interdisciplinary investigative team in neonatal care, neurodevelopment, microbiome analysis, bioinformatics, economics, and analysis of environmental features of the home environment. Advanced sequencing techniques, spatial analysis of environmental factors (geomapping), and economic modeling will be used to investigate the relationships among SES, environment, microbiome, and neurodevelopmental outcome to identify a time point and possible environmental or microbiome modification to improve outcomes. Beyond increasing social strategies, expanding effective learning models, and mitigating medical needs of at risk infants, understanding and promoting shifts in the microbiome could lead to improved understanding of health disparities and enable interventions to alter infant neurodevelopmental-trajectories in innovative ways. Project Narrative Preterm infants are at risk for poor neurodevelopmental outcome due to their degree of prematurity, hospital course, and home environment. This proposal will study the changes in the bacterial colonization patterns of the infants in the context of their home environment to identify a potentially modifiable factor that may influence brain development and thus school readiness for these vulnerable infants.",The microbiome as a potential mediator of socio-economic disparities in preterm infant neurodevelopmental trajectories from NICU discharge to school age,9355704,UG3OD023281,"['Affect ', ' Biology ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' California ', ' Chicago ', ' Child Health ', ' Child health care ', ' Environmental Science ', ' Ecology ', ' Economic Models ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Florida ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Fetal Age ', ' Chronologic Fetal Maturity ', ' Gestational Age ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', "" Children's Hospital "", ' Pediatric Hospitals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Infant ', ' Premature Infant ', ' preterm neonate ', ' preterm infant human ', ' preterm infant ', ' preterm baby ', ' premature infant human ', ' premature baby ', ' infants born prematurely ', ' infants born premature ', ' Inflammation ', ' Neonatal Intensive Care Units ', ' neonatal ICU ', ' Newborn Intensive Care Units ', ' Intestines ', ' bowel ', ' Intestinal ', ' Israel ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Microbiology ', ' Human Milk ', ' maternal milk ', "" Mother's Milk "", ' Mammary Gland Milk ', "" Human Mother's Milk "", ' Breastmilk ', ' Breast Milk ', ' Patients ', ' Poverty ', ' Risk ', ' Ribosomal RNA ', ' rRNA ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Weaning ', ' Work ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' tube feeding ', ' gastric feeding ', ' feeding tube ', ' enteric feeding ', ' Enteral Feeding ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Caring ', ' milk formula ', ' Baby Formula ', ' Infant formula ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Solid ', ' Clinical ', ' prematurity ', ' premature ', ' Medical ', ' Infant Development ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' school age ', ' School-Age Population ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' high risk infant ', ' vulnerable infant ', ' Event ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Medical center ', ' professor ', ' cohort ', ' microbial ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Neural Development ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' social ', ' Deterioration ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Institution ', ' Readiness ', ' Preparedness ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Modification ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' in utero ', ' microbiome ', ' Human Microbiome ', ' Neurodevelopmental Impairment ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' microbial community ', ' patient population ', ' neonatal care ', ' built environment ', ' course development ', ' course material development ', ' class development ', ' gut microbiome ', ' intestinal microbiome ', ' gastrointestinal microbiome ', ' digestive tract microbiome ', ' improved outcome ', ' ']",OD,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,UG3,2017,1679656,IL-01,0.11323354795391448
"Effects of prenatal cocaine on early brain functional connectivity and behavior ABSTRACT Prenatal cocaine exposure (PCE) is consistently related to impaired attention and behavioral and physiological self-regulation in infants and young children, suggesting persistent negative impact on skills essential for optimal learning and social competence. Gestational exposure to cocaine occurs during a time of extraordinary brain growth and organization, which is immediately followed by massive expansion and refinement of brain structure, functional connections and network organization in the first year of life. However, little is known about the effects of PCE on early human brain development that may contribute to reported deficits in cognition and neurobehavior. The objectives of this proposal are to quantify the effects of PCE on the developmental trajectory of infant brain functional connectivity in postnatal months 0-12, to determine associations with neurobehavioral and cognitive outcomes, and to examine how specific maternal caregiving characteristics (Sensitivity, Harshness) moderate these effects. Our central hypothesis is that fetal brain development and organization are altered by PCE; deficits in developing functional connections mediate the negative effects of PCE on simultaneously developing neurobehavior and early cognition; postnatal maternal behaviors and environment interact with PCE to influence growth trajectories of developing connections and networks that subserve emerging abilities. This hypothesis is based on the Co-PIs'strong preliminary data describing normative development of functional networks from birth to 2 years (Gao), disruptions in functional connectivity due to prenatal cocaine and other drugs in neonates (Grewen, Gao), and on Co-investigator Eiden's longitudinal studies of the behavioral effects of PCE and its moderation by maternal behaviors in infants, toddlers and children. We propose to study infant resting state functional connectivity and behavioral development at 2 weeks, 6 months and 12 months in 3 groups of infants: 120 with PCE with or without exposure to other drugs (nicotine, alcohol, marijuana, and/or opiates), 100 exposed to the same other drugs but without cocaine (OD), 100 drug-free (CTL). We will measure Maternal Sensitivity (primary), Maternal Harshness (secondary) and an index of cumulative environmental risk to determine postnatal moderation of PCE effects on developing connectivity. The rationale is that longitudinal study will reveal prenatal drug effects, determine whether the postnatal trajectory of brain functional connections is merely delayed or permanently altered by initial PCE insult, and ascertain postnatal factors contributing to greater risk or resilience in func- tional network development. This innovative approach will quantify direct and interactive effects of initial neural deficit and postnatal environmental influences on patterns of brain and cognitive development, and will apply hypothesis-driven and data-driven analytic methods, including machine learning, to characterize mechanisms underlying PCE effects on trajectory of brain development. Knowledge gleaned has potential to inform earlier, more effective interventions to prevent or reduce learning and behavioral impairments in this at-risk population. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will provide currently unavailable knowledge of the effects of prenatal cocaine and other drug exposures on developing brain functional connections and networks that subserve emerging behaviors and cognition in the first year of life, and will shed light on modifiable postnatal factors that may enhance or further impair early brain development. It is relevant to public health because discovery of mechanisms by which prenatal cocaine exposure influences development of brain and cognition in infancy will lead to earlier, more effective interventions to prevent or reduce later disabilities, as opposed to treatment in later childhood. This research is relevant to the mission of NIDA because it seeks to identify the physiological and social substrates and mechanisms involved in the cognitive and behavioral effects produced by drugs of abuse in an exceptionally vulnerable population— infants exposed in utero.",Effects of prenatal cocaine on early brain functional connectivity and behavior,9384304,R01DA042988,"['Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Alcohols ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' Animals ', ' Arousal ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Parturition ', ' Birth ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Cocaine ', ' Cognition ', ' Conflict ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Environment ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' indexing ', ' Infant ', ' Insula of Reil ', ' Island of Reil ', ' Insula ', ' Central Lobe ', ' Learning ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Marijuana ', ' marihuana ', ' Maternal Behavior ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' working memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Mothers ', ' Nicotine ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Rest ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Testing ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' thalamic ', ' Thalamus ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Glean ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' ventral tegmentum ', ' Ventral Tegmental Area ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' Lateral ', ' Anterior ', ' Dorsal ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' intraparietal sulcus ', ' disability ', ' infantile ', ' infancy ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Exposure to ', ' Opiates ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Parietal ', ' postnatal ', ' Pattern ', ' fetal ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' cingulate cortex ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Structure ', ' prenatal ', ' unborn ', ' Fetal Cocaine Exposure ', ' prenatally cocaine exposed ', ' prenatal cocaine exposure ', ' gestational cocaine exposure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Toddler ', ' social skills ', ' social competency ', ' social competence ', ' interpersonal competency ', ' interpersonal competence ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Drug Exposure ', ' prenatal exposure ', ' prenatally exposed ', ' intrauterine environmental exposure ', ' intra-uterine environmental exposure ', ' in utero exposure ', ' fetal exposure ', ' exposed in utero ', ' response ', ' neurobehavior ', ' executive function ', ' executive control ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Future Generations ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Data ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' Cognitive ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' neonate ', ' neurobehavioral ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Impairment ', ' drug of abuse ', ' drugs of abuse ', ' drugs abused ', ' abused drugs ', ' behavioral impairment ', ' impaired behavior ', ' effective intervention ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' cocaine exposure ', ' exposure to cocaine ', ' exposed to cocaine ', ' cocaine-exposed ', ' learning ability ', ' learning competence ', ' learning achievement ', ' cognitive development ', ' cognitive ability ', ' behavioral study ', ' behavior study ', ' maternal caregiving ', ' maternal care giving ', ' neonatal brain ', ' gender difference ', ' gender-associated difference ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2017,704051,NC-04,0.10935257254805393
"Structural Development of Human Fetal Brain Abstract Despite its critical significance, little is known about the most dynamic phase of brain development in infancy: 0-2 years. To change the status quo, comprehensive and quantitative infant brain atlases as reference standards for precision health are needed. In addition, diffusion MRI (dMRI) has entered a new era in which dynamic cortical internal microstructural complexity, indexed by e.g. cortical mean kurtosis derived from diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI), can be studied in the living infant brain noninvasively using more advanced multi-shell dMRI. Furthermore, multi-modality measures offer unparalleled insights into mechanistic structure- function and structure-behavior relationships. Work in the current cycle has focused on structural development of human fetal and preterm brains. Based on high resolution diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of 150 brains, we have established the atlases and quantified cortical microstructure with cortical fractional anisotropy, validated by histological images and correlated with transcriptomic (RNA) expression. Building upon this work, in the next cycle, we will focus on brain development in infancy, immediately after the fetal period. Specifically, the goal is to establish next-generation dMRI atlases (quantitative UPenn-CHOP infant brain atlases) and to harness a more advanced cortical microstructural mean kurtosis measurement by delineating its 4D spatiotemporal frameworks as well as uncovering its relationship to brain function and behavior during infancy (0-2 years). 160 typically developing infants at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 months will be recruited. Advanced “connectome-quality” multi-band high-resolution multi-shell dMRI, resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) and structural MRI will be acquired. High-quality whole-head magnetoencephalography (MEG) will also be acquired. Anatomical labels of all 122 major gray and white matter structures will be built up based on high contrasts from DTI-derived maps. The measurements of DTI-derived metrics will be used for the quantitative components of DTI atlases and age-dependent white matter tract trajectories (Aim 1). Mean kurtosis of the 4th order kurtosis tensor has been shown to be sensitive to cortical internal microstructural changes of infant brains. The spatiotemporal sensitivity of mean kurtosis measures to infant age and cortical region will be investigated (Aim 2). Furthermore, we will establish mechanistic structure-function relationships with multi- modality imaging, including not only multi-shell dMRI, but also rs-fMRI and MEG, all optimized for infant brains (Aim 3). The quantitative infant brain atlases and normal developmental trajectories will provide reference standards for “pre-“diagnostic risk assessment, filling a gap towards precision health for infants (e.g. Z-score maps). Infant cortical microstructure will be delineated noninvasively with 4D spatiotemporal frameworks. With multi-modality strength, the fundamental structure-function and structure-behavior mechanistic relations will set the stage for understanding aberrant brain development in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autistic spectrum disorder and intellectual disabilities in general.

"High-density markers of mother-infant bio-behavioral activity ""in the wild"": Developing a mobile-sensing paradigm to examine transmission of mental health risks Project Summary Major theories of socioemotional development suggest that adaptive patterns of self-regulation reflect the accumulation of thousands of individual daily experiences of distress. In particular, parents’ efforts to regulate their infants’ distress are thought to provide critical inputs to developing self-regulation skills. Factors affecting caregiving, such as caregiver stress or mood disorders, are thought to limit parents’ ability to provide this early support. Thus, early-emerging patterns of mother-infant interaction are theorized to be an important mechanism by which mental health risks are transmitted from caregivers to their children. However, empirical evidence for these theories are scarce, as it has not been possible to systematically capture episodes of distress as they occur in day-to-day mother and infant activity. Additionally, most studies cannot disentangle complex interactions between infant and maternal psychobiological factors. For example, highly fussy infants are more likely to stress and overwhelm their parents, thereby likely affecting parental regulation efforts and potentially exacerbating their own early biological predispositions. Datasets capturing the details of daily interactions between mothers and their infants are needed to access the basic bio-behavioral mechanisms of developing psychopathology risk. In the future, such rich datasets could also provide a foundation for emerging “just in time” interventions that could provide mothers with real-time support and reassurance during day-to-day activities. To thus advance the field of developmental psychopathology, this proposal will leverage emerging “wearable” or mobile-sensor technologies to capture episodes of infant distress and subsequent maternal regulation efforts as they occur in the typical day-to-day activities of infants and their mothers. The research aims of this proposal are 1) to develop a mobile-sensing platform that will automatically detect detailed markers of mother-infant distress-related activity as participants go about their daily lives, captured via a synchronized suite of “wearable” physiology, audio and proximity sensors, and once validated, to use this platform to 2) investigate the daily mechanisms of maladaptive mother-infant interaction dynamics The training goals of this proposal are to 1) develop my expertise with state-of-the art computational tools to study mother-infant activity in the “wild”, allowing me unprecedented access to the dynamic processes of bio- behavioral development, and 2) to provide me the opportunity bridge my work to the domain of developmental psychopathology. The proposed K01 is thus a key step in my goal to develop a research program that can harness the rich dynamics of day-to-day activity to support theoretically-driven clinical innovations. Children of mothers with depression anxiety and stress are at increased risk for a range of maladaptive outcomes, including both internalizing and externalizing mental health disorders. The current training proposal will develop a state-of-the-art mobile sensor paradigm to capture high-density ecologically valid markers of mother-infant interactions—a key mechanism of the transmission of psychopathology from mothers to their children—and use this paradigm to examine how daily activity and exposures contribute to adaptive and maladaptive dynamics of mother-infant interaction.","High-density markers of mother-infant bio-behavioral activity ""in the wild"": Developing a mobile-sensing paradigm to examine transmission of mental health risks",9386536,K01MH111957,"['Affect ', ' Anxiety ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' childrearing ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' Parenting ', ' Child Rearing ', ' Data Collection ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Feedback ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human Development ', ' Infant ', ' Laboratories ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Moods ', ' Mothers ', ' Motion ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Parents ', ' Physiology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Stress ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Ecological Systems ', ' Ecologic Systems ', ' Ecosystem ', ' density ', ' sensor ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Training ', ' Distress ', ' infantile ', ' infancy ', ' Individual ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' experience ', ' trait ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' developmental psychology ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Emotional ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Caregiver Burden ', ' caregiver stress ', ' care giver stress ', ' Care giver Burden ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Preventive ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Resolution ', ' Emergent Technologies ', ' Emerging Technologies ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' care giving ', ' caregiving ', ' biobehavioral ', ' biobehavior ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' Outcome ', ' Individual Differences ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' maternal depression ', ' depressed mother ', ' psychobiologic ', ' psychobiological ', ' high risk ', ' novel marker ', ' novel biomarker ', ' new marker ', ' Systems Development ', ' stress disorder ', ' discrete time ', ' ']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",K01,2017,118352,TX-10,0.06987876923361716
"Infant statistical learning: Resilience, longevity, and specificity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Typically developing infants acquire language at a remarkable rate despite numerous perceptual and cognitive challenges. Infants may begin to learn language by tracking regularities in their environment. Specifically, research suggests that infants possess powerful computational mechanisms that may support the segmentation of words from fluent speech and facilitate word learning. The problem is that there is little research on the extent to which statistical regularities support early language acquisition under the challenging learning conditions often faced by young infants. The objective of the proposed research is to advance integrative and comprehensive theories of infant language acquisition by assessing how statistical learning supports (1) speech segmentation and word learning in background noise, (2) infants' ability to encode lexical representations in long-term memory, and (3) infants' abilities to represent newly segmented words with the appropriate level and type of detail to facilitate subsequent language learning. Three Aims will be addressed across nine experiments designed to test how statistical regularities found in natural language input support resilience, longevity, and representational specificity within a developmental framework. Infants will be familiarized with a short natural Italian language corpus and then tested on their ability o either discriminate words that have strong versus weak internal co-occurrence patterns (8- and 11-month-olds), or associate those words with novel objects (17-month-olds). Experiments are designed to tests how infants cope with simultaneous learning challenges. We will test the predictions that strong syllable co-occurrence patterns will bolster (1) speech segmentation and word learning in noise and (2) long-term memory for newly extracted words, and (3) that infants' word form representations will become more robust and specific. Results from the proposed project will advance our understanding of the learning mechanisms underlying normative language development. Individuals who are, for a variety of sensory, neurological, or developmental reasons, less adept at tracking and representing statistical regularities when faced with real-world learning challenges may be at greater risk for atypical language development. Results from the proposed research will be used to help generate and test hypotheses about the causal mechanisms for specific language delays in atypical populations, such as for infants with hearing loss or infants who, for various reasons, receive sub-optimal language input during critical developmental periods.

"PREDICTING CHILDHOOD OUTCOMES IN PRETERM INFANTS USING CEREBRAL CONNECTIVITY DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Premature birth remains a major public health issue due to its continuing high incidence combined with the frequency of developmental impairments among surviving infants. In order to improve developmental outcomes in very preterm infants (VPT, born prior to 32 weeks' gestation), accurate and early identification of the alterations in brain development that lead to subsequent developmental impairment is required. The candidate for this K02 Independent Scientist Award is a uniquely trained pediatric neurologist who seeks to define the relationship between cerebral connectivity during infancy and childhood developmental outcomes. This project will involve a valuable, well-characterized VPT cohort (N=128) which includes high-risk children selected due to the presence of brain injury during the neonatal period. These children have undergone clinical characterization and MRI during the neonatal period and developmental assessment at age 2 years. They will now undergo standardized assessment of developmental outcomes at age 5 years. The central hypotheses are that VPT children will display a persisting range of motor and language difficulties, and that affected VPT children will display abnormalities on imaging measures obtained during infancy that predict childhood performance, both at the group and individual level, in these distinct and critical developmental domains. We propose to investigate these postulates by: 1) comprehensively evaluating childhood motor and language performance; 2) defining the relationship between alterations in domain-specific neonatal functional and structural connectivity and childhood motor and language outcomes; and 3) investigating differences in brain- wide cerebral connectivity in impaired VPT children using machine learning, pattern classification approach. The result will be characterization of the alterations in cerebral connectivity that underlie developmental disabilities in VPT children. In addition, we seek to develop highly valuable neuroimaging biomarkers that predict future motor and language impairment, enabling the provision of targeted care tailored to the needs of each individual infant. Finally, these tools will contribute to future, large-scale trials evaluating interventions designed to protect the developing brain. In pursuit of this goal, a focused career development program will complement the candidate's background in engineering and magnetic resonance methodology with training in developmental assessments and innovative image analysis approaches using applied mathematics, providing skills necessary to perform accurate longitudinal clinical research studies and develop individual prediction models. The supported activities will facilitate an NIH R-mechanism application centered upon innovative investigation of individual prediction models for developmental trajectories in VPT children during school-age, including repeat neuroimaging assessments during childhood. The culmination of these efforts will be transformative investigation that fosters improved outcomes for this high-risk population. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Despite continued high rates of disabilities in infants born prematurely, methods for accurately identifying those that would benefit most from specific therapies or protective interventions remain limited. This study is designed to improve our understanding of the alterations in brain function and structure that produce these deficits by using novel approaches to examine how magnetic resonance imaging data predicts early childhood outcomes.

"High-density markers of mother-infant bio-behavioral activity ""in the wild"": Developing a mobile-sensing paradigm to examine transmission of mental health risks Project Summary Major theories of socioemotional development suggest that adaptive patterns of self-regulation reflect the accumulation of thousands of individual daily experiences of distress. In particular, parents’ efforts to regulate their infants’ distress are thought to provide critical inputs to developing self-regulation skills. Factors affecting caregiving, such as caregiver stress or mood disorders, are thought to limit parents’ ability to provide this early support. Thus, early-emerging patterns of mother-infant interaction are theorized to be an important mechanism by which mental health risks are transmitted from caregivers to their children. However, empirical evidence for these theories are scarce, as it has not been possible to systematically capture episodes of distress as they occur in day-to-day mother and infant activity. Additionally, most studies cannot disentangle complex interactions between infant and maternal psychobiological factors. For example, highly fussy infants are more likely to stress and overwhelm their parents, thereby likely affecting parental regulation efforts and potentially exacerbating their own early biological predispositions. Datasets capturing the details of daily interactions between mothers and their infants are needed to access the basic bio-behavioral mechanisms of developing psychopathology risk. In the future, such rich datasets could also provide a foundation for emerging “just in time” interventions that could provide mothers with real-time support and reassurance during day-to-day activities. To thus advance the field of developmental psychopathology, this proposal will leverage emerging “wearable” or mobile-sensor technologies to capture episodes of infant distress and subsequent maternal regulation efforts as they occur in the typical day-to-day activities of infants and their mothers. The research aims of this proposal are 1) to develop a mobile-sensing platform that will automatically detect detailed markers of mother-infant distress-related activity as participants go about their daily lives, captured via a synchronized suite of “wearable” physiology, audio and proximity sensors, and once validated, to use this platform to 2) investigate the daily mechanisms of maladaptive mother-infant interaction dynamics The training goals of this proposal are to 1) develop my expertise with state-of-the art computational tools to study mother-infant activity in the “wild”, allowing me unprecedented access to the dynamic processes of bio- behavioral development, and 2) to provide me the opportunity bridge my work to the domain of developmental psychopathology. The proposed K01 is thus a key step in my goal to develop a research program that can harness the rich dynamics of day-to-day activity to support theoretically-driven clinical innovations. Children of mothers with depression anxiety and stress are at increased risk for a range of maladaptive outcomes, including both internalizing and externalizing mental health disorders. The current training proposal will develop a state-of-the-art mobile sensor paradigm to capture high-density ecologically valid markers of mother-infant interactions—a key mechanism of the transmission of psychopathology from mothers to their children—and use this paradigm to examine how daily activity and exposures contribute to adaptive and maladaptive dynamics of mother-infant interaction.","High-density markers of mother-infant bio-behavioral activity ""in the wild"": Developing a mobile-sensing paradigm to examine transmission of mental health risks",9545867,K01MH111957,"['Affect ', ' Anxiety ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Rearing ', ' childrearing ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' Parenting ', ' Data Collection ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Feedback ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human Development ', ' Infant ', ' Laboratories ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Moods ', ' Mothers ', ' Motion ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Parents ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Physiology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Ecological Systems ', ' Ecologic Systems ', ' Ecosystem ', ' density ', ' sensor ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Training ', ' Distress ', ' infantile ', ' infancy ', ' Individual ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' experience ', ' trait ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' developmental psychology ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Emotional ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Caregiver Burden ', ' caregiver stress ', ' care giver stress ', ' Care giver Burden ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Preventive ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Resolution ', ' Emergent Technologies ', ' Emerging Technologies ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' care giving ', ' caregiving ', ' biobehavioral ', ' biobehavior ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' Outcome ', ' Individual Differences ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' depressed mother ', ' maternal depression ', ' psychobiological ', ' psychobiologic ', ' high risk ', ' novel biomarker ', ' new marker ', ' novel marker ', ' Systems Development ', ' stress disorder ', ' discrete time ', ' sensing technology ', ' sensor technology ', ' wireless sensor technology ', ' wearable sensor technology ', ' ']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",K01,2018,117680,TX-10,0.06987876923361716
"Infant statistical learning: Resilience, longevity, and specificity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Typically developing infants acquire language at a remarkable rate despite numerous perceptual and cognitive challenges. Infants may begin to learn language by tracking regularities in their environment. Specifically, research suggests that infants possess powerful computational mechanisms that may support the segmentation of words from fluent speech and facilitate word learning. The problem is that there is little research on the extent to which statistical regularities support early language acquisition under the challenging learning conditions often faced by young infants. The objective of the proposed research is to advance integrative and comprehensive theories of infant language acquisition by assessing how statistical learning supports (1) speech segmentation and word learning in background noise, (2) infants' ability to encode lexical representations in long-term memory, and (3) infants' abilities to represent newly segmented words with the appropriate level and type of detail to facilitate subsequent language learning. Three Aims will be addressed across nine experiments designed to test how statistical regularities found in natural language input support resilience, longevity, and representational specificity within a developmental framework. Infants will be familiarized with a short natural Italian language corpus and then tested on their ability o either discriminate words that have strong versus weak internal co-occurrence patterns (8- and 11-month-olds), or associate those words with novel objects (17-month-olds). Experiments are designed to tests how infants cope with simultaneous learning challenges. We will test the predictions that strong syllable co-occurrence patterns will bolster (1) speech segmentation and word learning in noise and (2) long-term memory for newly extracted words, and (3) that infants' word form representations will become more robust and specific. Results from the proposed project will advance our understanding of the learning mechanisms underlying normative language development. Individuals who are, for a variety of sensory, neurological, or developmental reasons, less adept at tracking and representing statistical regularities when faced with real-world learning challenges may be at greater risk for atypical language development. Results from the proposed research will be used to help generate and test hypotheses about the causal mechanisms for specific language delays in atypical populations, such as for infants with hearing loss or infants who, for various reasons, receive sub-optimal language input during critical developmental periods.

"What you see is what you learn: Visual attention in statistical word learning PROJECT SUMMARY Individual differences in the quantity and quality of parent talk and individual differences in infant visual attention predict later vocabulary development, which in turn has the cascading consequences of later cognitive development and school achievement. The proposed research studies how infants prior to their first birthday begin to learn object names, and does so in a unique approach, focusing on how visual information from the infant perspective coincide with parent naming and on how infant looking behavior selects the data to be aggregated and how that selected data changes incrementally in statistical learning. Toward this goal, we will collect a corpus of infant-perspective scenes from 8-12-month-old infants as they play with their parent in a toy room and as parents naturally name objects during play. We will analyze the referential ambiguity of the scenes that co-occur with parent naming events, by showing the scenes to infants and tracking their gaze direction in free viewing. We will use the gaze data to quantify ambiguity in terms of the uncertainty, correctness, and informativeness of the scenes as to the intended object referent. We will then construct training sets for cross-situational learning experiments from the collected scenes by manipulating the mix of high and low ambiguity trials. We will test a series of hypotheses about how infants aggregate information to learn multiple object names.  Moreover, we will feed the trial-by-trial gaze data of individual infants to models to predict final learning outcomes, with the goal of specifying attentional and memory processes that support learning. Our overarching aim of the project is to show that the infant-perspective scenes co- occurring with early naming events have properties that guide and train infant visual attention and in so doing support the learning of names and their referents through the aggregation of information across multiple naming events.

"A Longitudinal MRI Study Characterizing Very Early Brain Development in Infants with Down Syndrome Longitudinal MRI Characterization of Very Early Brain Development  in Infants with Down Syndrome Project Summary/Abstract Down syndrome (DS), the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability, is associated with varying degrees of cognitive and behavioral impairments. Pharmacologic therapies and genetic modulators are emerging which, if administered early in conjunction with traditional therapies, show promise for improving developmental outcomes in children with DS. However, the stark absence of early neurodevelopment knowledge in DS hampers these efforts. The main goal of this proposal is to develop biomarkers as future targets for specific therapies based on careful characterization of early aberrant neurodevelopmental patterns. This study will be a combined effort with WU as the coordinating center and six other research groups: UNC, UW, CHOP, MNI, NYU, and University of Minnesota. These groups comprise the ACE-IBIS (Autism Center of Excellence Infant Brain Imaging Study) network, a well-established and experienced group that has been productively collaborating for 8 years on MRI imaging and behavioral characterization of infants at high risk for autism, healthy typical infants (TYP), and infants with Fragile X. The aims of this proposal are: 1) Define the longitudinal characteristics of early brain development in infants (3 to 24 months) with DS in comparison to TYP infants and infants with other developmental disabilities (ASD and Fragile X) using three different types of neuroimaging (MRI, DTI, rsfMRI); 2) Develop predictive models for developmental outcomes in infants with DS based on longitudinal structural or functional MRI characteristics; and 3) Characterize brain-behavior correlates with coordinated multimodal imaging in infancy characterizing the interrelationship between longitudinal network imaging parameters and cognitive, behavioral and neurodevelopmental outcomes using sophisticated multivariate support vector machine (SVM) analytic strategies. 120 infants with DS and 40 TYP control infants will be followed longitudinally from 3 to 24 months. MRI scans will be obtained during natural sleep and a series of well-validated developmental and behavioral assessments will be completed at each visit. This project will be the first to define the nature and timing of alterations in brain development in infants with DS. The proposed project addresses several key research recommendations from the “NICHD 2014-The NIH Research Plan on Down Syndrome.” The study aims match the recommendation for the quantitative characterization based on imaging of early brain development and the relationship of cognitive, behavioral and social development to early aberrant neurodevelopment in DS. This project will also address recommendations for investigation of comorbid ASD in DS, which could be as high as 5-10%. The IBIS network is uniquely qualified to examine early neurodevelopmental patterns, utilizing the ASD, TYP and FraX infant data sets to better characterize and examine specificity of DS early developmental patterns including ASD qualities and impairments in social development. It is clear that quantification of neurodevelopmental trajectories in infants with DS will be critical to identification of personalized intervention strategies and to assess the efficacy of early life, targeted, highly novel and mechanistically specific DS interventions. Project Narrative Down's syndrome (DS), the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability, is associated with a wide range of cognitive and behavioral impairments. Through the use of cutting edge MRI technology that allows us to look at the shape, function, and connections within the brain, we will be able to study and better understand early brain development in infants with DS. Working toward the goal to be able to assess the impact of specific early intervention therapies that are most helpful in improving the developmental outcomes of children with DS. This study mirrors and expands on the study designs and techniques that were developed to study infants with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), Fragile X, and typically developing infants, and will allow us to further our understanding of maturation patterns of infant brains that we can apply to DS, ASD, Fragile X, and other disabilities.",A Longitudinal MRI Study Characterizing Very Early Brain

"An Automated Early Motor Development Risk Screener from Observational Video Recordings of Infants and Toddlers Motor development plays a pivotal role in an infant’s overall development and has a cascading effect on social, cognitive, memory, and language ability. These functions can be compromised when motor development is disrupted; motor disruption is associated with generalized developmental delays. Early screening and identification of delays can allow early interventions with the goal of not just improving motor function but overall development in other domains. Experience with independent or motorized crawling is shown to improve spatial memory in infants. Active motor training, even as early as 3 months, is shown to achieve gains in object exploration and social engagement that persist long after the training sessions, indicating the benefits of early intervention. Children who get developmental screening are more likely to be identified with delays and receive early intervention services compared to those that only receive age-appropriate milestone checks as part of pediatric well-child visits. However, comprehensive motor screening, using standardized instruments, for developmental surveillance is labor intensive and requires specialized training in administration and evaluation. Shortage of resources to perform frequent, gold-standard, comprehensive motor assessments can lead to missed opportunities for early intervention and contribute negatively to lifelong outcomes for infants at risk for behavioral and developmental disorders. In the US, 15-20% of children have a developmental or behavioral disability, but less than a third of them get diagnosed before entering school, preventing opportunities for early intervention during a critical period of brain development. In Phase I, we built a prototype Human Action Recognition Engine (HARE) to automate extraction of infant motor movement from video; then utilized this engine to demonstrate the feasibility of an automated developmental risk screener by leveraging recent advances in machine learning to achieve state of the art accuracies in assessment of infant motor development. In Phase II, we aim to build out the risk screener, SCOREIT, as a clinically deployable, cost-effective, developmental risk assessment tool to identify children who need further clinical follow-up. SCOREIT has the potential to transform early developmental screening by bringing the power of comprehensive motor screening, usually administered only to at-risk children utilizing specialized resources, to underserved and economically-fragile communities. Less than a third of US children receive developmental screening. SCOREIT can bring risk screenings to the over 70% of children that currently do not receive them, increasing opportunities for early intervention for behavioral and developmental disorders. Additionally, the HARE system’s ability to automatically extract and quantify motor movements from video can be an enabler for explorations of early markers for behavioral and developmental disorders, significantly easing manual video coding burdens and accelerating the pace of discoveries. This proposal introduces an automated, portable, low-cost developmental risk assessment tool, SCOREIT, that leverages advances in machine learning to extract motor movements from infant videos and generate a motor developmental score based on a standardized instrument (Alberta Infant Motor Scale; AIMS). SCOREIT has the potential to transform early developmental risk screening by bringing the power of standardized, comprehensive motor screening to underserved, economically-fragile communities, and increase opportunities for early intervention of developmental disorders.",An Automated Early Motor Development Risk Screener from Observational Video Recordings of Infants and Toddlers,9558014,R44HD095783,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Alberta province ', ' Alberta ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Behavior Disorders ', ' behavioral disorder ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Cerebral Palsy ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Developmental Coordination Disorders ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Infant ', ' Language ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Manuals ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Occupational Therapy ', ' Parents ', ' Pediatrics ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Play ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' Standardization ', ' Supination ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Video Recording ', ' video recording system ', ' Videorecording ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Developmental Delay Disorders ', ' Specific Child Development Disorders ', ' Developmental Delay ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' screening tools ', ' Screening procedure ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' instrument ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Catalogs ', ' Complex ', ' Stream ', ' System ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Toddler ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Early identification ', ' Modeling ', ' portability ', ' Physical therapy ', ' Physiotherapy ', ' Physical Therapeutics ', ' Physical Medicine Procedure ', ' Physiatric Procedure ', ' developmental disease ', ' developmental disorder ', ' Provider ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Motor ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' data acquisition ', ' infant outcome ', ' service intervention ', ' prototype ', ' high risk ', ' critical period ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' screening ', ' improved motor function ', ' motor function improvement ', ' cognitive performance ', ' spatial memory ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' Assessment tool ', ' learning network ', ' social participation ', ' social involvement ', ' social engagement ', ' early screening ', ' deep learning ', ' ']",NICHD,"BSOLUTIONS, INC.",R44,2018,605627,WA-07,0.054805158693489994
"Effects of Prenatal Opiates on Infant Brain and Neurobehavioral Development ABSTRACT Opioid use during pregnancy has increased dramatically in the past decade, and may pose significant health challenges for the rapidly growing number of exposed infants born to mothers using illicit and/or prescribed opioids. Prenatal opioid exposure (OE) is inconsistently related to impaired neurobehavior, attention, and cognition in infancy and childhood, suggesting persistent, potentially life-long, consequences. This fetal exposure occurs during a time of extraordinary brain growth and organization, making it a critical period of vulnerability to environmental insult. However, little is known about the effects of OE on early human brain development that may contribute to reported deficits. The objectives of this proposal are to quantify the effects of OE on the development of infant brain functional connectivity in postnatal months 1-12, to determine associations with neurobehavioral and cognitive outcomes, and to examine how gender, other prenatal drug exposures, and postnatal environmental factors moderate these effects. Our central hypothesis is that fetal brain development and organization are altered by OE; deficits in developing connections and networks mediate the negative effects of OE on simultaneously developing neurobehavior and early cognition; gender, other drugs and postnatal environment interact with OE to influence growth trajectories of rapidly developing connections and networks that subserve emerging abilities. This hypothesis is based on the study team’s substantial research experience with mother-infant dyads with prenatal opioid and other drug exposures (Jones, Grewen), and on strong preliminary data showing normative development of functional networks from birth to 2 years (Gao), disruptions in neonatal functional connectivity due to prenatal opioids and other drugs (Grewen, Gao), and on associations between functional connections and behavioral effects (Grewen, Gao). The rationale for the proposed research is that longitudinal study will quantify direct and interactive effects of initial neural insult, infant gender and postnatal environment on developing functional connections. The hypotheses will be tested with 3 Specific Aims: 1) Quantify the extent to which OE impairs developing functional connections at 2 weeks and again at 12 months; 2) Determine the extent to which the effects of OE on neurobehavior, attention, self-regulation and cognition are related to developmental trajectories of functional connections; 3) Determine how infant gender, other prenatal drug exposures, and a Cumulative Environmental Risk Index moderate the effects of OE on developing connectivity. This approach is innovative because it will employ hypothesis-driven analyses as well as novel, exploratory data-driven and machine learning methods to quantify direct and interactive effects of OE and other drug exposures on functional circuitry. The proposed research is significant because rates of prenatal OE and NAS have increased 5-fold since 2000, in parallel with the opioid epidemic, and because knowledge gleaned has potential to identify factors that may protect or further harm growing functional networks underlying nascent cognitive abilities in this at-risk group. NARRATIVE The proposed research will provide currently unavailable knowledge of the effects of prenatal opioid and other drug exposures on developing brain functional connections and networks that subserve emerging behaviors and cognition in the first year of life, and will shed light on modifiable postnatal factors that may enhance or further impair early brain development. At a broader level, this work is relevant to understanding brain mechanisms underlying developing attention/arousal systems and how these brain-behavior connections may be altered by biological or environmental challenges. It is relevant to public health because the number of women using opioids during pregnancy is rapidly growing, in parallel with the current opioid epidemic. This research is relevant to NIDA’s mission because it seeks to identify the physiological and social substrates and mechanisms involved in the cognitive and behavioral effects produced by drugs of abuse in an exceptionally vulnerable population--infants exposed in utero.",Effects of Prenatal Opiates on Infant Brain and Neurobehavioral Development,9524072,R01DA043678,"['Alcohols ', ' Alcohol

"Early Prediction of Cognitive Deficits in Very Preterm Infants using Machine Learning and Brain Connectome Project Summary/Abstract The high risk of neurodevelopmental impairments is a major concern for parents and clinicians caring for premature babies. Annually, approximately 22,000 very preterm infants (i.e. ≤32 weeks gestational age) in the United States develop cognitive deficits. Efforts to target interventions to prevent neurodevelopmental sequelae are hampered by our current inability to diagnose disabilities before the age of 3 to 5 years. Research supports the notion that cognitive deficits may result from a perturbation of neural connection and communication. Recent brain connectome studies in adults and older children show that abnormal network properties are useful as prognostic biomarkers. Many of these studies have exploited machine learning models based on brain connectome data for the prediction of a variety of neurological conditions, however this progress has not been fully extended to the preterm population. Our preliminary studies suggest that early and accurate prediction of cognitive deficits at an individual level is possible using machine learning models based on brain connectome features at term corrected age (CA). We have correctly classified 91.3% of very preterm infants at high risk of cognitive deficits with 90% specificity and 92.3% sensitivity. Our overall objective is to develop a robust machine learning model that can analyze integrated structural and functional brain connectome data obtained at term CA to make a prediction of later cognitive deficits in very preterm infants. Our central hypothesis is that machine learning techniques analyzing integrated structural and functional brain connectome features at birth can predict cognitive deficits at 2 years CA at an individual level in very preterm infants with accuracy of greater than 90%, exceeding the performance of current classical multivariate analyses. The two specific aims to test the central hypothesis are: 1) Develop and implement a machine learning model to extract high-level brain connectome features and 2) Develop and validate a machine learning framework to predict cognitive deficits. On completion of the first aim, we will explicate the brain connectome, and extract high-dimensional connectome features that best represent the brain connectome. In the second aim, the machine learning model we proposed will be applied in predicting both cognitive deficit (i.e. 2-class classification) and cognitive scores on a continuous scale (i.e., regression) at 2 years CA. To quantify the model's discrimination, we will also validate its performance in data that are not used for the model development, and compare with the current conventional multivariate approach. The proposed research is significant because it will increase scientific knowledge about the developing brain connectome in very preterm infants and facilitate earlier identification of babies at high risk of neurodevelopmental deficits, allowing timely clinical interventions for optimal cognitive outcome. Project Narrative Babies born before 32 weeks' gestational age are at a very high risk of developing cognitive deficits, which may impact their brain function in many ways, including life-long learning difficulties. Fortunately, infant brains are highly malleable, so it is important to identify those at highest risk as early as possible to allow effective early interventions. We propose to apply a reliable, accurate and sensitive artificial intelligence approach based on state-of-the-art brain MRI to allow identification of babies at highest risk of learning difficulties.",Early Prediction of Cognitive Deficits in Very Preterm Infants using Machine Learning and Brain Connectome,9432651,R21HD094085,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Rearing ', ' childrearing ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' Parenting ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communication ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Exhibits ', ' Gestational Age ', ' Fetal Age ', ' Chronologic Fetal Maturity ', ' Goals ', ' Pediatric Hospitals ', "" Children's Hospital "", ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Infant ', ' Premature Infant ', ' preterm neonate ', ' preterm infant human ', ' preterm infant ', ' preterm baby ', ' premature infant human ', ' premature baby ', ' pre-term neonate ', ' pre-term infant ', ' pre-term baby ', ' pre-mature baby ', ' infants born prematurely ', ' infants born premature ', ' infants born pre-mature ', ' Learning ', ' Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Acute, L1 ', ' infant ALL ', ' Pediatric Acute Lymphoid Leukemia ', ' Pediatric Acute Lymphogenous Leukemia ', ' Pediatric Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia ', ' Pediatric Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia ', ' Pediatric ALL ', ' Lymphoblastic Leukemia, Acute, L1 ', ' L1 Lymphocytic Leukemia ', ' Childhood Acute Lymphoid Leukemia ', ' Childhood Acute Lymphogenous Leukemia ', ' Childhood Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia ', ' Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia ', ' Childhood ALL ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Multivariate Analysis ', ' Multivariate Analyses ', ' Neuronal Plasticity ', ' neuroplasticity ', ' neuroplastic ', ' neural plasticity ', ' CNS plasticity ', ' Parents ', ' Physiology ', ' Research ', ' Research Support ', ' Rest ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' medical complication ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Funding ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' high risk infant ', ' vulnerable infant ', ' Scanning ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Neurologic Deficit ', ' interest ', ' Performance ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Neural Development ', ' Cognitive deficits ', ' cognitive defects ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' social ', ' Early identification ', ' Modeling ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Property ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' model development ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' dMRI ', ' Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Diffusion weighted imaging ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' DWI-MRI ', ' DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) ', ' Institution ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Data ', ' Prognostic Marker ', ' prognostic indicator ', ' prognostic biomarker ', ' Prognosis Marker ', ' Molecular Marker of Prognosis ', ' Cognitive ', ' Validation ', ' sex ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' neonate ', ' Neurodevelopmental Deficit ', ' Neurodevelopmental Impairment ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' Neonatal ', ' Population ', ' Mind ', ' five years of age ', ' five year old ', ' age 5 years ', ' 5 years of age ', ' 5 year old ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' cognitive testing ', ' life-long learning ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' outcome prediction ', ' connectome ', ' high dimensionality ', ' artificial neural network ', ' ']",NICHD,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,R21,2018,198750,OH-01,0.10790525726472779
"Obesity Prevention in Early Life (OPEL): Risk Screening and Targeted Intervention Given the difficulty of reversing obesity once present, there has been increasing focus on the primary prevention of obesity early in the lifecourse. Few attempts have been made to prevent obesity during the first years of life. This proposal summarizes a 5-year program of mentored professional development tied to a multi-method research project intended to improve the identification and potential treatment of infants and toddlers with high risk for obesity. My long-term goal is to prevent obesity by identifying infants at greatest risk and providing for them an effective, family-centered intervention that targets modifiable, life course factors. My central hypothesis, based on my prior research, is that identifying infants at risk for obesity prior to the onset of unhealthy weight gain will enable early intervention. My research plan aims to: (1) create risk prediction models for obesity at age 24 months by linking three existing data systems that combine birth certificate, contextual- level, and health outcome data; (2) test the feasibility of linking these data prospectively to validate the Aim 1 obesity risk prediction models over a 24-month period within a contemporary, clinical cohort; and (3) identify best approaches for family-focused risk communication regarding the prevention of excessive weight gain and obesity in infants and toddlers using a human-centered design approach. Through my career development plan and guidance from my mentors, I will expand upon a foundation in epidemiology and pediatric health services research to develop expertise in machine learning, health informatics, data integration, qualitative methods, human-centered design, and behavior change. Together, the research and educational aims of this proposal will provide me with the necessary groundwork to compete for additional funding as an independent investigator. Specifically, I will seek R03-level grant funding from the NIDDK in year 4 of my K01 award to test the communication strategy developed in Aim 3 and to partner with families to modify an existing behavioral change intervention for use in infancy. By the end of this award, I will be well positioned to apply for funding from the NIDDK to conduct a robust R01-level study that combines the validated prediction models, family- focused communication strategy, and modified intervention to determine whether we can effectively prevent obesity in those infants and toddlers identified as being at the highest risk. This line of research will help ensure that prevention efforts are deployed in an efficient, cost-effective manner and accepted by those who need them. I will accomplish this work under the mentorship of Dr. Aaron E. Carroll, a child health services researcher, and a multidisciplinary team of faculty with expertise machine learning, health informatics, data integration and surveillance, qualitative research, human-centered design approaches, behavior change, and childhood obesity. I am ideally suited to complete this research due to my past research productivity, current mentorship team, open access to health care data, and the established clinical decision support infrastructure at the Indiana University School of Medicine. ! Project Narrative Increasing evidence suggests that the infancy and toddler periods represent the best opportunity for obesity prevention, but few attempts have been made to prevent obesity during the first years of life. The current proposal seeks to develop practical methods to assess the risk of future obesity in infants and toddlers in the clinical setting, and to partner with families to explore new ways to communicate early life obesity risk in ways that account for their perceptions, concerns and beliefs. This proposal has the promise to lead to targeted, tailored interventions for infants most at-risk for obesity, ensuring that prevention efforts are deployed in an efficient, cost-effective manner and

"Cerebral Palsy Risk Identification System PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT [ Pediatric specialists are often required to identify infants who are likely to suffer poor neurodevelopmental outcome, including Cerebral Palsy (CP). CP is the most common developmental disability among children in the United States and results from several factors, including low weight for gestational age, premature birth, and stroke. Although MRI and cranial ultrasound (cUS) provide valuable structural information in the preterm period, they have moderate sensitivity to CP and require transportation of the infant. Over the past 20 years, numerous studies have validated the clinical potential of General Movement Assessment (GMA) for CP risk identification. During the early period, (23 weeks to 36 weeks gestational age), the presence of Cramped Synchronized General Movements (CSGMs), has demonstrated very high sensitivity and specificity for CP, conjointly ranging from 80%-98%. CSGMs are assessed while preterm infants are still in an acute care facility (NICU) and can inform the clinician independently, and in combination with cUS and MRI. Despite its potential, GMA is available in only a few clinical centers, as adoption and routine application depend on lengthy, cost-intensive observation and availability of specially trained raters. A Cerebral Palsy Risk Identification System (CPRIS) is proposed that will automate GMA for bedside evaluations in both preterm and postterm periods. The CPRIS constitutes a key enabling technology not only for routine risk identification, but also for establishing disease trajectory and potentially differentiating CP subtypes and assessing efficacy of emerging treatments along the early developmental continuum.  Preliminary studies at UC Irvine have demonstrated that GMA analysis for CSGMs can be automated by quantifying infant limb movement using highly miniaturized, 3-axis wireless accelerometers and classifying CSGMs using a patented Markov-type approach that merges an application-specific Erlang-Cox state transition model with a Dynamic Bayesian Network (“EC-DBN”), treating instantaneous machine learning classification values as observations and explicitly modeling CSGM (and non-CSGM) duration and interval. In Phase I, this approach will be utilized in a comparative evaluation of two movement measurement modalities to determine which has the best overall performance and clinical utility at three leading NICU centers. Infant movement data will be concurrently acquired using an advanced, second generation prototype wireless accelerometer system (CPRIS-A) and a high definition 3D (infrared) optical camera (CPRIS-O). The optical modality offers significant potential advantages as it requires no infant contact and can monitor unattended, intermittently, over weeks or months. However, its potential for GMA automation must be systematically evaluated. Classifier results from both modalities will be compared to expert rater consensus in 80 preterm infants. The primary outcome will be CSGM identification accuracy, as determined by ROC-AUC analyses, with a threshold for success of 0.85. Additional comparative performance measures include reliability and practicability in the NICU environment. An Advisory Committee of experts in the fields of neonatology, pediatrics and cerebral palsy will evaluate project results and advise on the clinical potential of each modality. ] PROJECT NARRATIVE Cerebral palsy is the most common physical disability in childhood, with a prevalence of 2.1 cases per 1000 in high-income countries. The overall project goal is to develop a computerized hardware-software system capable of identifying preterm infants at high risk of developing cerebral palsy (CP), based on the systematic identification of specific patterns of movement-derived features. The Cerebral Palsy Risk Identification System (CPRIS) will enable clinical staff with only minimal training to cost effectively implement General Movement Assessment (GMA) for Cramped Synchronous General Movements (CSGMs), with interpretive reporting performed automatically. The CPRIS constitutes a key enabling technology for advancement in the identification, characterization and treatment assessment of CP.",Cerebral Palsy Risk Identification

"Structural Development of Human Fetal Brain Abstract Despite its critical significance, little is known about the most dynamic phase of brain development in infancy: 0-2 years. To change the status quo, comprehensive and quantitative infant brain atlases as reference standards for precision health are needed. In addition, diffusion MRI (dMRI) has entered a new era in which dynamic cortical internal microstructural complexity, indexed by e.g. cortical mean kurtosis derived from diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI), can be studied in the living infant brain noninvasively using more advanced multi-shell dMRI. Furthermore, multi-modality measures offer unparalleled insights into mechanistic structure- function and structure-behavior relationships. Work in the current cycle has focused on structural development of human fetal and preterm brains. Based on high resolution diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of 150 brains, we have established the atlases and quantified cortical microstructure with cortical fractional anisotropy, validated by histological images and correlated with transcriptomic (RNA) expression. Building upon this work, in the next cycle, we will focus on brain development in infancy, immediately after the fetal period. Specifically, the goal is to establish next-generation dMRI atlases (quantitative UPenn-CHOP infant brain atlases) and to harness a more advanced cortical microstructural mean kurtosis measurement by delineating its 4D spatiotemporal frameworks as well as uncovering its relationship to brain function and behavior during infancy (0-2 years). 160 typically developing infants at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 months will be recruited. Advanced “connectome-quality” multi-band high-resolution multi-shell dMRI, resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) and structural MRI will be acquired. High-quality whole-head magnetoencephalography (MEG) will also be acquired. Anatomical labels of all 122 major gray and white matter structures will be built up based on high contrasts from DTI-derived maps. The measurements of DTI-derived metrics will be used for the quantitative components of DTI atlases and age-dependent white matter tract trajectories (Aim 1). Mean kurtosis of the 4th order kurtosis tensor has been shown to be sensitive to cortical internal microstructural changes of infant brains. The spatiotemporal sensitivity of mean kurtosis measures to infant age and cortical region will be investigated (Aim 2). Furthermore, we will establish mechanistic structure-function relationships with multi- modality imaging, including not only multi-shell dMRI, but also rs-fMRI and MEG, all optimized for infant brains (Aim 3). The quantitative infant brain atlases and normal developmental trajectories will provide reference standards for “pre-“diagnostic risk assessment, filling a gap towards precision health for infants (e.g. Z-score maps). Infant cortical microstructure will be delineated noninvasively with 4D spatiotemporal frameworks. With multi-modality strength, the fundamental structure-function and structure-behavior mechanistic relations will set the stage for understanding aberrant brain development in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autistic spectrum disorder and intellectual disabilities in general.

"Effects of prenatal cocaine on early brain functional connectivity and behavior ABSTRACT Prenatal cocaine exposure (PCE) is consistently related to impaired attention and behavioral and physiological self-regulation in infants and young children, suggesting persistent negative impact on skills essential for optimal learning and social competence. Gestational exposure to cocaine occurs during a time of extraordinary brain growth and organization, which is immediately followed by massive expansion and refinement of brain structure, functional connections and network organization in the first year of life. However, little is known about the effects of PCE on early human brain development that may contribute to reported deficits in cognition and neurobehavior. The objectives of this proposal are to quantify the effects of PCE on the developmental trajectory of infant brain functional connectivity in postnatal months 0-12, to determine associations with neurobehavioral and cognitive outcomes, and to examine how specific maternal caregiving characteristics (Sensitivity, Harshness) moderate these effects. Our central hypothesis is that fetal brain development and organization are altered by PCE; deficits in developing functional connections mediate the negative effects of PCE on simultaneously developing neurobehavior and early cognition; postnatal maternal behaviors and environment interact with PCE to influence growth trajectories of developing connections and networks that subserve emerging abilities. This hypothesis is based on the Co-PIs'strong preliminary data describing normative development of functional networks from birth to 2 years (Gao), disruptions in functional connectivity due to prenatal cocaine and other drugs in neonates (Grewen, Gao), and on Co-investigator Eiden's longitudinal studies of the behavioral effects of PCE and its moderation by maternal behaviors in infants, toddlers and children. We propose to study infant resting state functional connectivity and behavioral development at 2 weeks, 6 months and 12 months in 3 groups of infants: 120 with PCE with or without exposure to other drugs (nicotine, alcohol, marijuana, and/or opiates), 100 exposed to the same other drugs but without cocaine (OD), 100 drug-free (CTL). We will measure Maternal Sensitivity (primary), Maternal Harshness (secondary) and an index of cumulative environmental risk to determine postnatal moderation of PCE effects on developing connectivity. The rationale is that longitudinal study will reveal prenatal drug effects, determine whether the postnatal trajectory of brain functional connections is merely delayed or permanently altered by initial PCE insult, and ascertain postnatal factors contributing to greater risk or resilience in func- tional network development. This innovative approach will quantify direct and interactive effects of initial neural deficit and postnatal environmental influences on patterns of brain and cognitive development, and will apply hypothesis-driven and data-driven analytic methods, including machine learning, to characterize mechanisms underlying PCE effects on trajectory of brain development. Knowledge gleaned has potential to inform earlier, more effective interventions to prevent or reduce learning and behavioral impairments in this at-risk population. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will provide currently unavailable knowledge of the effects of prenatal cocaine and other drug exposures on developing brain functional connections and networks that subserve emerging behaviors and cognition in the first year of life, and will shed light on modifiable postnatal factors that may enhance or further impair early brain development. It is relevant to public health because discovery of mechanisms by which prenatal cocaine exposure influences development of brain and cognition in infancy will lead to earlier, more effective interventions to prevent or reduce later disabilities, as opposed to treatment in later childhood. This research is relevant to the mission of NIDA because it seeks to identify the physiological and social substrates and mechanisms involved in the cognitive and behavioral effects produced by drugs of abuse in an exceptionally vulnerable population— infants exposed in utero.",Effects of prenatal cocaine on early brain functional connectivity and behavior,9538116,R01DA042988,"['Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdala ', ' Animals ', ' Arousal ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Cocaine ', ' Cognition ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Environment ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' indexing ', ' Infant ', ' Insula of Reil ', ' Island of Reil ', ' Insula ', ' Central Lobe ', ' Learning ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Marijuana ', ' marihuana ', ' Maternal Behavior ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' working memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Mothers ', ' Nicotine ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Rest ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Testing ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' thalamic ', ' Thalamus ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Glean ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' ventral tegmentum ', ' Ventral Tegmental Area ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' Lateral ', ' Anterior ', ' Dorsal ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' intraparietal sulcus ', ' disability ', ' infantile ', ' infancy ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Opiates ', ' Opioid ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Exposure to ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Parietal ', ' postnatal ', ' Pattern ', ' fetal ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' cingulate cortex ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Structure ', ' prenatal ', ' unborn ', ' Fetal Cocaine Exposure ', ' prenatally cocaine exposed ', ' prenatal cocaine exposure ', ' gestational cocaine exposure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Toddler ', ' social skills ', ' social competency ', ' social competence ', ' interpersonal competency ', ' interpersonal competence ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Drug Exposure ', ' prenatal exposure ', ' prenatally exposed ', ' intrauterine environmental exposure ', ' intra-uterine environmental exposure ', ' in utero exposure ', ' fetal exposure ', ' exposed in utero ', ' response ', ' neurobehavior ', ' executive function ', ' executive control ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Future Generations ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Data ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' Cognitive ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' neonate ', ' neurobehavioral ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' drugs of abuse ', ' drugs abused ', ' drug abused ', ' abused drugs ', ' abused drug ', ' drug of abuse ', ' impaired behavior ', ' behavioral impairment ', ' effective intervention ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' exposure to cocaine ', ' exposed to cocaine ', ' cocaine-exposed ', ' cocaine exposure ', ' learning competence ', ' learning achievement ', ' learning ability ', ' cognitive development ', ' cognitive ability ', ' behavior study ', ' behavioral study ', ' maternal care giving ', ' maternal caregiving ', ' neonatal brain ', ' gender-associated difference ', ' gender difference ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2018,679633,NC-04,0.10935257254805393
"A Longitudinal MRI Study Characterizing Very Early Brain Development in Infants with Down Syndrome Longitudinal MRI Characterization of Very Early Brain Development  in Infants with Down Syndrome Project Summary/Abstract Down syndrome (DS), the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability, is associated with varying degrees of cognitive and behavioral impairments. Pharmacologic therapies and genetic modulators are emerging which, if administered early in conjunction with traditional therapies, show promise for improving developmental outcomes in children with DS. However, the stark absence of early neurodevelopment knowledge in DS hampers these efforts. The main goal of this proposal is to develop biomarkers as future targets for specific therapies based on careful characterization of early aberrant neurodevelopmental patterns. This study will be a combined effort with WU as the coordinating center and six other research groups: UNC, UW, CHOP, MNI, NYU, and University of Minnesota. These groups comprise the ACE-IBIS (Autism Center of Excellence Infant Brain Imaging Study) network, a well-established and experienced group that has been productively collaborating for 8 years on MRI imaging and behavioral characterization of infants at high risk for autism, healthy typical infants (TYP), and infants with Fragile X. The aims of this proposal are: 1) Define the longitudinal characteristics of early brain development in infants (3 to 24 months) with DS in comparison to TYP infants and infants with other developmental disabilities (ASD and Fragile X) using three different types of neuroimaging (MRI, DTI, rsfMRI); 2) Develop predictive models for developmental outcomes in infants with DS based on longitudinal structural or functional MRI characteristics; and 3) Characterize brain-behavior correlates with coordinated multimodal imaging in infancy characterizing the interrelationship between longitudinal network imaging parameters and cognitive, behavioral and neurodevelopmental outcomes using sophisticated multivariate support vector machine (SVM) analytic strategies. 120 infants with DS and 40 TYP control infants will be followed longitudinally from 3 to 24 months. MRI scans will be obtained during natural sleep and a series of well-validated developmental and behavioral assessments will be completed at each visit. This project will be the first to define the nature and timing of alterations in brain development in infants with DS. The proposed project addresses several key research recommendations from the “NICHD 2014-The NIH Research Plan on Down Syndrome.” The study aims match the recommendation for the quantitative characterization based on imaging of early brain development and the relationship of cognitive, behavioral and social development to early aberrant neurodevelopment in DS. This project will also address recommendations for investigation of comorbid ASD in DS, which could be as high as 5-10%. The IBIS network is uniquely qualified to examine early neurodevelopmental patterns, utilizing the ASD, TYP and FraX infant data sets to better characterize and examine specificity of DS early developmental patterns including ASD qualities and impairments in social development. It is clear that quantification of neurodevelopmental trajectories in infants with DS will be critical to identification of personalized intervention strategies and to assess the efficacy of early life, targeted, highly novel and mechanistically specific DS interventions. Project Narrative Down's syndrome (DS), the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability, is associated with a wide range of cognitive and behavioral impairments. Through the use of cutting edge MRI technology that allows us to look at the shape, function, and connections within the brain, we will be able to study and better understand early brain development in infants with DS. Working toward the goal to be able to assess the impact of specific early intervention therapies that are most helpful in improving the developmental outcomes of children with DS. This study mirrors and expands on the study designs and techniques that were developed to study infants with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), Fragile X, and typically developing infants, and will allow us to further our understanding of maturation patterns of infant brains that we can apply to DS, ASD, Fragile X, and other disabilities.",A Longitudinal MRI Study Characterizing Very Early Brain

"Role of short chain fatty acids in intestinal barrier maturation in preterm infants PROJECT SUMMARY Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a life-threatening, gastrointestinal (GI) emergency affecting 7-10% of preterm infants with mortality as high as 30-50%. ""Leaky gut"", or intestinal barrier immaturity with elevated intestinal permeability (IP), is the proximate cause of susceptibility to NEC in preterm neonates. Early detection of leaky gut is essential to identify infants at risk for NEC to prevent and reduce disease severity. No clinical factor, routine laboratory test or biomarker alone or in combination have been described that identify preterm neonates with impaired intestinal barrier function who at increased risk for NEC. The goal of this study is to develop a rapid, non-invasive screening tool to identify “at-risk"" preterm infants prior to the onset of NEC. We recently revealed rapid maturation of the intestinal barrier is strongly associated with clinical factors such as early breastmilk feeding, less antibiotic exposure and later post-menstrual age, and significantly higher abundance and metabolic activities of Clostridiales and Bifidobacterium. Although the butyrate producing Clostridiales have been implicated in strengthening the intestinal epithelial barrier and reducing intestinal inflammation, it is unknown whether butyrate and potentially other short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are associated with neonatal intestinal barrier maturation. Our preliminary data revealed butyrate production pathways, in particular Pyruvate/Acetyl-CoA pathway are significantly more abundant in low IP subjects. In this study, we propose to validate a substantiated measure of fecal microbial and/or metabolic biomarkers combined with associated neonatal factors for a rapid, non-invasive screening test. We postulate that the level(s) of metabolic activities, particularly butyrate production and potentially other SCFAs via increased colonization of Clostridiales and Bifidobacterium, are associated with intestinal barrier maturation in preterm neonates. To address our hypothesis, we will leverage existed stool samples collected from a cohort of ~200 preterms (<33 weeks), for whom both microbiota (16S rRNA gene sequencing) and IP (urine non-metabolized sugar probes lactulose and rhamnose) are available, and propose 2 aims: 1) to determine fecal metabolic activities associated with intestinal barrier maturation in preterm neonates <33 weeks gestation; and 2) to identify and characterize butyrate-producing bacteria associated with intestinal permeability in preterm neonates during the first 7-10 days of life. At the completion of the study, we will determine the biomarkers associated with healthy intestinal barrier functions and the discriminatory scheme for accurate classification of high or low IP group. Our long-term goal is to conduct a randomize clinical trial of rationally designed intervention for NEC early prevention. Refinement of the screening tool will identify infants with aberrant leaky gut, an essential prerequisite for subsequent rational design of novel strategies such as clinical trials of probiotics to promote healthy intestinal barrier functions to reduce NEC incidence. PROJECT NARRATIVE ""Leaky gut"", is the proximate cause of susceptibility to necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), a life-threatening, gastrointestinal emergency affecting 7-10% of preterm infants with mortality as high as 30-50%. This proposal will develop and validate a rapid, non-invasive screening test incorporating microbiome-based markers and associated neonatal factors, to identify “at-risk"" preterm infants prior to the onset of NEC. The results of this study will support clinical trials aimed to optimize intestinal maturation and to reduce the burden of NEC complications. This study will address major knowledge gaps of the intestinal microenvironment in preterm infants, and ultimately lead to improved strategies to manage neonatal gastrointestinal health, improve children’s health and quality of life, all which are within the mission of NIDDK.",Role of short chain fatty acids in intestinal barrier maturation in preterm infants,9872417,R21DK123674,"['Acetyl

"Obesity Prevention in Early Life (OPEL): Risk Screening and Targeted Intervention Given the difficulty of reversing obesity once present, there has been increasing focus on the primary prevention of obesity early in the lifecourse. Few attempts have been made to prevent obesity during the first years of life. This proposal summarizes a 5-year program of mentored professional development tied to a multi-method research project intended to improve the identification and potential treatment of infants and toddlers with high risk for obesity. My long-term goal is to prevent obesity by identifying infants at greatest risk and providing for them an effective, family-centered intervention that targets modifiable, life course factors. My central hypothesis, based on my prior research, is that identifying infants at risk for obesity prior to the onset of unhealthy weight gain will enable early intervention. My research plan aims to: (1) create risk prediction models for obesity at age 24 months by linking three existing data systems that combine birth certificate, contextual- level, and health outcome data; (2) test the feasibility of linking these data prospectively to validate the Aim 1 obesity risk prediction models over a 24-month period within a contemporary, clinical cohort; and (3) identify best approaches for family-focused risk communication regarding the prevention of excessive weight gain and obesity in infants and toddlers using a human-centered design approach. Through my career development plan and guidance from my mentors, I will expand upon a foundation in epidemiology and pediatric health services research to develop expertise in machine learning, health informatics, data integration, qualitative methods, human-centered design, and behavior change. Together, the research and educational aims of this proposal will provide me with the necessary groundwork to compete for additional funding as an independent investigator. Specifically, I will seek R03-level grant funding from the NIDDK in year 4 of my K01 award to test the communication strategy developed in Aim 3 and to partner with families to modify an existing behavioral change intervention for use in infancy. By the end of this award, I will be well positioned to apply for funding from the NIDDK to conduct a robust R01-level study that combines the validated prediction models, family- focused communication strategy, and modified intervention to determine whether we can effectively prevent obesity in those infants and toddlers identified as being at the highest risk. This line of research will help ensure that prevention efforts are deployed in an efficient, cost-effective manner and accepted by those who need them. I will accomplish this work under the mentorship of Dr. Aaron E. Carroll, a child health services researcher, and a multidisciplinary team of faculty with expertise machine learning, health informatics, data integration and surveillance, qualitative research, human-centered design approaches, behavior change, and childhood obesity. I am ideally suited to complete this research due to my past research productivity, current mentorship team, open access to health care data, and the established clinical decision support infrastructure at the Indiana University School of Medicine. ! Project Narrative Increasing evidence suggests that the infancy and toddler periods represent the best opportunity for obesity prevention, but few attempts have been made to prevent obesity during the first years of life. The current proposal seeks to develop practical methods to assess the risk of future obesity in infants and toddlers in the clinical setting, and to partner with families to explore new ways to communicate early life obesity risk in ways that account for their perceptions, concerns and beliefs. This proposal has the promise to lead to targeted, tailored interventions for infants most at-risk for obesity, ensuring that prevention efforts are deployed in an efficient, cost-effective manner and

"Early Prediction of Cognitive Deficits in Very Preterm Infants using Machine Learning and Brain Connectome Project Summary/Abstract The high risk of neurodevelopmental impairments is a major concern for parents and clinicians caring for premature babies. Annually, approximately 22,000 very preterm infants (i.e. ≤32 weeks gestational age) in the United States develop cognitive deficits. Efforts to target interventions to prevent neurodevelopmental sequelae are hampered by our current inability to diagnose disabilities before the age of 3 to 5 years. Research supports the notion that cognitive deficits may result from a perturbation of neural connection and communication. Recent brain connectome studies in adults and older children show that abnormal network properties are useful as prognostic biomarkers. Many of these studies have exploited machine learning models based on brain connectome data for the prediction of a variety of neurological conditions, however this progress has not been fully extended to the preterm population. Our preliminary studies suggest that early and accurate prediction of cognitive deficits at an individual level is possible using machine learning models based on brain connectome features at term corrected age (CA). We have correctly classified 91.3% of very preterm infants at high risk of cognitive deficits with 90% specificity and 92.3% sensitivity. Our overall objective is to develop a robust machine learning model that can analyze integrated structural and functional brain connectome data obtained at term CA to make a prediction of later cognitive deficits in very preterm infants. Our central hypothesis is that machine learning techniques analyzing integrated structural and functional brain connectome features at birth can predict cognitive deficits at 2 years CA at an individual level in very preterm infants with accuracy of greater than 90%, exceeding the performance of current classical multivariate analyses. The two specific aims to test the central hypothesis are: 1) Develop and implement a machine learning model to extract high-level brain connectome features and 2) Develop and validate a machine learning framework to predict cognitive deficits. On completion of the first aim, we will explicate the brain connectome, and extract high-dimensional connectome features that best represent the brain connectome. In the second aim, the machine learning model we proposed will be applied in predicting both cognitive deficit (i.e. 2-class classification) and cognitive scores on a continuous scale (i.e., regression) at 2 years CA. To quantify the model's discrimination, we will also validate its performance in data that are not used for the model development, and compare with the current conventional multivariate approach. The proposed research is significant because it will increase scientific knowledge about the developing brain connectome in very preterm infants and facilitate earlier identification of babies at high risk of neurodevelopmental deficits, allowing timely clinical interventions for optimal cognitive outcome. Project Narrative Babies born before 32 weeks' gestational age are at a very high risk of developing cognitive deficits, which may impact their brain function in many ways, including life-long learning difficulties. Fortunately, infant brains are highly malleable, so it is important to identify those at highest risk as early as possible to allow effective early interventions. We propose to apply a reliable, accurate and sensitive artificial intelligence approach based on state-of-the-art brain MRI to allow identification of babies at highest risk of learning difficulties.",Early Prediction of Cognitive Deficits in Very Preterm Infants using Machine Learning and Brain Connectome,9759972,R21HD094085,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' childrearing ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' Parenting ', ' Child Rearing ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Communication ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Exhibits ', ' Fetal Age ', ' Chronologic Fetal Maturity ', ' Gestational Age ', ' Goals ', "" Children's Hospital "", ' Pediatric Hospitals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Infant ', ' preterm neonate ', ' preterm infant human ', ' preterm infant ', ' preterm baby ', ' premature infant human ', ' premature baby ', ' infants born prematurely ', ' infants born premature ', ' Premature Infant ', ' Learning ', ' infant ALL ', ' Pediatric Acute Lymphoid Leukemia ', ' Pediatric Acute Lymphogenous Leukemia ', ' Pediatric Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia ', ' Pediatric Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia ', ' Pediatric ALL ', ' Lymphoblastic Leukemia, Acute, L1 ', ' L1 Lymphocytic Leukemia ', ' Childhood Acute Lymphoid Leukemia ', ' Childhood Acute Lymphogenous Leukemia ', ' Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia ', ' Childhood ALL ', ' Childhood Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Multivariate Analyses ', ' Multivariate Analysis ', ' neuroplasticity ', ' neuroplastic ', ' neural plasticity ', ' CNS plasticity ', ' Neuronal Plasticity ', ' Parents ', ' Physiology ', ' Research ', ' Research Support ', ' Rest ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' medical complication ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Funding ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' high risk infant ', ' vulnerable infant ', ' Scanning ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Neurologic Deficit ', ' interest ', ' Performance ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Neural Development ', ' Structure ', ' Cognitive deficits ', ' cognitive defects ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' social ', ' Early identification ', ' Modeling ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Property ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' model development ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' dMRI ', ' Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Diffusion weighted imaging ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' DWI-MRI ', ' DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) ', ' Institution ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' Prognostic Marker ', ' prognostic indicator ', ' prognostic biomarker ', ' Prognosis Marker ', ' Molecular Marker of Prognosis ', ' Cognitive ', ' Validation ', ' sex ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' neonate ', ' Neurodevelopmental Deficit ', ' Neurodevelopmental Impairment ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' Outcome ', ' Neonatal ', ' Population ', ' Mind ', ' 5 year old ', ' five years of age ', ' five year old ', ' age 5 years ', ' 5 years of age ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' life-long learning ', ' lifelong learning ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' connectome ', ' high dimensionality ', ' artificial neural network ', ' synthetic neural network ', ' computational neural network ', ' artificial neural net ', ' autoencoder ', ' autoencoding neural network ', ' connectome data ', ' connectomic data ', ' ']",NICHD,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,R21,2019,238500,OH-01,0.10790525726472779
"Effects of prenatal cocaine on early brain functional connectivity and behavior ABSTRACT Prenatal cocaine exposure (PCE) is consistently related to impaired attention and behavioral and physiological self-regulation in infants and young children, suggesting persistent negative impact on skills essential for optimal learning and social competence. Gestational exposure to cocaine occurs during a time of extraordinary brain growth and organization, which is immediately followed by massive expansion and refinement of brain structure, functional connections and network organization in the first year of life. However, little is known about the effects of PCE on early human brain development that may contribute to reported deficits in cognition and neurobehavior. The objectives of this proposal are to quantify the effects of PCE on the developmental trajectory of infant brain functional connectivity in postnatal months 0-12, to determine associations with neurobehavioral and cognitive outcomes, and to examine how specific maternal caregiving characteristics (Sensitivity, Harshness) moderate these effects. Our central hypothesis is that fetal brain development and organization are altered by PCE; deficits in developing functional connections mediate the negative effects of PCE on simultaneously developing neurobehavior and early cognition; postnatal maternal behaviors and environment interact with PCE to influence growth trajectories of developing connections and networks that subserve emerging abilities. This hypothesis is based on the Co-PIs'strong preliminary data describing normative development of functional networks from birth to 2 years (Gao), disruptions in functional connectivity due to prenatal cocaine and other drugs in neonates (Grewen, Gao), and on Co-investigator Eiden's longitudinal studies of the behavioral effects of PCE and its moderation by maternal behaviors in infants, toddlers and children. We propose to study infant resting state functional connectivity and behavioral development at 2 weeks, 6 months and 12 months in 3 groups of infants: 120 with PCE with or without exposure to other drugs (nicotine, alcohol, marijuana, and/or opiates), 100 exposed to the same other drugs but without cocaine (OD), 100 drug-free (CTL). We will measure Maternal Sensitivity (primary), Maternal Harshness (secondary) and an index of cumulative environmental risk to determine postnatal moderation of PCE effects on developing connectivity. The rationale is that longitudinal study will reveal prenatal drug effects, determine whether the postnatal trajectory of brain functional connections is merely delayed or permanently altered by initial PCE insult, and ascertain postnatal factors contributing to greater risk or resilience in func- tional network development. This innovative approach will quantify direct and interactive effects of initial neural deficit and postnatal environmental influences on patterns of brain and cognitive development, and will apply hypothesis-driven and data-driven analytic methods, including machine learning, to characterize mechanisms underlying PCE effects on trajectory of brain development. Knowledge gleaned has potential to inform earlier, more effective interventions to prevent or reduce learning and behavioral impairments in this at-risk population. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will provide currently unavailable knowledge of the effects of prenatal cocaine and other drug exposures on developing brain functional connections and networks that subserve emerging behaviors and cognition in the first year of life, and will shed light on modifiable postnatal factors that may enhance or further impair early brain development. It is relevant to public health because discovery of mechanisms by which prenatal cocaine exposure influences development of brain and cognition in infancy will lead to earlier, more effective interventions to prevent or reduce later disabilities, as opposed to treatment in later childhood. This research is relevant to the mission of NIDA because it seeks to identify the physiological and social substrates and mechanisms involved in the cognitive and behavioral effects produced by drugs of abuse in an exceptionally vulnerable population— infants exposed in utero.",Effects of prenatal cocaine on early brain functional connectivity and behavior,9747247,R01DA042988,"['Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdala ', ' Animals ', ' Arousal ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Cocaine ', ' Cognition ', ' Conflict ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Environment ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' indexing ', ' Infant ', ' Island of Reil ', ' Insula ', ' Central Lobe ', ' Insula of Reil ', ' Learning ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' longterm study ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' marihuana ', ' Marijuana ', ' Maternal Behavior ', ' working memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Mothers ', ' Nicotine ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Rest ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Testing ', ' thalamic ', ' Thalamus ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Glean ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' Ventral Tegmental Area ', ' ventral tegmentum ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' Lateral ', ' Anterior ', ' Dorsal ', ' Biological ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' intraparietal sulcus ', ' disability ', ' infancy ', ' infantile ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Opioid ', ' Opiates ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Exposure to ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Parietal ', ' postnatal ', ' Pattern ', ' fetal ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' cingulate cortex ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Structure ', ' prenatal ', ' unborn ', ' Fetal Cocaine Exposure ', ' prenatally cocaine exposed ', ' prenatal cocaine exposure ', ' gestational cocaine exposure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Toddler ', ' social skills ', ' social competency ', ' social competence ', ' interpersonal competency ', ' interpersonal competence ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Drug Exposure ', ' prenatal exposure ', ' prenatally exposed ', ' intrauterine environmental exposure ', ' intra-uterine environmental exposure ', ' in utero exposure ', ' fetal exposure ', ' exposed in utero ', ' response ', ' neurobehavior ', ' executive function ', ' executive control ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Future Generations ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' Cognitive ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' neonate ', ' neurobehavioral ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Impairment ', ' drug of abuse ', ' drugs of abuse ', ' drugs abused ', ' drug abused ', ' abused drugs ', ' abused drug ', ' behavioral impairment ', ' impaired behavior ', ' effective intervention ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' cocaine exposure ', ' exposure to cocaine ', ' exposed to cocaine ', ' cocaine-exposed ', ' learning ability ', ' learning competence ', ' learning achievement ', ' cognitive development ', ' cognitive ability ', ' behavioral study ', ' behavior study ', ' maternal caregiving ', ' maternal care giving ', ' neonatal brain ', ' gender difference ', ' gender-associated difference ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2019,682492,NC-04,0.10935257254805393
"Decoding the neural time-course of spoken word recognition Project Summary  Word recognition is crucial not only for comprehending spoken language but for mapping spoken words onto text in reading. Individuals with language and reading deficits (e.g., Specific Language Impairment, Dyslexia, Autism, which together affect up to 16% of children) have been shown to have deficits in word recognition, making it crucial to understand this process. A hallmark of word recognition is that listeners activate neural representations of multiple candidate words that are consistent with the early acoustic input, and these candidates compete for recognition as they unfold in real-time.  The overall goal of this proposal is to capitalize on recent developments in multivariate and machine- learning techniques for analyzing signals obtained from the human brain to measure the real-time unfolding of spoken word recognition. Although these techniques have been most widely used with fMRI data, we propose to extend them to EEG data because EEG is easily used with children and clinical populations, and provides access to the time-course of word recognition, thereby revealing underlying cognitive mechanisms of word recognition, such as lexical competition. Our preliminary findings using this EEG-based paradigm have demonstrated that we can decode the recognition of a specific word (among a set of 8-12 alternatives) at each msec time-step after stimulus onset. The method is sensitive to partial activation of competing words that share some phonological features with the target word, thereby revealing the dynamics of lexical competition as the word-recognition system settles on the final target.  Our objectives are to conduct a series of small-scale experiments that achieve three aims. First, we develop and optimize the method with adults (e.g., the experimental procedure and computational implementation). Second, we validate the method with adults by measuring its test/re-test reliability, comparing its estimates of word recognition with traditional behavioral paradigms, and examining how lexical status, and semantic and orthographic expectations shape lexical competition revealed by the EEG measure. This will yield a new, non-invasive, and highly reliable method suitable for assessing spoken word recognition in adults, children, and special populations. Third, we will preliminarily extend the method to children to pave the way for future developmental studies. Taken together, accomplishing these three aims would provide an innovative and powerful tool for assessing a crucial component of language processing in a wide variety of typical and atypical populations. Project Narrative The proposed research will impact public health by establishing a new EEG-based paradigm for understanding how listeners recognize spoken words. Word recognition is crucial not only for comprehending spoken language but for mapping spoken words onto text in reading. Individuals with language and reading deficits (e.g., Specific Language Impairment, Dyslexia, Autism, which together affect up to 16% of children) have been shown to have deficits in word recognition, making it crucial to understand this process.

Our project will develop and optimize a new method in which machine learning tools are used to decode EEG-based neural signals to characterize the time-course of competition. Such a method offers the prospect of a diagnostic tool to identify young children who are at risk for communication disorders.",Decoding the neural time-course of spoken word recognition,9650473,R21DC017596,"['Acoustics ', ' Acoustic ', ' Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Candy ', ' Confection ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Cochlear Prosthesis ', ' Cochlear Implants ', ' Communicative Disorders ', ' Communication Disorders ', ' Communication impairment ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Implanted Electrodes ', ' EEG ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' epileptogenic ', ' epileptiform ', ' epilepsia ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' Epileptics ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Eye Movements ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Hearing ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' indexing ', ' Language ', ' Developmental Language Disorders ', ' Developmental Disorder Speech or Language ', ' Language Development Disorders ', ' language deficit ', ' Language disability ', ' Language Disorders ', ' Literature ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Public Health ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Semantics ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Surface ', ' Clinical ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Electrocorticogram ', ' electrocorticography ', ' millisecond ', ' Msec ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' specific language impairment ', ' Dyslexia ', ' Word Blindness ', ' Visual attention ', ' named group ', ' Special Population ', ' phonology ', ' behavior measurement ', ' behavioral measurement ', ' behavioral measure ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' neurotransmission ', ' neuronal signaling ', ' neural signaling ', ' nerve signaling ', ' glial signaling ', ' glia signaling ', ' axonal signaling ', ' axon-glial signaling ', ' axon signaling ', ' Neuronal Transmission ', ' Nerve Transmission ', ' Nerve Impulse Transmission ', ' expectation ', ' Participant ', ' response ', ' Orthography ', ' oculomotor ', ' ocularmotor ', ' ocular motor ', ' Address ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' autistic spectrum disorder ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' Infantile Autism ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Autism ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Instruction ', ' Behavioral Paradigm ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Impairment ', ' language processing ', ' lexical processing ', ' lexical ', ' reading difficulties ', ' reading deficit ', ' reading deficiency ', ' behavioral response ', ' behavior response ', ' attentional control ', ' temporal measurement ', ' time measurement ', ' temporal resolution ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' ']",NIDCD,"HASKINS LABORATORIES, INC.",R21,2019,277714,CT-03,-0.03494632820705961
"Human Newborn Energy Homeostasis Brain Networks And Infant Adiposity This revised application, submitted in response to NIH PA-18-741 “Secondary Analyses in Obesity,  Diabetes, and Digestive and Kidney Diseases,” relates to the public health problem of childhood  obesity, with a specific focus on the characterization, determinants and role of energy balance  homeostasis-related brain circuitry in the human newborn. The proposal describes a comprehensive  plan designed to advance neonatal MRI analytical methods, developmental systems neuroscience, and  fetal programming of health and disease risk. The critical importance of the  hypothalamic-limbic-cortical brain circuitry that regulates energy homeostasis is well  established, and MRI-based measures of energy homeostasis-related brain circuits have been  associated with obesity outcomes. However, it is unclear whether the observed differences in these  brain regions and circuitry in obese relative to normal-weight individuals are a cause,  consequence, or both, of the obese state. Moreover, relatively little is known about the  developmental ontogeny of these brain regions and circuitry, particularly during the fetal period,  and their prospective role in shaping propensity for childhood obesity. This project addresses  this fundamental knowledge gap. We will develop novel measures and conduct analyses using newborn  brain imaging and other data elements from 4 inter-linked NIH-funded projects on prenatal stress  and fetal programming of brain development and infant body composition (R01 HD-060628; R01  MH-091351; R01 HD-065825; UG3 OD-023349). The importance of selecting the newborn brain as the  starting time point derives from the logic that brain circuitry at this time could not yet have  been influenced by postnatal factors such as diet/feeding, thereby enabling the study to  disentangle the temporality of effects. In a recent position paper on the pathogenesis of obesity,  the U.S. Endocrine Society emphasized the need to conceptualize obesity as a disorder of the  energy homeostasis system and elucidate its underlying mechanisms and developmental influences.  Towards this objective, and using a population of ~100 mother-infant dyads followed from early  gestation through birth till 5 yrs age, we will integrate research aims that leverage the resources  of these projects to advance our understanding of the origins of childhood obesity. Aim 1.  Develop measures of energy homeostasis brain circuitry using anatomical, diffusion and functional  MRI. Because such measures have not yet been established in newborn homeostasis circuitry,  this aim will fulfill an important need in terms of not only scientific knowledge but also  technical capability. Aim 2. Address the physiological relevance and clinical significance of these  novel MRI-based newborn brain measures by testing the hypothesis that measures of the human  newborn’s energy homeostasis brain circuitry are prospectively associated with infant adiposity  and subsequent childhood obesity risk. Aim 3. Identify the prenatal (gestational biology)  determinants of variation in the measures of newborn brain energy homeostasis circuitry that are  associated with infant adiposity. Significance. By identifying the role and determinants of  energy homeostasis-related brain circuitry in the human newborn, these findings will ultimately  provide the basis for the subsequent development of strategies aimed at the primary prevention of  childhood obesity. This proposal describes a comprehensive plan to conduct research that aims to identify  novel MRI-based measures of energy homeostasis-related brain circuitry in the human newborn,  determine the prospective association of these measures with subsequent risk for childhood  obesity, and identify their gestational biology determinants. The identification of brain-related  biomarkers of childhood obesity risk that predate the influence of the obesogenic environment  will contribute to an improved understanding of the neurological underpinnings of obesity, early  identification of at-risk individuals, and intervention targets for primary prevention.",Human Newborn Energy Homeostasis Brain Networks And Infant

"Structural Development of Human Fetal Brain Abstract Despite its critical significance, little is known about the most dynamic phase of brain development in infancy: 0-2 years. To change the status quo, comprehensive and quantitative infant brain atlases as reference standards for precision health are needed. In addition, diffusion MRI (dMRI) has entered a new era in which dynamic cortical internal microstructural complexity, indexed by e.g. cortical mean kurtosis derived from diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI), can be studied in the living infant brain noninvasively using more advanced multi-shell dMRI. Furthermore, multi-modality measures offer unparalleled insights into mechanistic structure- function and structure-behavior relationships. Work in the current cycle has focused on structural development of human fetal and preterm brains. Based on high resolution diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of 150 brains, we have established the atlases and quantified cortical microstructure with cortical fractional anisotropy, validated by histological images and correlated with transcriptomic (RNA) expression. Building upon this work, in the next cycle, we will focus on brain development in infancy, immediately after the fetal period. Specifically, the goal is to establish next-generation dMRI atlases (quantitative UPenn-CHOP infant brain atlases) and to harness a more advanced cortical microstructural mean kurtosis measurement by delineating its 4D spatiotemporal frameworks as well as uncovering its relationship to brain function and behavior during infancy (0-2 years). 160 typically developing infants at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 months will be recruited. Advanced “connectome-quality” multi-band high-resolution multi-shell dMRI, resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) and structural MRI will be acquired. High-quality whole-head magnetoencephalography (MEG) will also be acquired. Anatomical labels of all 122 major gray and white matter structures will be built up based on high contrasts from DTI-derived maps. The measurements of DTI-derived metrics will be used for the quantitative components of DTI atlases and age-dependent white matter tract trajectories (Aim 1). Mean kurtosis of the 4th order kurtosis tensor has been shown to be sensitive to cortical internal microstructural changes of infant brains. The spatiotemporal sensitivity of mean kurtosis measures to infant age and cortical region will be investigated (Aim 2). Furthermore, we will establish mechanistic structure-function relationships with multi- modality imaging, including not only multi-shell dMRI, but also rs-fMRI and MEG, all optimized for infant brains (Aim 3). The quantitative infant brain atlases and normal developmental trajectories will provide reference standards for “pre-“diagnostic risk assessment, filling a gap towards precision health for infants (e.g. Z-score maps). Infant cortical microstructure will be delineated noninvasively with 4D spatiotemporal frameworks. With multi-modality strength, the fundamental structure-function and structure-behavior mechanistic relations will set the stage for understanding aberrant brain development in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autistic spectrum disorder and intellectual disabilities in general.

"Effects of Prenatal Opiates on Infant Brain and Neurobehavioral Development ABSTRACT Opioid use during pregnancy has increased dramatically in the past decade, and may pose significant health challenges for the rapidly growing number of exposed infants born to mothers using illicit and/or prescribed opioids. Prenatal opioid exposure (OE) is inconsistently related to impaired neurobehavior, attention, and cognition in infancy and childhood, suggesting persistent, potentially life-long, consequences. This fetal exposure occurs during a time of extraordinary brain growth and organization, making it a critical period of vulnerability to environmental insult. However, little is known about the effects of OE on early human brain development that may contribute to reported deficits. The objectives of this proposal are to quantify the effects of OE on the development of infant brain functional connectivity in postnatal months 1-12, to determine associations with neurobehavioral and cognitive outcomes, and to examine how gender, other prenatal drug exposures, and postnatal environmental factors moderate these effects. Our central hypothesis is that fetal brain development and organization are altered by OE; deficits in developing connections and networks mediate the negative effects of OE on simultaneously developing neurobehavior and early cognition; gender, other drugs and postnatal environment interact with OE to influence growth trajectories of rapidly developing connections and networks that subserve emerging abilities. This hypothesis is based on the study team’s substantial research experience with mother-infant dyads with prenatal opioid and other drug exposures (Jones, Grewen), and on strong preliminary data showing normative development of functional networks from birth to 2 years (Gao), disruptions in neonatal functional connectivity due to prenatal opioids and other drugs (Grewen, Gao), and on associations between functional connections and behavioral effects (Grewen, Gao). The rationale for the proposed research is that longitudinal study will quantify direct and interactive effects of initial neural insult, infant gender and postnatal environment on developing functional connections. The hypotheses will be tested with 3 Specific Aims: 1) Quantify the extent to which OE impairs developing functional connections at 2 weeks and again at 12 months; 2) Determine the extent to which the effects of OE on neurobehavior, attention, self-regulation and cognition are related to developmental trajectories of functional connections; 3) Determine how infant gender, other prenatal drug exposures, and a Cumulative Environmental Risk Index moderate the effects of OE on developing connectivity. This approach is innovative because it will employ hypothesis-driven analyses as well as novel, exploratory data-driven and machine learning methods to quantify direct and interactive effects of OE and other drug exposures on functional circuitry. The proposed research is significant because rates of prenatal OE and NAS have increased 5-fold since 2000, in parallel with the opioid epidemic, and because knowledge gleaned has potential to identify factors that may protect or further harm growing functional networks underlying nascent cognitive abilities in this at-risk group. NARRATIVE The proposed research will provide currently unavailable knowledge of the effects of prenatal opioid and other drug exposures on developing brain functional connections and networks that subserve emerging behaviors and cognition in the first year of life, and will shed light on modifiable postnatal factors that may enhance or further impair early brain development. At a broader level, this work is relevant to understanding brain mechanisms underlying developing attention/arousal systems and how these brain-behavior connections may be altered by biological or environmental challenges. It is relevant to public health because the number of women using opioids during pregnancy is rapidly growing, in parallel with the current opioid epidemic. This research is relevant to NIDA’s mission because it seeks to identify the physiological and social substrates and mechanisms involved in the cognitive and behavioral effects produced by drugs of abuse in an exceptionally vulnerable population--infants exposed in utero.",Effects of Prenatal Opiates on Infant Brain and Neurobehavioral Development,9774005,R01DA043678,"['Alcohols ', ' Alcohol

"Impact of Maternal Diet and Supplements on Breast Milk Composition Breast-feeding is recommended to prevent the development of allergic diseases, but mechanisms are unclear. Human milk is a source of human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) and fatty acids (FAs), which are likely impacted by maternal diet. HMOs are complex glycans prevalent in human milk; non-digestible by humans, but one of the main substrates for the infant gut microbiota. We have recently shown that mothers' milk has significant variations in qualitative and quantitative HMO composition, depending on genetics and maternal probiotic supplementation. Human milk is a rich source of FAs such as polyunsaturated (PUFAs) and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs); these are strongly influenced by maternal diet and could directly induce mucosal immunity. The impact of maternal diet and supplements on immunomodulatory composition of human milk is poorly characterized and varies between mothers.  Our initial studies have shown that certain HMOs are associated with protection against cow's milk allergy in the infant, but the mechanisms are not known. Our initial study in the Old Order Mennonites (OOM), who have a lifestyle dating back to 150 years ago and rich exposure to unpasteurized milk, indicated a low prevalence of asthma and allergic diseases, compared to the Rochester population. OOM mothers also have rich sources of diet-based probiotics such as unpasteurized dairy products (kefir, yogurt, cheese, butter); these can significantly affect their breast milk FA and HMO composition, whereas OTC supplement use may not be common. Our central hypothesis is that factors related to OOM diet decrease the risk of allergies through impact on human milk composition. Our preliminary data suggests that the infant gut microbiome is enriched in Bifidobacteria in the OOM. Bifidobacteria in turn are largely impacted by human milk composition.  The overall objective of this supplemental application is to expand our ongoing longitudinal infant cohort study, entitled “Mucosal and systemic immunity and food allergy” (U01 AI131344), by gathering and analyzing samples to define the role of maternal diet, including dietary and OTC probiotics on human milk composition, and to assess their impact on infant immunity. The parent study is characterizing the infant gut microbiome, immune markers and atopic diseases in the first year of life in OOM and Rochester infants. We have a unique opportunity to investigate maternal dietary impact on human milk composition. This additional data along with modeling as part of the parent grant will provide holistic understanding of interactions between OOM lifestyle and infant gut microbiome composition, immune markers and allergic disease outcomes in infants. 1 Our initial study in the Old Order Mennonites (OOM), who have a lifestyle dating back to 150 years ago and rich exposure to unpasteurized milk, indicated a low prevalence of asthma and allergic diseases, compared to the Rochester population.

"Automated Assessment of Neurodevelopment in Infants at Risk for Motor Disability PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The overall goal of this R01 project is to develop an automated assessment system that can capitalize on state of the art sensing technologies and machine learning algorithms to enable accurate and early detection of infants at risk for neurodevelopmental disabilities. In the USA, 1 in 10 infants are born at risk for these disabilities. For children with neurodevelopmental disabilities, early treatment in the first year of life improves long-term outcomes. However, we are currently held back by inadequacies of available clinical tests to measure and predict impairment. Existing tests are hard to administer, require specialized training, and have limited long- term predictive value. There is a critical need to develop an objective, accurate, easy-to-use tool for the early prediction of long-term physical disability. The field of pediatrics and infant development would greatly benefit from a quantitative score that would correlate with existing clinical measures used today to detect movement impairments in very young infants. To realize a new generation of tests that will be easy to administer, we will obtain large datasets of infants playing in an instrumented gym or simply being recorded while moving in a supine posture. Video and sensor data analyses will convert movement into feature vectors based on our knowledge of the problem domain. Our approach will use machine learning to relate these feature vectors to currently recommended clinical tests or other ground truth information. The power of this design is that algorithms can utilize many aspects of movement to produce the relevant scores. Our preliminary data allows us to lay the following aims: 1)Aim 1: To assess concurrent validity of a multimodal instrumented gym with existing clinical tools. Here, using 150 infants (75 with early brain injury and 75 controls), we will focus on converting data from an instrumented gym into estimates of the standard clinical tests; 2)Aim 2: To develop a computer vision-based algorithm to quantify infant motor performance from single camera video. Here using video data from 1200 infants (400 with early brain injury, 400 preterm without early brain injury, 400 controls), plus those gathered from Aim 1 and Aim 3, we will extract pose data from single-camera video recordings and convert these into kinematic features and relevant scores needed to classify infant movement; 3)Aim3: To discover the features related to long-term motor development. Here we will convert data collected longitudinally from 50 infants (25 with early brain injury and 25 controls) using both instrumented gym and video recordings into estimates standard clinical tests change over time and track features over developmental timescales. These three aims spearhead the use of real world behavior for movement scoring. Our aims will bring us closer to a universal non-invasive test for early detection of neurodevelopmental disabilities and lay the groundwork for long-term prediction of disability. But above all, it promises to scale to infants worldwide, producing an affordable tool to aid in infant health assessment. NARRATIVE Increased survival rates of medically fragile infants lead to an increased number of children with functional impairments later in life. Early detection of motor delays or impairments provides the opportunity for early treatment which improves health outcomes. This study will use state of the art sensors combined with machine learning approaches to develop objective, accurate, easy-to-use tools for the early scoring of deficits and lays the foundation for the early prediction of physical disability.",Automated Assessment of Neurodevelopment in Infants at Risk for Motor Disability,9765496,R01HD097686,"['Algorithms ', ' Asphyxia ', ' asphyxiation ', ' Suffocation ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Behavior ', ' Birth History ', ' Calibration ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' computer vision ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Diagnosis ', ' training status ', ' training level ', ' training achievement ', ' educational level ', ' Educational Achievement ', ' Educational Status ', ' Non-Trunk ', ' Limbs ', ' Extremities ', ' Limb structure ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' hydrocephalic ', ' Hydrocephaly ', ' Hydrocephalus ', ' Infant ', ' Infection ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' longterm study ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' body movement ', ' Movement ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' neuroplasticity ', ' neuroplastic ', ' neural plasticity ', ' CNS plasticity ', ' Neuronal Plasticity ', ' Pediatrics ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Play ', ' Posture ', ' pressure ', ' Risk ', ' Seizures ', ' Supination ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Toy ', ' Translating ', ' video recording system ', ' Videorecording ', ' Video Recording ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Specific Child Development Disorders ', ' Developmental Delay ', ' Developmental Delay Disorders ', ' physical handicap ', ' physical disability ', ' Physically Disabled ', ' Physically Handicapped ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' preterm delivery ', ' premature delivery ', ' premature childbirth ', ' Preterm Birth ', ' Prematurely delivering ', ' Premature Birth ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Infant Development ', ' Infant Health ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Intuition ', ' School-Age Population ', ' school age ', ' Hand Strength ', ' Grip strength ', ' Brain Injuries ', ' brain-injured ', ' brain damage ', ' Acquired brain injury ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' instrument ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' skeletal ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' Performance ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Neural Development ', ' kinematics ', ' kinematic model ', ' Early identification ', ' functional disability ', ' Functional impairment ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Age-Months ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' vector ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Neurodevelopmental Disability ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' functional outcomes ', ' infant monitoring ', ' infant measurement ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' Impairment ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' motor impairment ', ' movement limitation ', ' movement impairment ', ' motor control ', ' critical period ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' screening ', ' prognostic tool ', ' neonatal stroke ', ' drug abuse in pregnancy ', ' prenatal drug use ', ' pregnant drug abuser ', ' drugs used while pregant ', ' drug use in pregnancy ', ' recruit ', ' sensor technology ', ' sensing technology ', ' early screening ', ' health assessment ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,711064,PA-03,0.14505174445388455
"Infant statistical learning: Resilience, longevity, and specificity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Typically developing infants acquire language at a remarkable rate despite numerous perceptual and cognitive challenges. Infants may begin to learn language by tracking regularities in their environment. Specifically, research suggests that infants possess powerful computational mechanisms that may support the segmentation of words from fluent speech and facilitate word learning. The problem is that there is little research on the extent to which statistical regularities support early language acquisition under the challenging learning conditions often faced by young infants. The objective of the proposed research is to advance integrative and comprehensive theories of infant language acquisition by assessing how statistical learning supports (1) speech segmentation and word learning in background noise, (2) infants' ability to encode lexical representations in long-term memory, and (3) infants' abilities to represent newly segmented words with the appropriate level and type of detail to facilitate subsequent language learning. Three Aims will be addressed across nine experiments designed to test how statistical regularities found in natural language input support resilience, longevity, and representational specificity within a developmental framework. Infants will be familiarized with a short natural Italian language corpus and then tested on their ability o either discriminate words that have strong versus weak internal co-occurrence patterns (8- and 11-month-olds), or associate those words with novel objects (17-month-olds). Experiments are designed to tests how infants cope with simultaneous learning challenges. We will test the predictions that strong syllable co-occurrence patterns will bolster (1) speech segmentation and word learning in noise and (2) long-term memory for newly extracted words, and (3) that infants' word form representations will become more robust and specific. Results from the proposed project will advance our understanding of the learning mechanisms underlying normative language development. Individuals who are, for a variety of sensory, neurological, or developmental reasons, less adept at tracking and representing statistical regularities when faced with real-world learning challenges may be at greater risk for atypical language development. Results from the proposed research will be used to help generate and test hypotheses about the causal mechanisms for specific language delays in atypical populations, such as for infants with hearing loss or infants who, for various reasons, receive sub-optimal language input during critical developmental periods. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed set of studies explores potential mechanisms underlying positive language outcomes in typically developing infants. Being at risk for atypical language development poses a major health concern. The results of the project will help us generate testable hypotheses about the causal mechanisms for specific language delays in atypical populations, such as for infants with hearing loss or infants who, for various reasons, receive sub-optimal language input during critical developmental periods, and will begin to address NIH's need for evidence-based research to guide clinical practice.","Infant statistical learning: Resilience, longevity, and specificity",9753018,R01HD083312,"['Affect ', ' Felis sylvestris catus ', ' Felis domesticus ', ' Felis domestica ', ' Feline Species ', ' Domestic Cats ', ' Cats Mammals ', ' Cats ', ' Felis catus ', ' Bats ', ' Chiroptera ', ' critical developmental period ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' indexing ', ' Infant ', ' Language ', ' Language Delays ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Language Development ', ' Learning ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Memory ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Noise ', ' Play ', ' Probability ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' sound ', ' Specificity ', ' Speech ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Gender ', ' Label ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Individual ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' long term memory ', ' longterm memory ', ' Hour ', ' Complex ', ' Stream ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' theories ', ' hearing impairment ', ' hearing dysfunction ', ' hearing disability ', ' hearing difficulty ', ' hearing deficit ', ' hearing defect ', ' dysfunctional hearing ', ' Hypoacusis ', ' Hypoacuses ', ' Hearing Loss ', ' Address ', ' Cognitive ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Output ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' lexical ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' clinical practice ', ' natural language ', ' word learning ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' language outcome ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE KNOXVILLE,R01,2019,268205,TN-02,0.006177857432726742
"What you see is what you learn: Visual attention in statistical word learning PROJECT SUMMARY Individual differences in the quantity and quality of parent talk and individual differences in infant visual attention predict later vocabulary development, which in turn has the cascading consequences of later cognitive development and school achievement. The proposed research studies how infants prior to their first birthday begin to learn object names, and does so in a unique approach, focusing on how visual information from the infant perspective coincide with parent naming and on how infant looking behavior selects the data to be aggregated and how that selected data changes incrementally in statistical learning. Toward this goal, we will collect a corpus of infant-perspective scenes from 8-12-month-old infants as they play with their parent in a toy room and as parents naturally name objects during play. We will analyze the referential ambiguity of the scenes that co-occur with parent naming events, by showing the scenes to infants and tracking their gaze direction in free viewing. We will use the gaze data to quantify ambiguity in terms of the uncertainty, correctness, and informativeness of the scenes as to the intended object referent. We will then construct training sets for cross-situational learning experiments from the collected scenes by manipulating the mix of high and low ambiguity trials. We will test a series of hypotheses about how infants aggregate information to learn multiple object names.  Moreover, we will feed the trial-by-trial gaze data of individual infants to models to predict final learning outcomes, with the goal of specifying attentional and memory processes that support learning. Our overarching aim of the project is to show that the infant-perspective scenes co- occurring with early naming events have properties that guide and train infant visual attention and in so doing support the learning of names and their referents through the aggregation of information across multiple naming events.

"Cerebral Palsy Risk Identification System PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT [ Pediatric specialists are often required to identify infants who are likely to suffer poor neurodevelopmental outcome, including Cerebral Palsy (CP). CP is the most common developmental disability among children in the United States and results from several factors, including low weight for gestational age, premature birth, and stroke. Although MRI and cranial ultrasound (cUS) provide valuable structural information in the preterm period, they have moderate sensitivity to CP and require transportation of the infant. Over the past 20 years, numerous studies have validated the clinical potential of General Movement Assessment (GMA) for CP risk identification. During the early period, (23 weeks to 36 weeks gestational age), the presence of Cramped Synchronized General Movements (CSGMs), has demonstrated very high sensitivity and specificity for CP, conjointly ranging from 80%-98%. CSGMs are assessed while preterm infants are still in an acute care facility (NICU) and can inform the clinician independently, and in combination with cUS and MRI. Despite its potential, GMA is available in only a few clinical centers, as adoption and routine application depend on lengthy, cost-intensive observation and availability of specially trained raters. A Cerebral Palsy Risk Identification System (CPRIS) is proposed that will automate GMA for bedside evaluations in both preterm and postterm periods. The CPRIS constitutes a key enabling technology not only for routine risk identification, but also for establishing disease trajectory and potentially differentiating CP subtypes and assessing efficacy of emerging treatments along the early developmental continuum.  Preliminary studies at UC Irvine have demonstrated that GMA analysis for CSGMs can be automated by quantifying infant limb movement using highly miniaturized, 3-axis wireless accelerometers and classifying CSGMs using a patented Markov-type approach that merges an application-specific Erlang-Cox state transition model with a Dynamic Bayesian Network (“EC-DBN”), treating instantaneous machine learning classification values as observations and explicitly modeling CSGM (and non-CSGM) duration and interval. In Phase I, this approach will be utilized in a comparative evaluation of two movement measurement modalities to determine which has the best overall performance and clinical utility at three leading NICU centers. Infant movement data will be concurrently acquired using an advanced, second generation prototype wireless accelerometer system (CPRIS-A) and a high definition 3D (infrared) optical camera (CPRIS-O). The optical modality offers significant potential advantages as it requires no infant contact and can monitor unattended, intermittently, over weeks or months. However, its potential for GMA automation must be systematically evaluated. Classifier results from both modalities will be compared to expert rater consensus in 80 preterm infants. The primary outcome will be CSGM identification accuracy, as determined by ROC-AUC analyses, with a threshold for success of 0.85. Additional comparative performance measures include reliability and practicability in the NICU environment. An Advisory Committee of experts in the fields of neonatology, pediatrics and cerebral palsy will evaluate project results and advise on the clinical potential of each modality. ] PROJECT NARRATIVE Cerebral palsy is the most common physical disability in childhood, with a prevalence of 2.1 cases per 1000 in high-income countries. The overall project goal is to develop a computerized hardware-software system capable of identifying preterm infants at high risk of developing cerebral palsy (CP), based on the systematic identification of specific patterns of movement-derived features. The Cerebral Palsy Risk Identification System (CPRIS) will enable clinical staff with only minimal training to cost effectively implement General Movement Assessment (GMA) for Cramped Synchronous General Movements (CSGMs), with interpretive reporting performed automatically.

"High-density markers of mother-infant bio-behavioral activity ""in the wild"": Developing a mobile-sensing paradigm to examine transmission of mental health risks Project Summary Major theories of socioemotional development suggest that adaptive patterns of self-regulation reflect the accumulation of thousands of individual daily experiences of distress. In particular, parents’ efforts to regulate their infants’ distress are thought to provide critical inputs to developing self-regulation skills. Factors affecting caregiving, such as caregiver stress or mood disorders, are thought to limit parents’ ability to provide this early support. Thus, early-emerging patterns of mother-infant interaction are theorized to be an important mechanism by which mental health risks are transmitted from caregivers to their children. However, empirical evidence for these theories are scarce, as it has not been possible to systematically capture episodes of distress as they occur in day-to-day mother and infant activity. Additionally, most studies cannot disentangle complex interactions between infant and maternal psychobiological factors. For example, highly fussy infants are more likely to stress and overwhelm their parents, thereby likely affecting parental regulation efforts and potentially exacerbating their own early biological predispositions. Datasets capturing the details of daily interactions between mothers and their infants are needed to access the basic bio-behavioral mechanisms of developing psychopathology risk. In the future, such rich datasets could also provide a foundation for emerging “just in time” interventions that could provide mothers with real-time support and reassurance during day-to-day activities. To thus advance the field of developmental psychopathology, this proposal will leverage emerging “wearable” or mobile-sensor technologies to capture episodes of infant distress and subsequent maternal regulation efforts as they occur in the typical day-to-day activities of infants and their mothers. The research aims of this proposal are 1) to develop a mobile-sensing platform that will automatically detect detailed markers of mother-infant distress-related activity as participants go about their daily lives, captured via a synchronized suite of “wearable” physiology, audio and proximity sensors, and once validated, to use this platform to 2) investigate the daily mechanisms of maladaptive mother-infant interaction dynamics The training goals of this proposal are to 1) develop my expertise with state-of-the art computational tools to study mother-infant activity in the “wild”, allowing me unprecedented access to the dynamic processes of bio- behavioral development, and 2) to provide me the opportunity bridge my work to the domain of developmental psychopathology. The proposed K01 is thus a key step in my goal to develop a research program that can harness the rich dynamics of day-to-day activity to support theoretically-driven clinical innovations. Children of mothers with depression anxiety and stress are at increased risk for a range of maladaptive outcomes, including both internalizing and externalizing mental health disorders. The current training proposal will develop a state-of-the-art mobile sensor paradigm to capture high-density ecologically valid markers of mother-infant interactions—a key mechanism of the transmission of psychopathology from mothers to their children—and use this paradigm to examine how daily activity and exposures contribute to adaptive and maladaptive dynamics of mother-infant interaction.","High-density markers of mother-infant bio-behavioral activity ""in the wild"": Developing a mobile-sensing paradigm to examine transmission of mental health risks",9750800,K01MH111957,"['Affect ', ' Anxiety ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' childrearing ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' Parenting ', ' Child Rearing ', ' Data Collection ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Feedback ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human Development ', ' Infant ', ' Laboratories ', ' longterm study ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Moods ', ' Mothers ', ' Motion ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurobiology ', ' Parents ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Physiology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Ecosystem ', ' Ecological Systems ', ' Ecologic Systems ', ' density ', ' sensor ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Training ', ' Distress ', ' infancy ', ' infantile ', ' Individual ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' experience ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' developmental psychology ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Emotional ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Caregiver Burden ', ' caregiver stress ', ' care giver stress ', ' Care giver Burden ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Preventive ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Resolution ', ' Emerging Technologies ', ' Emergent Technologies ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' caregiving ', ' care giving ', ' biobehavior ', ' biobehavioral ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' Outcome ', ' Individual Differences ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' maternal depression ', ' depressed mother ', ' psychobiologic ', ' psychobiological ', ' high risk ', ' novel marker ', ' novel biomarker ', ' new marker ', ' Systems Development ', ' stress disorder ', ' discrete time ', ' sensor technology ', ' sensing technology ', ' wearable sensor technology ', ' wireless sensor technology ', ' ']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",K01,2019,118352,TX-10,0.06987876923361716

Among these factors, the critical importance of energy homeostasis (balance), and the hypothalamic-limbic-cortical brain circuitry that regulates it, is well established. However, it is unclear whether the observed difference in this brain circuitry between obese and normal-weight individuals is a cause or consequence of the obese state. Also, relatively little is known about the developmental origin (fetal and early postnatal) of variation in this brain circuitry and its prospective role in shaping propensity for childhood obesity. My proposal addresses this fundamental knowledge gap. I advance the overarching hypothesis that energy homeostasis brain circuitry a) already is established by the time of birth; b) exhibits developmental plasticity (fetal programming); and c) is functionally relevant (predicts postnatal adipose tissue accrual). The K99 mentored phase will be conducted under the mentorship of leading experts in fetal programming of health and disease (P. Wadhwa), brain imaging (P. Thompson), and developmental systems neuroscience (D. Fair). I will first develop novel MRI-based measures of the newborn brain circuitry underlying energy homeostasis, and then identify the prenatal determinants of variation in this circuitry. The importance of focusing efforts on the newborn brain derives from the logic that brain circuitry at this time is not yet influenced by postnatal factors. In the R00 phase, I will recruit a new cohort and use a repeated measures design to address the functional relevance of the initial (newborn) setting of this brain circuitry in the context of adipose tissue accrual over infancy (a key indicator of childhood obesity risk). K99/Aim 1. Develop measures of energy homeostasis brain circuitry using anatomical, diffusion and functional MRI. Because such measures have not yet been established in newborn homeostasis circuitry, this aim will fulfill an important and as yet unmet need in terms of not only scientific knowledge but also technical capability. K99/Aim 2. Identify the prenatal (gestational biology) determinants of variation in the measures of newborn brain energy homeostasis circuitry that are associated with infant adiposity. R00/Aim 3. Address the physiological relevance and clinical significance of these novel MRI-based newborn brain measures by testing the hypothesis that measures of the human newborn’s energy homeostasis brain circuitry are prospectively associated with infant adiposity and subsequent childhood obesity risk. R00/Aim 4. Consider the complimentary hypothesis that infant adiposity at birth is prospectively associated with changes in newborn energy homeostasis brain circuitry. Significance. By identifying the role and determinants of energy homeostasis-related brain circuitry in the human newborn, these findings will ultimately provide the basis for the subsequent development of strategies aimed at the primary prevention of childhood obesity. This proposal describes a comprehensive plan for the applicant, Dr. Jerod Rasmussen, to obtain expert training and conduct research that aims to identify novel MRI-based measures of energy homeostasis-related brain circuitry in the human newborn, identify their gestational biology determinants, and determine the prospective association of these measures with subsequent risk for childhood obesity. The identification of brain-related biomarkers of childhood obesity risk that predate the influence of the obesogenic environment will contribute to an improved understanding of the neurological underpinnings of obesity, early identification of at-risk individuals, and intervention targets for primary prevention.",Fetal Programming of Human Newborn Energy Homeostasis Brain Networks and Infant

"MRI and Deep Learning for Early Prediction of Neurodevelopmental Deficits in Very Preterm Infants Project Summary/Abstract About 100,000 very preterm infants (VPI; ≤32 weeks gestational age) are born every year in the United States. Up to 35% develop noteworthy neurodevelopmental deficits, thereby increasing their risk for poor educational, health, and social outcomes. Unfortunately, neurodevelopmental deficits cannot currently be reliably diagnosed until 3 to 5 years of age. The imminent challenge lies in early identification of infants that are more likely to develop later deficits. Advances in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and deep learning (DL) provide means to address this challenge. Application of DL to infant brain MRI data can open up new windows into early prediction of neurodevelopmental outcomes in at-risk infants and facilitate the move towards precision medicine. Our objective is to apply DL to MRI acquired at term equivalent age for early prediction of neurodevelopment deficits (cognitive, language, and motor) at age 2 in VPI. Our group has identified three key components necessary for accurate prognostic models of later neurodevelopment. DL analysis of 1) anatomical features derived from structural MRI (sMRI) allowing detection of brain structural abnormalities and tissue pathologies; 2) brain connectivity features derived from resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) and diffusion MRI (dMRI) giving insights into atypical brain connectivity patterns; and 3) integration of anatomical and connectivity features, thus enhancing abnormal neurodevelopment prediction. In this project, we will dedicate our efforts in accomplishing the following specific aims. In Aim 1 and Aim 2, we will develop deepAna and deepConn models analyzing anatomical and connectivity features independently to predict adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. By decoding each model, we will identify, validate and disseminate a series of the most discriminative anatomical and connectivity features to the research community. In Aim 3, we will develop an ensemble deepAnaConn model analyzing both anatomical and connectivity features, together with clinical risk factors, for early prediction of neurodevelopmental deficits. This model will help clinicians to predict later outcomes for those at-risk prematurely born infants before initial neonatal intensive care unit discharge. We will validate the models using both internal and independent external data and will open the ‘black-box’ of DL to aid interpretation of imaging and clinical findings. The techniques we develop are expected to improve the modelling fidelity in medical diagnosis/ prognosis in the same way as DL has revolutionized other fields. The DL models we develop will not only benefit early detection of neurodevelopmental deficits in VPI, but also likely benefit individuals with other neurodevelopmental and neurological diseases. This study will significantly impact public health because it will allow clinicians to target clinical and experimental intervention therapies to the most at-risk infants during periods of optimal neuroplasticity, and thus ultimately improve medical outcomes and patient well-being. Project Narrative Babies born at younger than 32 weeks’ gestation (~100,000 per year in the US) are at high risk for neurodevelopmental problems that can have a lifelong impact on quality of life. Early, targeted intervention while the brain is still malleable is the key, but accurately predicting which children will develop which problems, has not yet been successful. Herein, we propose to use artificial intelligence/deep learning, which works by feeding a computer program with existing imaging, clinical and outcome data, and then generating a template by which clinicians can compare new imaging and clinical data to accurately predict outcomes, thus allowing early, aggressive intervention where appropriate.",MRI and Deep Learning for Early Prediction of Neurodevelopmental Deficits in Very Preterm Infants,10028428,R01EB029944,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Child Welfare ', ' adolescent welfare ', ' child well being ', ' child wellbeing ', ' Communities ', ' computer program ', ' computer programming ', ' Crowding ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Family ', ' Gestational Age ', ' Chronologic Fetal Maturity ', ' Fetal Age ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Infant ', ' Premature Infant ', ' infants born premature ', ' infants born prematurely ', ' premature baby ', ' premature infant human ', ' preterm baby ', ' preterm infant ', ' preterm infant human ', ' Neonatal Intensive Care Units ', ' Newborn Intensive Care Units ', ' neonatal ICU ', ' Language ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Anatomic Models ', ' Anatomical Models ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neuronal Plasticity ', ' CNS plasticity ', ' central nervous system plasticity ', ' neural plasticity ', ' neuroplastic ', ' neuroplasticity ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prognosis ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Psychological Transfer ', ' learning transfer ', ' training transfer ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Funding ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Dimensions ', ' Distant ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' brain tissue ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' Neural Development ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' social ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' Early identification ', ' Modeling ', ' depository ', ' repository ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) ', ' DWI-MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion weighted imaging ', ' Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' dMRI ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Motor ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Pathologic ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' neonate ', ' feeding ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Neurodevelopmental Deficit ', ' Neurodevelopmental Problem ', ' Outcome ', ' 5 years of age ', ' age 5 years ', ' five year old ', ' five years of age ', ' 5 year old ', ' multi-task ', ' multitask ', ' high risk ', ' multi-modality ', ' multimodality ', ' clinical risk ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' precision medicine ', ' Structural malformation ', ' structural abnormalities ', ' structural anomalies ', ' Structural defect ', ' accurate diagnosis ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' outcome prediction ', ' connectome ', ' Risk stratification ', ' high dimensionality ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' risk prediction model ', ' classification algorithm ', ' large data sets ', ' large datasets ', ' ']",NIBIB,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,R01,2020,534605,OH-01,0.08101077083273044
"Decoding the neural time-course of spoken word recognition Project Summary  Word recognition is crucial not only for comprehending spoken language but for mapping spoken words onto text in reading. Individuals with language and reading deficits (e.g., Specific Language Impairment, Dyslexia, Autism, which together affect up to 16% of children) have been shown to have deficits in word recognition, making it crucial to understand this process. A hallmark of word recognition is that listeners activate neural representations of multiple candidate words that are consistent with the early acoustic input, and these candidates compete for recognition as they unfold in real-time.  The overall goal of this proposal is to capitalize on recent developments in multivariate and machine- learning techniques for analyzing signals obtained from the human brain to measure the real-time unfolding of spoken word recognition. Although these techniques have been most widely used with fMRI data, we propose to extend them to EEG data because EEG is easily used with children and clinical populations, and provides access to the time-course of word recognition, thereby revealing underlying cognitive mechanisms of word recognition, such as lexical competition. Our preliminary findings using this EEG-based paradigm have demonstrated that we can decode the recognition of a specific word (among a set of 8-12 alternatives) at each msec time-step after stimulus onset. The method is sensitive to partial activation of competing words that share some phonological features with the target word, thereby revealing the dynamics of lexical competition as the word-recognition system settles on the final target.  Our objectives are to conduct a series of small-scale experiments that achieve three aims. First, we develop and optimize the method with adults (e.g., the experimental procedure and computational implementation). Second, we validate the method with adults by measuring its test/re-test reliability, comparing its estimates of word recognition with traditional behavioral paradigms, and examining how lexical status, and semantic and orthographic expectations shape lexical competition revealed by the EEG measure. This will yield a new, non-invasive, and highly reliable method suitable for assessing spoken word recognition in adults, children, and special populations. Third, we will preliminarily extend the method to children to pave the way for future developmental studies. Taken together, accomplishing these three aims would provide an innovative and powerful tool for assessing a crucial component of language processing in a wide variety of typical and atypical populations.

"Effects of Prenatal Opiates on Infant Brain and Neurobehavioral Development ABSTRACT Opioid use during pregnancy has increased dramatically in the past decade, and may pose significant health challenges for the rapidly growing number of exposed infants born to mothers using illicit and/or prescribed opioids. Prenatal opioid exposure (OE) is inconsistently related to impaired neurobehavior, attention, and cognition in infancy and childhood, suggesting persistent, potentially life-long, consequences. This fetal exposure occurs during a time of extraordinary brain growth and organization, making it a critical period of vulnerability to environmental insult. However, little is known about the effects of OE on early human brain development that may contribute to reported deficits. The objectives of this proposal are to quantify the effects of OE on the development of infant brain functional connectivity in postnatal months 1-12, to determine associations with neurobehavioral and cognitive outcomes, and to examine how gender, other prenatal drug exposures, and postnatal environmental factors moderate these effects. Our central hypothesis is that fetal brain development and organization are altered by OE; deficits in developing connections and networks mediate the negative effects of OE on simultaneously developing neurobehavior and early cognition; gender, other drugs and postnatal environment interact with OE to influence growth trajectories of rapidly developing connections and networks that subserve emerging abilities. This hypothesis is based on the study team’s substantial research experience with mother-infant dyads with prenatal opioid and other drug exposures (Jones, Grewen), and on strong preliminary data showing normative development of functional networks from birth to 2 years (Gao), disruptions in neonatal functional connectivity due to prenatal opioids and other drugs (Grewen, Gao), and on associations between functional connections and behavioral effects (Grewen, Gao). The rationale for the proposed research is that longitudinal study will quantify direct and interactive effects of initial neural insult, infant gender and postnatal environment on developing functional connections. The hypotheses will be tested with 3 Specific Aims: 1) Quantify the extent to which OE impairs developing functional connections at 2 weeks and again at 12 months; 2) Determine the extent to which the effects of OE on neurobehavior, attention, self-regulation and cognition are related to developmental trajectories of functional connections; 3) Determine how infant gender, other prenatal drug exposures, and a Cumulative Environmental Risk Index moderate the effects of OE on developing connectivity. This approach is innovative because it will employ hypothesis-driven analyses as well as novel, exploratory data-driven and machine learning methods to quantify direct and interactive effects of OE and other drug exposures on functional circuitry. The proposed research is significant because rates of prenatal OE and NAS have increased 5-fold since 2000, in parallel with the opioid epidemic, and because knowledge gleaned has potential to identify factors that may protect or further harm growing functional networks underlying nascent cognitive abilities in this at-risk group. NARRATIVE The proposed research will provide currently unavailable knowledge of the effects of prenatal opioid and other drug exposures on developing brain functional connections and networks that subserve emerging behaviors and cognition in the first year of life, and will shed light on modifiable postnatal factors that may enhance or further impair early brain development. At a broader level, this work is relevant to understanding brain mechanisms underlying developing attention/arousal systems and how these brain-behavior connections may be altered by biological or environmental challenges. It is relevant to public health because the number of women using opioids during pregnancy is rapidly growing, in parallel with the current opioid epidemic. This research is relevant to NIDA’s mission because it seeks to identify the physiological and social substrates and mechanisms involved in the cognitive and behavioral effects produced by drugs of abuse in an exceptionally vulnerable population--infants exposed in utero.",Effects of Prenatal Opiates on Infant Brain and Neurobehavioral Development,9954064,R01DA043678,"['Alcohols ', ' Alcohol

"An Automated Early Motor Development Risk Screener from Observational Video Recordings of Infants and Toddlers Motor development plays a pivotal role in an infant’s overall development and has a cascading effect on social, cognitive, memory, and language ability. These functions can be compromised when motor development is disrupted; motor disruption is associated with generalized developmental delays. Early screening and identification of delays can allow early interventions with the goal of not just improving motor function but overall development in other domains. Experience with independent or motorized crawling is shown to improve spatial memory in infants. Active motor training, even as early as 3 months, is shown to achieve gains in object exploration and social engagement that persist long after the training sessions, indicating the benefits of early intervention. Children who get developmental screening are more likely to be identified with delays and receive early intervention services compared to those that only receive age-appropriate milestone checks as part of pediatric well-child visits. However, comprehensive motor screening, using standardized instruments, for developmental surveillance is labor intensive and requires specialized training in administration and evaluation. Shortage of resources to perform frequent, gold-standard, comprehensive motor assessments can lead to missed opportunities for early intervention and contribute negatively to lifelong outcomes for infants at risk for behavioral and developmental disorders. In the US, 15-20% of children have a developmental or behavioral disability, but less than a third of them get diagnosed before entering school, preventing opportunities for early intervention during a critical period of brain development. In Phase I, we built a prototype Human Action Recognition Engine (HARE) to automate extraction of infant motor movement from video; then utilized this engine to demonstrate the feasibility of an automated developmental risk screener by leveraging recent advances in machine learning to achieve state of the art accuracies in assessment of infant motor development. In Phase II, we aim to build out the risk screener, SCOREIT, as a clinically deployable, cost-effective, developmental risk assessment tool to identify children who need further clinical follow-up. SCOREIT has the potential to transform early developmental screening by bringing the power of comprehensive motor screening, usually administered only to at-risk children utilizing specialized resources, to underserved and economically-fragile communities. Less than a third of US children receive developmental screening. SCOREIT can bring risk screenings to the over 70% of children that currently do not receive them, increasing opportunities for early intervention for behavioral and developmental disorders. Additionally, the HARE system’s ability to automatically extract and quantify motor movements from video can be an enabler for explorations of early markers for behavioral and developmental disorders, significantly easing manual video coding burdens and accelerating the pace of discoveries. This proposal introduces an automated, portable, low-cost developmental risk assessment tool, SCOREIT, that leverages advances in machine learning to extract motor movements from infant videos and generate a motor developmental score based on a standardized instrument (Alberta Infant Motor Scale; AIMS). SCOREIT has the potential to transform early developmental risk screening by bringing the power of standardized, comprehensive motor screening to underserved, economically-fragile communities, and increase opportunities for early intervention of developmental disorders.",An Automated Early Motor Development Risk Screener from Observational Video Recordings of Infants and Toddlers,9785611,R44HD095783,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Alberta province ', ' Alberta ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Behavior Disorders ', ' behavioral disorder ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cerebral Palsy ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Developmental Coordination Disorders ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Infant ', ' Language ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Manuals ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Occupational Therapy ', ' Parents ', ' Pediatrics ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Play ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' Standardization ', ' Supination ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Video Recording ', ' Videorecording ', ' video recording system ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Developmental Delay ', ' Specific Child Development Disorders ', ' Developmental Delay Disorders ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' screening tools ', ' Screening procedure ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' instrument ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Catalogs ', ' Complex ', ' Stream ', ' System ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Toddler ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Early identification ', ' Modeling ', ' portability ', ' Physiatric Procedure ', ' Physical Medicine Procedure ', ' Physical Therapeutics ', ' Physiotherapy ', ' Physical therapy ', ' developmental disorder ', ' developmental disease ', ' Provider ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Motor ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' cost effective ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' data acquisition ', ' infant outcome ', ' service intervention ', ' prototype ', ' high risk ', ' critical period ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' screening ', ' improved motor function ', ' motor function improvement ', ' cognitive performance ', ' spatial memory ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' Assessment tool ', ' learning network ', ' social involvement ', ' social participation ', ' social engagement ', ' early screening ', ' deep learning ', ' ']",NICHD,"BSOLUTIONS, INC.",R44,2020,601447,WA-07,0.054805158693489994
"Peripheral Immune Development in Premature Infants with  and without NEC Title: Peripheral Immune Development in Premature Infants with and without NEC Abstract: Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a devastating complication of prematurity that frequently results in death (20- 50%) or severe systemic complications. Although NEC is a multifactorial disease, its precise etiology continues to be poorly understood. As such, there are still no effective prevention methods or treatments available. Given increased intestinal and systemic inflammation seen in NEC, it is likely that the dysregulation of the immune system contributes to its pathogenesis. In order to better understand NEC pathogenesis, it is essential to have a solid understanding of normal immune development that occurs over the first two months of age in premature infants. Our preliminary data obtained from fetuses, patients with NEC and control subjects, show that there is a drastic reduction of total and tissue resident memory T cells in the intestinal tissue and an increase in T cells in the periphery. Moreover, NEC is associated with a significant increase in pro-inflammatory macrophages in intestinal tissue, and a concomitant decrease in circulating monocytes. Recent work has begun to address how neonatal peripheral immunity develops. However, data on the peripheral immune development in premature infants over the first two months of life is sparse. Therefore, the goal of this exploratory proposal is to define normal immune development of premature infants over the first two months of life and characterize its dysregulation in patients with NEC. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that development of the peripheral immune system in preterm infants is different in the innate and adaptive immune compartments from that of term infants, and it is this difference that makes them susceptible to NEC. As the blood volume in premature infants is limited, we have developed a methodology to perform deep immunophenotyping on as little as 100 µliters of blood using mass cytometry time of flight (CyTOF). This unique methodology will allow us to address the hypothesis, with the following aims: 1) Define the peripheral immune development of premature infants (<32 weeks) over the first two months of life. We will perform CyTOF on peripheral blood from 50 premature infants, with samples collected at 0, 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks. Deep characterization of the immune cell landscape and maps of the developmental trajectories of the major cell lineages in premature infants will be generated. 2) Identify peripheral immune cell abnormalities associated with the development of NEC. We will identify dysregulation of immune population trajectories specific to premature infants who develop NEC. This information will provide us with a model for the immune cell mechanism underlying susceptibility to NEC. This project would represent the first detailed deep examination of the development of the immune system in premature infants with and without NEC over the first two months, and will provide sufficient data for the development of a large-scale, in-depth study of the mechanism underlying the development of NEC. Project Narrative: Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a devastating complication of premature birth that frequently results in significant mortality and morbidity the pathophysiology of which is incompletely understood. A better understanding of the development of the immune system in premature infants would allow for improved methods to prevent and treat NEC. We propose to use state of the art methods to define the immune system in premature infants in the first two months of life, in order to provide a foundation for further research into the development of treatments for NEC.",Peripheral Immune Development in Premature Infants with  and without NEC,10038410,R21HD102565,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood Volume ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Complication ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Fetus ', ' Foundations ', ' Gestational Age ', ' Chronologic Fetal Maturity ', ' Fetal Age ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' Immunity ', ' Natural Immunity ', ' Innate Immunity ', ' Native Immunity ', ' Non-Specific Immunity ', ' Nonspecific Immunity ', ' Incidence ', ' Infant ', ' Premature Infant ', ' infants born premature ', ' infants born prematurely ', ' premature baby ', ' premature infant human ', ' preterm baby ', ' preterm infant ', ' preterm infant human ', ' Inflammation ', ' Small Intestines ', ' small bowel ', ' Intestines ', ' Intestinal ', ' bowel ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' macrophage ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' monocyte ', ' Blood monocyte ', ' Marrow monocyte ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Second Pregnancy Trimester ', ' 2nd trimester ', ' Midtrimester ', ' Second Trimester ', ' Research ', ' T-Lymphocyte ', ' T-Cells ', ' thymus derived lymphocyte ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Immunophenotyping ', ' Immunologic Subtyping ', ' immunophenotype ', ' Mediating ', ' Prematurely delivering ', ' Preterm Birth ', ' premature childbirth ', ' premature delivery ', ' preterm delivery ', ' Premature Birth ', ' Secondary to ', ' Peripartum ', ' Perinatal ', ' improved ', ' Peripheral ', ' Solid ', ' prematurity ', ' premature ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' peripheral blood ', ' Immunologic Model ', ' Immunological Models ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Cell Lineage ', ' VLBW ', ' very low birth weight ', ' Very Low Birth Weight Infant ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Abnormal Cell ', ' Nature ', ' Life ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Complex ', ' cell type ', ' Necrotizing Enterocolitis ', ' fetal ', ' interest ', ' PBMC ', ' Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' memory T lymphocyte ', ' T memory cell ', ' Prevention ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Cytometry ', ' Sampling ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Age-Months ', ' Data ', ' Economic Burden ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Regulatory Pathway ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' meta data ', ' Metadata ', ' Neonatal ', ' Population ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' therapy development ', ' adaptive immunity ', ' specific biomarkers ', ' Mucosal Immune System ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' cost estimation ', ' cost estimate ', ' ']",NICHD,YALE UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,223344,CT-03,0.07093457927419099
"Role of short chain fatty acids in intestinal barrier maturation in preterm infants PROJECT SUMMARY Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a life-threatening, gastrointestinal (GI) emergency affecting 7-10% of preterm infants with mortality as high as 30-50%. ""Leaky gut"", or intestinal barrier immaturity with elevated intestinal permeability (IP), is the proximate cause of susceptibility to NEC in preterm neonates. Early detection of leaky gut is essential to identify infants at risk for NEC to prevent and reduce disease severity. No clinical factor, routine laboratory test or biomarker alone or in combination have been described that identify preterm neonates with impaired intestinal barrier function who at increased risk for NEC. The goal of this study is to develop a rapid, non-invasive screening tool to identify “at-risk"" preterm infants prior to the onset of NEC. We recently revealed rapid maturation of the intestinal barrier is strongly associated with clinical factors such as early breastmilk feeding, less antibiotic exposure and later post-menstrual age, and significantly higher abundance and metabolic activities of Clostridiales and Bifidobacterium. Although the butyrate producing Clostridiales have been implicated in strengthening the intestinal epithelial barrier and reducing intestinal inflammation, it is unknown whether butyrate and potentially other short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are associated with neonatal intestinal barrier maturation. Our preliminary data revealed butyrate production pathways, in particular Pyruvate/Acetyl-CoA pathway are significantly more abundant in low IP subjects. In this study, we propose to validate a substantiated measure of fecal microbial and/or metabolic biomarkers combined with associated neonatal factors for a rapid, non-invasive screening test. We postulate that the level(s) of metabolic activities, particularly butyrate production and potentially other SCFAs via increased colonization of Clostridiales and Bifidobacterium, are associated with intestinal barrier maturation in preterm neonates. To address our hypothesis, we will leverage existed stool samples collected from a cohort of ~200 preterms (<33 weeks), for whom both microbiota (16S rRNA gene sequencing) and IP (urine non-metabolized sugar probes lactulose and rhamnose) are available, and propose 2 aims: 1) to determine fecal metabolic activities associated with intestinal barrier maturation in preterm neonates <33 weeks gestation; and 2) to identify and characterize butyrate-producing bacteria associated with intestinal permeability in preterm neonates during the first 7-10 days of life. At the completion of the study, we will determine the biomarkers associated with healthy intestinal barrier functions and the discriminatory scheme for accurate classification of high or low IP group. Our long-term goal is to conduct a randomize clinical trial of rationally designed intervention for NEC early prevention. Refinement of the screening tool will identify infants with aberrant leaky gut, an essential prerequisite for subsequent rational design of novel strategies such as clinical trials of probiotics to promote healthy intestinal barrier functions to reduce NEC incidence. PROJECT NARRATIVE ""Leaky gut"", is the proximate cause of susceptibility to necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), a life-threatening, gastrointestinal emergency affecting 7-10% of preterm infants with mortality as high as 30-50%. This proposal will develop and validate a rapid, non-invasive screening test incorporating microbiome-based markers and associated neonatal factors, to identify “at-risk"" preterm infants prior to the onset of NEC. The results of this study will support clinical trials aimed to optimize intestinal maturation and to reduce the burden of NEC complications. This study will address major knowledge gaps of the intestinal microenvironment in preterm infants, and ultimately lead to improved strategies to manage neonatal gastrointestinal health, improve children’s health and quality of life, all which are within the mission of NIDDK.",Role of short chain fatty acids in intestinal barrier maturation in preterm infants,10018932,R21DK123674,"['Acetyl

"Fetal Programming of Human Newborn Energy Homeostasis Brain Networks and Infant Adiposity This proposal describes a rigorous and comprehensive plan designed to obtain expert training in advanced MRI acquisition and analytical methods, developmental systems neuroscience, and fetal programming of health and disease risk. The proposed research relates to the public health problem of childhood obesity, with a specific focus on the characterization, role and determinants of energy homeostasis-related brain circuitry in the human newborn. Obesity is a multi-factorial phenotype. Among these factors, the critical importance of energy homeostasis (balance), and the hypothalamic-limbic-cortical brain circuitry that regulates it, is well established. However, it is unclear whether the observed difference in this brain circuitry between obese and normal-weight individuals is a cause or consequence of the obese state. Also, relatively little is known about the developmental origin (fetal and early postnatal) of variation in this brain circuitry and its prospective role in shaping propensity for childhood obesity. My proposal addresses this fundamental knowledge gap. I advance the overarching hypothesis that energy homeostasis brain circuitry a) already is established by the time of birth; b) exhibits developmental plasticity (fetal programming); and c) is functionally relevant (predicts postnatal adipose tissue accrual). The K99 mentored phase will be conducted under the mentorship of leading experts in fetal programming of health and disease (P. Wadhwa), brain imaging (P. Thompson), and developmental systems neuroscience (D. Fair). I will first develop novel MRI-based measures of the newborn brain circuitry underlying energy homeostasis, and then identify the prenatal determinants of variation in this circuitry. The importance of focusing efforts on the newborn brain derives from the logic that brain circuitry at this time is not yet influenced by postnatal factors. In the R00 phase, I will recruit a new cohort and use a repeated measures design to address the functional relevance of the initial (newborn) setting of this brain circuitry in the context of adipose tissue accrual over infancy (a key indicator of childhood obesity risk). K99/Aim 1. Develop measures of energy homeostasis brain circuitry using anatomical, diffusion and functional MRI. Because such measures have not yet been established in newborn homeostasis circuitry, this aim will fulfill an important and as yet unmet need in terms of not only scientific knowledge but also technical capability. K99/Aim 2. Identify the prenatal (gestational biology) determinants of variation in the measures of newborn brain energy homeostasis circuitry that are associated with infant adiposity. R00/Aim 3. Address the physiological relevance and clinical significance of these novel MRI-based newborn brain measures by testing the hypothesis that measures of the human newborn’s energy homeostasis brain circuitry are prospectively associated with infant adiposity and subsequent childhood obesity risk. R00/Aim 4. Consider the complimentary hypothesis that infant adiposity at birth is prospectively associated with changes in newborn energy homeostasis brain circuitry. Significance. By identifying the role and determinants of energy homeostasis-related brain circuitry in the human newborn, these findings will ultimately provide the basis for the subsequent development of strategies aimed at the primary prevention of childhood obesity. This proposal describes a comprehensive plan for the applicant, Dr. Jerod Rasmussen, to obtain expert training and conduct research that aims to identify novel MRI-based measures of energy homeostasis-related brain circuitry in the human newborn, identify their gestational biology determinants, and determine the prospective association of these measures with subsequent risk for childhood obesity. The identification of brain-related biomarkers of childhood obesity risk that predate the influence of the obesogenic environment will contribute to an improved understanding of the neurological underpinnings of obesity, early identification of at-risk individuals, and intervention targets for primary prevention.",Fetal Programming of Human Newborn Energy Homeostasis Brain Networks and Infant

"Structural Development of Human Fetal Brain Abstract Despite its critical significance, little is known about the most dynamic phase of brain development in infancy: 0-2 years. To change the status quo, comprehensive and quantitative infant brain atlases as reference standards for precision health are needed. In addition, diffusion MRI (dMRI) has entered a new era in which dynamic cortical internal microstructural complexity, indexed by e.g. cortical mean kurtosis derived from diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI), can be studied in the living infant brain noninvasively using more advanced multi-shell dMRI. Furthermore, multi-modality measures offer unparalleled insights into mechanistic structure- function and structure-behavior relationships. Work in the current cycle has focused on structural development of human fetal and preterm brains. Based on high resolution diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of 150 brains, we have established the atlases and quantified cortical microstructure with cortical fractional anisotropy, validated by histological images and correlated with transcriptomic (RNA) expression. Building upon this work, in the next cycle, we will focus on brain development in infancy, immediately after the fetal period. Specifically, the goal is to establish next-generation dMRI atlases (quantitative UPenn-CHOP infant brain atlases) and to harness a more advanced cortical microstructural mean kurtosis measurement by delineating its 4D spatiotemporal frameworks as well as uncovering its relationship to brain function and behavior during infancy (0-2 years). 160 typically developing infants at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 months will be recruited. Advanced “connectome-quality” multi-band high-resolution multi-shell dMRI, resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) and structural MRI will be acquired. High-quality whole-head magnetoencephalography (MEG) will also be acquired. Anatomical labels of all 122 major gray and white matter structures will be built up based on high contrasts from DTI-derived maps. The measurements of DTI-derived metrics will be used for the quantitative components of DTI atlases and age-dependent white matter tract trajectories (Aim 1). Mean kurtosis of the 4th order kurtosis tensor has been shown to be sensitive to cortical internal microstructural changes of infant brains. The spatiotemporal sensitivity of mean kurtosis measures to infant age and cortical region will be investigated (Aim 2). Furthermore, we will establish mechanistic structure-function relationships with multi- modality imaging, including not only multi-shell dMRI, but also rs-fMRI and MEG, all optimized for infant brains (Aim 3). The quantitative infant brain atlases and normal developmental trajectories will provide reference standards for “pre-“diagnostic risk assessment, filling a gap towards precision health for infants (e.g. Z-score maps). Infant cortical microstructure will be delineated noninvasively with 4D spatiotemporal frameworks. With multi-modality strength, the fundamental structure-function and structure-behavior mechanistic relations will set the stage for understanding aberrant brain development in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autistic spectrum disorder and intellectual disabilities in general.

The quantitative infant brain atlases and normal developmental trajectories will provide reference standards for “pre-“diagnostic risk assessment, filling a gap towards precision health for infants.

"Obesity Prevention in Early Life (OPEL): Risk Screening and Targeted Intervention Given the difficulty of reversing obesity once present, there has been increasing focus on the primary prevention of obesity early in the lifecourse. Few attempts have been made to prevent obesity during the first years of life. This proposal summarizes a 5-year program of mentored professional development tied to a multi-method research project intended to improve the identification and potential treatment of infants and toddlers with high risk for obesity. My long-term goal is to prevent obesity by identifying infants at greatest risk and providing for them an effective, family-centered intervention that targets modifiable, life course factors. My central hypothesis, based on my prior research, is that identifying infants at risk for obesity prior to the onset of unhealthy weight gain will enable early intervention. My research plan aims to: (1) create risk prediction models for obesity at age 24 months by linking three existing data systems that combine birth certificate, contextual- level, and health outcome data; (2) test the feasibility of linking these data prospectively to validate the Aim 1 obesity risk prediction models over a 24-month period within a contemporary, clinical cohort; and (3) identify best approaches for family-focused risk communication regarding the prevention of excessive weight gain and obesity in infants and toddlers using a human-centered design approach. Through my career development plan and guidance from my mentors, I will expand upon a foundation in epidemiology and pediatric health services research to develop expertise in machine learning, health informatics, data integration, qualitative methods, human-centered design, and behavior change. Together, the research and educational aims of this proposal will provide me with the necessary groundwork to compete for additional funding as an independent investigator. Specifically, I will seek R03-level grant funding from the NIDDK in year 4 of my K01 award to test the communication strategy developed in Aim 3 and to partner with families to modify an existing behavioral change intervention for use in infancy. By the end of this award, I will be well positioned to apply for funding from the NIDDK to conduct a robust R01-level study that combines the validated prediction models, family- focused communication strategy, and modified intervention to determine whether we can effectively prevent obesity in those infants and toddlers identified as being at the highest risk. This line of research will help ensure that prevention efforts are deployed in an efficient, cost-effective manner and accepted by those who need them. I will accomplish this work under the mentorship of Dr. Aaron E. Carroll, a child health services researcher, and a multidisciplinary team of faculty with expertise machine learning, health informatics, data integration and surveillance, qualitative research, human-centered design approaches, behavior change, and childhood obesity. I am ideally suited to complete this research due to my past research productivity, current mentorship team, open access to health care data, and the established clinical decision support infrastructure at the Indiana University School of Medicine. Project Narrative Increasing evidence suggests that the infancy and toddler periods represent the best opportunity for obesity prevention, but few attempts have been made to prevent obesity during the first years of life. The current proposal seeks to develop practical methods to assess the risk of future obesity in infants and toddlers in the clinical setting, and to partner with families to explore new ways to communicate early life obesity risk in ways that account for their perceptions, concerns and beliefs. This proposal has the promise to lead to targeted, tailored interventions for infants most at-risk for obesity, ensuring that prevention efforts are deployed in an efficient, cost-effective manner and accepted by those who need them.",Obesity Prevention in Early Life (OPEL): Risk Screening and Targeted Intervention,9912764,K01DK114383,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Award ', ' Belief ', ' Birth Certificates

"Human Newborn Energy Homeostasis Brain Networks And Infant Adiposity This revised application, submitted in response to NIH PA-18-741 “Secondary Analyses in Obesity,  Diabetes, and Digestive and Kidney Diseases,” relates to the public health problem of childhood  obesity, with a specific focus on the characterization, determinants and role of energy balance  homeostasis-related brain circuitry in the human newborn. The proposal describes a comprehensive  plan designed to advance neonatal MRI analytical methods, developmental systems neuroscience, and  fetal programming of health and disease risk. The critical importance of the  hypothalamic-limbic-cortical brain circuitry that regulates energy homeostasis is well  established, and MRI-based measures of energy homeostasis-related brain circuits have been  associated with obesity outcomes. However, it is unclear whether the observed differences in these  brain regions and circuitry in obese relative to normal-weight individuals are a cause,  consequence, or both, of the obese state. Moreover, relatively little is known about the  developmental ontogeny of these brain regions and circuitry, particularly during the fetal period,  and their prospective role in shaping propensity for childhood obesity. This project addresses  this fundamental knowledge gap. We will develop novel measures and conduct analyses using newborn  brain imaging and other data elements from 4 inter-linked NIH-funded projects on prenatal stress  and fetal programming of brain development and infant body composition (R01 HD-060628; R01  MH-091351; R01 HD-065825; UG3 OD-023349). The importance of selecting the newborn brain as the  starting time point derives from the logic that brain circuitry at this time could not yet have  been influenced by postnatal factors such as diet/feeding, thereby enabling the study to  disentangle the temporality of effects. In a recent position paper on the pathogenesis of obesity,  the U.S. Endocrine Society emphasized the need to conceptualize obesity as a disorder of the  energy homeostasis system and elucidate its underlying mechanisms and developmental influences.  Towards this objective, and using a population of ~100 mother-infant dyads followed from early  gestation through birth till 5 yrs age, we will integrate research aims that leverage the resources  of these projects to advance our understanding of the origins of childhood obesity. Aim 1.  Develop measures of energy homeostasis brain circuitry using anatomical, diffusion and functional  MRI. Because such measures have not yet been established in newborn homeostasis circuitry,  this aim will fulfill an important need in terms of not only scientific knowledge but also  technical capability. Aim 2. Address the physiological relevance and clinical significance of these  novel MRI-based newborn brain measures by testing the hypothesis that measures of the human  newborn’s energy homeostasis brain circuitry are prospectively associated with infant adiposity  and subsequent childhood obesity risk. Aim 3. Identify the prenatal (gestational biology)  determinants of variation in the measures of newborn brain energy homeostasis circuitry that are  associated with infant adiposity. Significance. By identifying the role and determinants of  energy homeostasis-related brain circuitry in the human newborn, these findings will ultimately  provide the basis for the subsequent development of strategies aimed at the primary prevention of  childhood obesity. This proposal describes a comprehensive plan to conduct research that aims to identify  novel MRI-based measures of energy homeostasis-related brain circuitry in the human newborn,  determine the prospective association of these measures with subsequent risk for childhood  obesity, and identify their gestational biology determinants. The identification of brain-related  biomarkers of childhood obesity risk that predate the influence of the obesogenic environment  will contribute to an improved understanding of the neurological underpinnings of obesity, early  identification of at-risk individuals, and intervention targets for primary prevention.",Human Newborn Energy Homeostasis Brain Networks And Infant

"Automated Assessment of Neurodevelopment in Infants at Risk for Motor Disability PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The overall goal of this R01 project is to develop an automated assessment system that can capitalize on state of the art sensing technologies and machine learning algorithms to enable accurate and early detection of infants at risk for neurodevelopmental disabilities. In the USA, 1 in 10 infants are born at risk for these disabilities. For children with neurodevelopmental disabilities, early treatment in the first year of life improves long-term outcomes. However, we are currently held back by inadequacies of available clinical tests to measure and predict impairment. Existing tests are hard to administer, require specialized training, and have limited long- term predictive value. There is a critical need to develop an objective, accurate, easy-to-use tool for the early prediction of long-term physical disability. The field of pediatrics and infant development would greatly benefit from a quantitative score that would correlate with existing clinical measures used today to detect movement impairments in very young infants. To realize a new generation of tests that will be easy to administer, we will obtain large datasets of infants playing in an instrumented gym or simply being recorded while moving in a supine posture. Video and sensor data analyses will convert movement into feature vectors based on our knowledge of the problem domain. Our approach will use machine learning to relate these feature vectors to currently recommended clinical tests or other ground truth information. The power of this design is that algorithms can utilize many aspects of movement to produce the relevant scores. Our preliminary data allows us to lay the following aims: 1)Aim 1: To assess concurrent validity of a multimodal instrumented gym with existing clinical tools. Here, using 150 infants (75 with early brain injury and 75 controls), we will focus on converting data from an instrumented gym into estimates of the standard clinical tests; 2)Aim 2: To develop a computer vision-based algorithm to quantify infant motor performance from single camera video. Here using video data from 1200 infants (400 with early brain injury, 400 preterm without early brain injury, 400 controls), plus those gathered from Aim 1 and Aim 3, we will extract pose data from single-camera video recordings and convert these into kinematic features and relevant scores needed to classify infant movement; 3)Aim3: To discover the features related to long-term motor development. Here we will convert data collected longitudinally from 50 infants (25 with early brain injury and 25 controls) using both instrumented gym and video recordings into estimates standard clinical tests change over time and track features over developmental timescales. These three aims spearhead the use of real world behavior for movement scoring. Our aims will bring us closer to a universal non-invasive test for early detection of neurodevelopmental disabilities and lay the groundwork for long-term prediction of disability. But above all, it promises to scale to infants worldwide, producing an affordable tool to aid in infant health assessment. NARRATIVE Increased survival rates of medically fragile infants lead to an increased number of children with functional impairments later in life. Early detection of motor delays or impairments provides the opportunity for early treatment which improves health outcomes. This study will use state of the art sensors combined with machine learning approaches to develop objective, accurate, easy-to-use tools for the early scoring of deficits and lays the foundation for the early prediction of physical disability.",Automated Assessment of Neurodevelopment in Infants at Risk for Motor Disability,9993993,R01HD097686,"['Algorithms ', ' Asphyxia ', ' Suffocation ', ' asphyxiation ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Behavior ', ' Birth History ', ' Calibration ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Educational Status ', ' Educational Achievement ', ' educational level ', ' training achievement ', ' training level ', ' training status ', ' Limb structure ', ' Extremities ', ' Limbs ', ' Non-Trunk ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' Hydrocephalus ', ' Hydrocephaly ', ' hydrocephalic ', ' Infant ', ' Infection ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Neuronal Plasticity ', ' CNS plasticity ', ' central nervous system plasticity ', ' neural plasticity ', ' neuroplastic ', ' neuroplasticity ', ' Pediatrics ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Play ', ' Posture ', ' pressure ', ' Risk ', ' Seizures ', ' Supination ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Toy ', ' Translating ', ' Video Recording ', ' Videorecording ', ' video recording system ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Developmental Delay ', ' Specific Child Development Disorders ', ' Developmental Delay Disorders ', ' physical disability ', ' physically disabled ', ' physically handicapped ', ' Prematurely delivering ', ' Preterm Birth ', ' premature childbirth ', ' premature delivery ', ' preterm delivery ', ' Premature Birth ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Infant Development ', ' Infant Health ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Intuition ', ' school age ', ' School-Age Population ', ' Grip strength ', ' Hand Strength ', ' Acquired brain injury ', ' brain damage ', ' brain-injured ', ' Brain Injuries ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' instrument ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' skeletal ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Performance ', ' Neural Development ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' kinematic model ', ' kinematics ', ' Early identification ', ' Functional impairment ', ' functional disability ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Age-Months ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Monitor ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' vector ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Neurodevelopmental Disability ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' functional outcomes ', ' infant measurement ', ' infant monitoring ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' Impairment ', ' early therapy ', ' Early treatment ', ' movement impairment ', ' movement limitation ', ' motor impairment ', ' motor control ', ' critical period ', ' multi-modality ', ' multimodality ', ' screening ', ' prognostic tool ', ' neonatal stroke ', ' drug use in pregnancy ', ' drugs used while pregant ', ' pregnant drug abuser ', ' prenatal drug use ', ' drug abuse in pregnancy ', ' recruit ', ' sensing technology ', ' sensor technology ', ' early screening ', ' health assessment ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' large data sets ', ' large datasets ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,670354,PA-03,0.14505174445388455
