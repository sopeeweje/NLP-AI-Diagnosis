"Neural Encoding of Internal Motivational States and Goal-Directed Actions    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this proposal is to provide advanced training in behavioral electrophysiology, while performing experiments to determine how internal motivational states are encoded in cortical-basal ganglia circuits. The proposed training program combines hands-on experience performing experimental investigations of single neuron activity with additional coursework in data analysis and statistical techniques, in a world-class environment for the scientific study of motivation.  Flexible, adaptive decision-making requires the use of information provided both by external environmental cues and internal motivational states. Altered motivational states and their influence over responses to external stimuli are central to variety of abnormal human conditions including depression, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, eating disorders and obesity, which have a tremendous impact on society. An enhanced understanding of the neural correlates of internal motivation within cortical-basal ganglia circuits would greatly inform models of normal decision-making, and provide important insights into abnormal decision-making processes in human behavioral disorders.  This proposal uses electrophysiology to explore how the activity of individual neurons and subpopulations in key brain regions is modulated by the organism's state of hunger or thirst. Internal motivation will be manipulated by selective food or water deprivation, and assessed by examining choices between these different goals during operant task performance. Recordings of single unit activity will be made in ventral striatum (VS), dorsal striatum (DS) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). The experiment design allows the determination of how neuronal firing reflects coding of either specific actions, specific goals (outcomes), the current value assigned to task performance (motivational drive), or combinations of these factors. Although there have been extensive prior studies of the role of value in neural representations, there has been little investigation of how deprivation state influences these core circuits for translating motivation into action.  Aim 1: To compare distinct neuronal coding of actions, goals and motivational drive in multiple striatal subregions and OFC. In brief, the major hypothesis is that action-coding will be dominant in dorsal- lateral striatum, goal-coding in dorsal-medial striatum, and drive-coding in ventral striatum. We also expect to see specific combinations of these factors such as the previously reported action-value coding.  Aim 2: To test theories of hierarchical behavioral control by examining the duration of task- related cell responses. We hypothesize that drive-coding networks organize goal-coding networks that in turn organize action-coding networks. We predict that neurons that are most strongly modulated by deprivation state will show a more prolonged response within each trial compared to neurons that principally care about specific outcomes, while action-coding neurons show the most time-limited pattern of firing.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Altered motivational states and their influence over behavior underlie a variety of abnormal human conditions such as depression, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, eating disorders and obesity, all of which have a tremendous impact on society.

"The Role of LFP Spatial Structure in the Hippocampus    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of this work is to understand how the activity of neurons is coordinated within the hippocampus, a brain region involved in the storage of memories. One manifestation of this coordination is the local field potential (LFP), the summed electrical activity of a small volume of neural tissue. Recently, multi- electrode arrays (MEAs) have enabled the simultaneous measurement of LFPs and single-neuron activity from multiple sites within the brain of an animal as it performs a task. This advance motivates the development of new computational methods that can identify the relationships that exist within these rich, large data sets. The temporal structure of hippocampal LFPs is known to correlate with single-neuron activity, as well as with behavioral state. In contrast, the spatial structure of these LFPs remains relatively unexplored. An interesting example of this spatial structure are the traveling LFP waves that propagate through the hippocampus. This project will examine whether the spatial dynamics of the hippocampal LFP influence neuronal activity and its relationship to behavior. Its aims are 1) to identify a parsimonious model for explaining the observed spatio- temporal structure in the LFP; 2) to investigate the relationship of LFP structure to single-neuron activity; and 3) to understand how LFP structure governs circuit-level neuronal processing within the hippocampus. To achieve these goals, this project will employ statistical learning techniques to extract spatio-temporal regularities from within the LFP, and use predictive models to examine the influence of different LFP structures on the population activity of hippocampal neurons. This work will identify concise metrics that capture the richness of high-dimensional hippocampal LFP measurements. Furthermore, it will examine the utility of incorporating complex dynamical features into current models of hippocampal processing. This work may help understand how distortions in electrical activity within the hippocampus lead to conditions such as epilepsy and amnesia. It will evaluate the suitability of the LFP as a direct target for neuroprosthetic interventions. Finally, it may lead to screening procedures for rapidly finding potential abnormalities in patients' brain activity, and help understand the implications of such abnormalities for patients' lifestyles.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to develop a more complete description of the electrical waves of activity found in the hippocampus, a region of the brain that stores memories. These waves exhibit spatial patterns that may help guide the proper function of the hippocampus. This work could potentially explain how distortions in electrical activity relate to defects in people's abilities to form and recall memories.              Project Narrative The goal of this project is to develop a more complete description of the electrical waves of activity found in the hippocampus, a region of the brain that stores memories.

"Intracranial EEG for Neuronal Oscillatory Contingency during Cognitive Tasks    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Brain computer interfaces (BCI) involving motor and sensory systems have been successful in restoring function and in improving the lives of patients with neurological diseases. These devices, ranging from deep brain stimulators for Parkinson's disease to more involved devices capable of recapitulating motor function, are becoming increasingly available with recent technological advances and with a greater understanding of underlying neural circuitry. A major area not addressed by these devices is that of higher cognitive functions, such as memory and executive planning. Here, we propose to use intracranial electrocorticographic signals, captured from subdural and depth electrodes implanted in patients with pharmacologically intractable epilepsy, to extend the role of BCIs to the cognitive domain. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the patterns of neuronal activity that underlie memory storage and recall can be used to adjust stimulus presentation in a cognitive task to augment learning. We propose to develop a BCI that measures and analyzes intracranial neural activity in real time as patients engage in a free recall task, a standard method of measuring one's ability to encode and retrieve episodic memories. Using machine-learning algorithms, we will identify the precise spatiotemporal patterns of electrophysiological brain activity that lead to optimal memory formation. We will compute these patterns separately for each patient. Our system will thus adapt to each individual's brain activity. To close the functional loop between the patient's brain and our system, we will take advantage of these naturally occurring optimal spatiotemporal patterns for memory formation and trigger stimulus presentation on their presence. Animal studies have shown that by presenting stimuli contingent on the oscillatory state of the hippocampus, learning rates can be improved. We hope to demonstrate that conditioning stimulus presentation on the presence of these optimal spatiotemporal patterns of neural activity will improve both memory storage and recall in our patients as well. Such a demonstration will establish a causative, rather than correlational, relationship between these patterns of activity and memory encoding. Furthermore, our research will extend the domain of BCIs to the realm of cognition and memory, and lay the groundwork for a range of BCI systems that can enhance a wide variety of human cognitive functions.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Brain computer interfaces (BCIs) are machines that directly interface with the brain by measuring and analyzing neural activity in real time. Recent BCIs have played an integral role in rehabilitating patients suffering from Parkinson's disease, severe depression, and epilepsy. One critical area not addressed by BCIs to date is that of higher cognitive functions, including memory -- one of the major deficits in a number of neural diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. Here we propose a novel BCI for improving memory performance both in memory-impaired and cognitively normal individuals.           Brain computer interfaces (BCIs) are machines that directly interface with the brain by measuring and analyzing neural activity in real time.

"Scalable Assays for Morphological Analysis of Mammalian Neurons    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medium and high-throughput assays (i.e., screens) have generally not been applied to mammalian neurons because of the difficulties in culturing them in large numbers and because of the low efficiency with which the genetic makeup of neurons can be altered. Furthermore, because many aspects of neuronal function can only be assayed with electrophysiological assays, follow-up analysis and validation of screening hits is difficult. We propose to use automated imaging approaches to analyze synapse number and neuronal structure in vitro in a scalable format. We have implemented tissue culture and immunostaining approaches to monitor the number and types of synapses formed onto neurons in multi-well plates. We will couple this analysis with lentivirus mediated introduction of short-hairpin RNAs to induce RNA interference against genes expressed in neurons. This will be performed in concert with transcriptional analysis of neurons to determine the key changes in gene expression that correlate with structural and synaptic changes. The proposal represents a significant collaboration between several groups with expertise in functional analysis of neurons, automated analysis of images, viral mediated manipulation of gene expression, and whole-genome transcriptional analysis. We hope that our work will lead, for the first time, to a turn-key and robust method of analysis of neuron and synapse structure suitable for scalable, whole-genome analysis.

"The Role of LFP Spatial Structure in the Hippocampus    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of this work is to understand how the activity of neurons is coordinated within the hippocampus, a brain region involved in the storage of memories. One manifestation of this coordination is the local field potential (LFP), the summed electrical activity of a small volume of neural tissue. Recently, multi- electrode arrays (MEAs) have enabled the simultaneous measurement of LFPs and single-neuron activity from multiple sites within the brain of an animal as it performs a task. This advance motivates the development of new computational methods that can identify the relationships that exist within these rich, large data sets. The temporal structure of hippocampal LFPs is known to correlate with single-neuron activity, as well as with behavioral state. In contrast, the spatial structure of these LFPs remains relatively unexplored. An interesting example of this spatial structure are the traveling LFP waves that propagate through the hippocampus. This project will examine whether the spatial dynamics of the hippocampal LFP influence neuronal activity and its relationship to behavior. Its aims are 1) to identify a parsimonious model for explaining the observed spatio- temporal structure in the LFP; 2) to investigate the relationship of LFP structure to single-neuron activity; and 3) to understand how LFP structure governs circuit-level neuronal processing within the hippocampus. To achieve these goals, this project will employ statistical learning techniques to extract spatio-temporal regularities from within the LFP, and use predictive models to examine the influence of different LFP structures on the population activity of hippocampal neurons. This work will identify concise metrics that capture the richness of high-dimensional hippocampal LFP measurements. Furthermore, it will examine the utility of incorporating complex dynamical features into current models of hippocampal processing. This work may help understand how distortions in electrical activity within the hippocampus lead to conditions such as epilepsy and amnesia. It will evaluate the suitability of the LFP as a direct target for neuroprosthetic interventions. Finally, it may lead to screening procedures for rapidly finding potential abnormalities in patients' brain activity, and help understand the implications of such abnormalities for patients' lifestyles.

"Automatic 3D Quantification of Synapse Distribution in Complex Dendritic Arbor     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The subcellular distribution of synapses is critical for the assembly, function, and plasticity of the nervous system and plays a role in its disorders. Underlying molecular mechanisms, however, remain largely unknown. While advanced multidimensional images, in conjunction with single-cell genetic techniques, have afforded an unprecedented opportunity to understand synapse development at a new level, there is a knowledge gap in our capacity to effectively quantify subcellular synapses from large quantities of three-dimensional images. This is a significant problem and has hampered large-scale studies of the molecular mechanisms of synapse development, especially in neurons with complex arbor-such as Purkinje cells in mammals and lobula plate tangential cells (LPTC) in Drosophila-where existing approaches do not yield complete or robust synapse quantification for the entire dendritic tree and do not scale to efficient genetic screening. The objective of thi project is to bridge this gap by providing tools for quantitative investigation of subcellular synapse distribution and its molecular mechanisms using three-dimensional microscopy images. Specifically, our highly cross- disciplinary team will pursue two aims: (1) Develop automatic algorithms to analyze and quantify synapse distribution in the entire dendritic tree of neurons with complex arbor. Holistic and objective description of synapse density will enable automatic detection of mutant patterns. (2) Develop automatic algorithms to analyze and quantify synapse distribution in different parts of the entire dendritic tree of neurons with complex arbor. Efficient quantification at distinct subcellular locations will assist discovery of novel regulators for different subcellular parts. As a test case, we will use synapse distribution n Drosophila LPTC neurons, which are amenable to both genome-wide genetic screens and genetic manipulations with single-neuron resolution. We will develop reliable methods to characterize the density of inhibitory GABAergic and excitatory cholinergic synapses from three-dimensional fluorescence confocal images. Our algorithms will lead to the next level of mechanistic understanding that controls the subcellular distribution of inhibitory and excitatory synapses, and enable a wide range of quantitative analyses for other types of neurons with similar complexity. Powerful multichannel co-analysis and machine learning approaches will be used to improve synapse detection and subcellular compartment extraction for overcoming challenges in 3D confocal image, including staining artifacts and anisotropic resolution. Algorithms will be developed using a model-guided methodology that emphasizes efficiency for large volume 3D images during genetic screening. Pattern-recognition methods will be used to speed up proofreading of the synapse quantification results. A novel ordering strategy will be adapted for neurons of complex dendritic arbor to quantify subcellular synapses in a functionally meaningful way. The project will produce a set of open-source, extensible tools for automatic synapse quantification and proofreading, with friendly graphical-user interfaces, to serve the neuroscience community.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The underlying molecular mechanisms for the subcellular distribution of synapses remain largely unknown, which hinders the discovery of novel therapies for many neurological disorders. By developing new, efficient automatic algorithms and open-source tools for quantifying synapses in neurons, this research intends to advance the capacity to effectively analyze large quantities of three-dimensional neuronal images, especially those of complex dendritic arbor.

"Experimental examinations of the mechanisms that generate the responses of midbra     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) play central roles in learning and motivation. In tasks involving rewards, they respond in a stereotyped fashion. They are activated by unpredicted rewards. But when a sensory cue predicts reward, they instead start responding to the cue, while their response to reward attenuates. Moreover, when a predicted reward is omitted, their activity is transiently suppressed. From these observations, it has been postulated that dopamine neurons signal discrepancies between expected and actual reward, i.e., they compute the reward prediction error (RPE). However, it remains unknown how dopamine neurons compute RPE. To understand this question, it is important to know (1) what mechanisms suppress dopamine neurons' responses to reward when the reward is expected, and (2) what mechanisms are responsible for generating the response of dopamine neurons to reward-predicting cues. A previous study in our laboratory has shown that VTA GABA neurons exhibit sustained activations during the delay between a reward-predictive cue and reward. This result suggests that VTA GABA neurons suppress dopamine neurons' responses to reward when the reward is expected. In this proposal, to test this idea experimentally, the sustained activity of VTA GABA neurons will be optogenetically manipulated, and how this manipulation affects dopamine neurons' responses to reward will be examined electrophysiologically. Second, although previous studies have shown that the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and the ventral pallidum(VP) provide large numbers of inhibitory inputs to dopamine neurons, and NAc neurons project to VP, the exact roles of these connections in regulating the activity of dopamine neurons remain unclear. In a preliminary experiment, inactivation of unilateral NAc was found to greatly reduce dopamine neurons' responses to reward-predictive cues. We will experimentally test the hypothesis that a disynaptic, inhibitory pathway from NAc to VP to dopamine neurons is responsible in generating dopamine neurons' responses to reward-predictive cues. In total, this project aims to experimentally test the aforementioned specific hypotheses using integrative approaches in mice. Malfunctions of the dopamine system are associated with a variety of pathological conditions including depression, schizophrenia and addiction. By providing a detailed, circuit-level analysis of dopamine neuron firing, we will provide a framework for understanding how the brain learns from rewards, and how this system can be disrupted in disease.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Malfunction of the midbrain dopamine system is associated with a variety of pathological conditions including depression, schizophrenia and addiction. Understanding neural circuits that regulate dopamine neurons will deepen our understanding of the etiology of these diseases and aid in the design of preventive and therapeutic approaches.            ",Experimental examinations of the mechanisms that generate the responses of midbra,8558913,R01MH101207,"['Stereotyping ', ' synapse ', ' Synaptic ', ' Synapses ', ' Teaching ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Testing ', ' Molecular Genetics ', ' ventral tegmentum ', ' Ventral Tegmental Area ', ' base ', ' Synaptic Terminals ', ' Synaptic Boutons ', ' Presynaptic Nerve Endings ', ' Axon Terminals ', ' Presynaptic Terminals ', ' Agonist ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Attenuated ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' receptor ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Dopamine neuron ', ' DA Neuron ', ' dopaminergic neuron ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Inhibitory Synapse ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' behavioral disinhibition ', ' Disinhibition ', ' mouse model ', ' addictive disorder ', ' addiction ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' dopamine system ', ' public health relevance ', ' optogenetics ', ' Affect ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Pavlovian conditioning ', ' Associative Learning ', ' classical conditioning ', ' Cues ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Exhibits ', ' foot ', ' GABA ', ' Aminalone ', ' Aminalon ', ' 4-amino-butanoic acid ', ' 4-Aminobutyric Acid ', ' 4-Aminobutanoic Acid ', ' gamma-Aminobutyric Acid ', ' pallidum ', ' Globus Pallidus ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' Midbrain ', ' Mid-brain ', ' Mesencephalon ', ' Midbrain structure ', ' Motivation ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' Pantherine ', ' Agarin ', ' 3(2H)-Isoxazolone, 5-(aminomethyl)- ', ' Muscimol ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' Nucleus Accumbens ', ' Odors ', ' Play ', ' Rabies virus ', ' Rewards ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' ']",NIMH,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,R01,2013,413444,MA-05,0.06444000631820328

"A MOLECULAR CODE FOR CONNECTIVITY IN THE NEOCORTEX     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The neocortex consists of billions of neurons with trillions of connections, and is responsible for cognitive tasks such as perception and abstract reasoning. Cortical abnormalities are associated with devastating neuropsychiatric illnesses including autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia, further underscoring the importance of understanding how the cortex functions. Despite major advances in understanding the properties of individual neurons, we are just beginning to understand the rules that govern the assembly of neocortical circuits.  One major unanswered question in the field is whether molecular mechanisms direct the wiring diagram of neural circuits at the level of individual cells. In other words, is there a genetic blue print that governs the local wiring of cortical circuits? Tis question is technically challenging to address because it will require simultaneous analysis of both neuronal connectivity and the gene expression profile at the level of single cortical neurons. Moreover, it will require massive amounts of data to be collected as well as advanced analysis techniques to crack the molecular code of connectivity. We propose to use multi-whole-cell patch clamp recording combined with single-cell reverse transcription (RT)-PCR to investigate whether the clustered protocadherin gene family provides a molecular code for neural circuit assembly. The clustered protocadherins have been shown to be expressed in a combinatorial code in individual neurons, are highly expressed during synaptogenesis, and localize to synapses. Thus, clustered protocadherins are the leading candidate molecules for shaping neocortical circuits. However, their role in instructing specific synapse formation has not been directly tested due to the difficulty of these types of experiments. Furthermore, the challenging aspects of this project make it unlikely to be funded by more traditional mechanisms. The results of these experiments could revolutionize our understanding of neural circuit assembly and lead to a more principled approach to studying neuropsychiatric disorders at the circuit level.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study aims to test the hypothesis that there is a molecular code that governs the connectivity of cortical circuits. Abnormal connectivity in neocortical networks is thought to underlie many neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and autism spectrum disorder. Discovering the molecular code of connectivity in the cortex will provide us with the genetic blue print to study how cortical circuits are assembled and promises to also provide a paradigm shift for studying neuropsychiatric disorders at the circuit level.                ",A MOLECULAR CODE FOR CONNECTIVITY IN THE NEOCORTEX,8639755,R01MH103108,"['abstracting ', ' Adhesions ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Cells ', ' Cognition ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Exhibits ', ' Gene Expression ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Neurologic Organ System ', ' Neurologic Body System ', ' Nervous System ', ' Nervous system structure ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' Perception ', ' Printing ', ' gene product ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Reverse Transcription ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' synapse ', ' Synaptic ', ' Synapses ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' neopallium ', ' isocortex ', ' homotypical cortex ', ' Neocortex ', ' base ', ' genetic manipulation ', ' Clinical ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Genetic ', ' Shapes ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Brain Part ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Isoforms ', ' Protein Isoforms ', ' synapse formation ', ' synaptogenesis ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' neuropsychiatric ', ' neuropsychiatry ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Property ', ' patch clamp ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Binding (Molecular Function) ', ' Address ', ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Cognitive ', ' Gene Family ', ' Molecular ', ' transcriptome ', ' gene expression signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' cost ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' combinatorial ', ' neocortical ', ' brain research ', ' information processing ', ' public health relevance ', ' molecular marker ', ' RNA-seq ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' ']",NIMH,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2013,313000,TX-09,-0.15032167339140134
"Scalable Assays for Morphological Analysis of Mammalian Neurons    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medium and high-throughput assays (i.e., screens) have generally not been applied to mammalian neurons because of the difficulties in culturing them in large numbers and because of the low efficiency with which the genetic makeup of neurons can be altered. Furthermore, because many aspects of neuronal function can only be assayed with electrophysiological assays, follow-up analysis and validation of screening hits is difficult. We propose to use automated imaging approaches to analyze synapse number and neuronal structure in vitro in a scalable format. We have implemented tissue culture and immunostaining approaches to monitor the number and types of synapses formed onto neurons in multi-well plates. We will couple this analysis with lentivirus mediated introduction of short-hairpin RNAs to induce RNA interference against genes expressed in neurons. This will be performed in concert with transcriptional analysis of neurons to determine the key changes in gene expression that correlate with structural and synaptic changes. The proposal represents a significant collaboration between several groups with expertise in functional analysis of neurons, automated analysis of images, viral mediated manipulation of gene expression, and whole-genome transcriptional analysis. We hope that our work will lead, for the first time, to a turn-key and robust method of analysis of neuron and synapse structure suitable for scalable, whole-genome analysis. Such a system will permit the unbiased and systematic analysis of pathways involved in neuropsychiatric diseases including neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's as well as neurodevelopmental disorders such as mental retardation and autism.        Massively parallel analysis of cells in many conditions has allowed the discovery of key pathways that control cell function.

"Synapse Elimination during Development: Pruning Rates, Models, and Diseases     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many neural circuits are formed using a two-stage developmental process that includes an initial period of exuberant synapse formation, followed by a longer period of activity-dependent synapse elimination. While pruning has been well-documented in many organisms and brain regions, little attention has been paid to the rate at which synapses are eliminated during development. Different pruning rates have a strong effect on the quality and plasticity of the resulting neural circuits, and indeed, many neurological diseases have been linked to abnormal synapse levels in the cortex during critical developmental periods.  We hypothesize that pruning rates in the cortex have been optimized to achieve both connectivity and robustness of underlying neural circuits. To test our hypothesis, we propose a joint experimental-computational research plan to explore how synapse levels change during development and how these changes manifest at the network and phenotypic levels. First, we will quantify the precise rate of synapse elimination during development of the mouse barrel cortex using a specialized electron microscopy (EM) preparation that selectively stains for synapses. We will develop a fully-automated and high-throughput image processing pipeline that will allow us to count tens of thousands of synapses per time point and gain robust statistics of pruning rates and the time of peak synapse density. Second, we will develop computational models of synaptic pruning to evaluate how pruning rates affect information processing in neural circuits. Our computational experiments will explore how sparse circuits emerge that are capable of efficient and robust encoding, while still being flexible enough for plasticity and adaptation and while meeting metabolic costs. Our models will also help us answer questions about global neural circuitry, including whether hubs are likely to exist and how functional modules are formed. Third, we will examine cases of synapse rewiring and reorganization following abnormal developmental conditions. We will repeat our EM procedure using mouse models of Fragile X syndrome and Rett syndrome to compare synapse levels with respect to control, and we will extend our computational models to understand circuit-level differences in these conditions.  The proposed project will generate new computational and experimental solutions for analyzing network development and will lead to biological insights into how local pruning mechanisms affect global circuit properties.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Many neurodevelopmental disorders, such as Fragile X syndrome (Autism) and Rett syndrome, are believed to be caused by faulty developmental processes in the brain.

"Neuron and Glial Cellular Signatures from Normal and Diseased iPS Cells     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a critical need to define the state and predict the behavior of human brain cells in health and disease. The number of different cell types in the CNS remains undefined, and despite a demographically ordained wave of neurodegenerative diseases, not a single disease-modifying therapy exists. Our  knowledge of the CNS and the foundation for intervening rationally in disease would be dramatically  advanced by generating quantitative molecular phenotypes essentially cell signatures of human neurons,  astrocytes and oligodendrocytes from healthy people and from patients with motor neuron disease,  Huntington's disease, and Parkinson's disease. The CNS is so unique that studying non-neuronal cells does not provide much assistance. Despite this desperate need, the inaccessibility of human brain cells meant studying them would have been impossible until the recent discovery of cellular reprogramming and induced pluripotent stem cell technology.  Here we propose to form the NeuroLINCS consortium to accomplish these goals. We have handpicked the team to bring in critical expertise in iPSC technology, disease modeling, transcriptomics, epigenomics, metabolomics, whole genome sequencing, proteomics, high content, high throughput longitudinal single cell analysis, other cell-based assays, bioinformatics, statistics and computational biology. In addition, we are collaborating with Google to bring in special expertise in machine learning and the integration of signatures across platforms into highly predictive models of responses to perturbagens. Together, we expect to develop cell signatures of an array of human brain cell types under different conditions that should be broadly applicable to the LINCs community. We also anticipate generating innovative software tools and approaches that will make the signature generating process cheaper, faster, and more reliable.  Besides the unique combination of expertise represented within NeuroLINCS, another distinguishing feature is the long track record that its members have of collaborating with each other. That collaborative spirit will be expressed in NeuroLINCS through its significant and multifaceted community outreach programs. These will involve specific and detailed plans to make the data and tools that NeuroLINCS generates available to the community, to interact with other LINCS sites, and to prepare for DCIC and the prospect of disseminating knowledge and resources at scale.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The cellular signatures of human neurons we identify can be used to provide insights into the molecular factors that distinguish central neurons from healthy people from those of patients with neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS, SMA, PD and HD.

"CRCNS: Computational and neural mechanisms of memory-guided decisions DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): What aspects of previous experiences guide decisions? Much research concerns how the brain computes the average, over many experiences, of rewards received for an option. But such a summary - produced by prominent models of dopaminergic incremental learning- is chiefly useful for repetitive tasks. Much less is understood about how the brain can flexibly evaluate new or changing options in more realistic tasks, which must rely on less aggregated information. This application argues that this is fundamentally a function of memory, so this project looks to the brain's memories for the most individuated experiences - episodes - to seek new computational, cognitive and neural mechanisms that could support more flexible decisions. The overarching hypothesis is that episodic memory, supported by the hippocampus, plays a central role in guiding flexible decision making and complements the wellknown role of dopaminergic and striatal systems in incremental learning of value.  What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity? By connecting the computational neuroscience of decision making with the cognitive neuroscience of memory, and bringing together collaborators from each area, this project promises to shed light on both areas. This is because the neural mechanisms supporting episodic memory are well studied, but less so their contribution to adaptive behavior. Computationally, episodic memories can support a family of learning algorithms that draw on sparse, individual experiences, such as Monte Carlo and kernel methods. These suggest novel, plausible hypotheses for how the brain solves more realistic decision problems, and in particular how it implements ""goal-directed"" or ""model-based"" choices. The proposed studies aim to differentiate the contributions of incremental and episodic learning to value-based decisions, and test to what extent episodic memories contribute to decisions previously identified as model-based. Our hypotheses are tested fitting computational models to neural activity from functional MRI experiments in humans, and also to choice behavior in healthy individuals compared to patients with isolated damage to specific neural systems. This combination of computational, neuroimaging and neuropsychological approaches permits finely tracing the trial-by-trial dynamics of learning as reflected both in brain activity nd behavior, and also testing the causal role of particular brain regions in these same processes.  What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity? A striking range of psychiatric and neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and eating disorders, are accompanied by aberrant decision-making and by dysfunction in circuitry central to this proposal, such as striatal and fronto-temporal mechanisms. But understanding such dysfunction requires a better understanding of how each of these circuits separately influences decisions. A focus on untangling multiple decision systems is particularly pertinent to disorders such as drug abuse, which is hypothesized to center on the compromise of incremental reinforcement mechanisms that may support more habitual actions and underlie the compulsive nature of such diseases. At the same time, drugs may also weaken or compromise more deliberative or goal-directed choice systems that might otherwise be able to support more advantageous decisions. Formally understanding the roles played by both of these influences, and how they interact, promises to improve the conceptualization, diagnosis, and treatment of these and other disorders. The proposed program also provides unique opportunities for training and education. By integrating multiple core tools of systems and cognitive neuroscience (computational modeling, functional imaging, patient studies, behavioral analyses), students in the labs of both PIs are trained in different approaches to a unified research question, preparing them to be effective scientists in a more interdisciplinary future. Components of this training will also be extended to undergraduate and high school student populations through existing programs at both NYU and at Columbia and through outreach to New York area schools. This project will also help promote broader representation of minorities in science, including women. As a female neuroscientist with many women trainees in her laboratory, PI Shohamy serves as a role model and the collaborative project facilitates training for women in computational neuroscience, an area in which women are particularly underrepresented. Drug abuse is acquired through learning. Much research focuses on the involvement of dopaminergic  incremental learning processes. But other learning and memory systems are likely to also contribute to  aspects, such as drug-seeking, not well explained by those mechanisms. By isolating the contribution of  different memory systems to learned choice, this project may help to guide future treatment strategies.",CRCNS: Computational and neural mechanisms of memory-guided decisions,8837113,R01DA038891,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Behavior ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Choice Behavior ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' striatal ', ' Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' Cues ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' abuses drugs ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' Drug abuse ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Eating Disorders ', ' Family ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hippocampus ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Memory ', ' Midbrain ', ' Mid-brain ', ' Mesencephalon ', ' Midbrain structure ', ' Monte Carlo simulation ', ' Monte Carlo procedure ', ' Monte Carlo calculation ', ' Monte Carlo algorithm ', ' Monte Carlo Method ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' neuropsychologic ', ' Neuropsychologies ', ' Neuropsychology ', ' New York ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Parkinsons disease ', "" Parkinson's disease "", "" Parkinson's "", ' Parkinson ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Lewy Body Parkinson Disease ', ' Idiopathic Parkinson Disease ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Reinforcement (Psychology) ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Research ', ' Rewards ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schools ', ' Science ', ' Specificity ', ' statistics ', ' Strikes ', ' Employee Strikes ', ' Students ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' adaptive behavior ', ' adaptation behavior ', ' Adaptive Behaviors ', ' Dissociation ', ' base ', ' computational neuroscience ', ' role model ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Training and Education ', ' Episodic memory ', ' experience ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' behavioral test ', ' behavior test ', ' outreach ', ' sorting ', ' Sorting - Cell Movement ', ' Modeling ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Physiologic Imaging ', ' Functional Imaging ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' neural mechanism ', ' neuromechanism ', ' cognitive neuroscience ', ' neuropsychological ', ' dopamine system ', ' treatment strategy ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' High School Student ', ' ']",NIDA,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,347054,NY-12,0.043312008693451226
"Defining cell types, lineage, and connectivity in developing human fetal cortex ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Little is currently known about the number, proportion, or lineage of distinct cell types in the developing human fetal brain. Knowledge of such a component list and its functional genomic foundations is crucial for understanding the function of this complex system, its evolution, and how it is disrupted in disease. We hypothesize that comprehensive single-cell mRNA expression profiles provide an accurate and efficient rubric for a first generation classification schema that can be integrated with lineage, morphology and connectivity. We will use unsupervised learning algorithms to cluster 10,000 single cell transcriptomes derived from RNAseq of the human fetal cortical anlage, providing an unbiased model to identify and understand the resultant cell classes. We will validate these cell class determinations using in situ hybridization. We will use marker genes identified in this analysis to perform lineage tracing using cell-type specific reporters engineered via genome editing, and obtain single cell transcriptional profiles at different stages of development to determine lineage relationships. Finally, we will analyze intact fetal cerebral hemispheres and mouse-human chimeras processed with the CLARITY technique to provide 3D localization and morphology of a subset of cell types. To markedly improve scalability of this approach, we will apply enhanced Bessel Beam Tomography for spectral image acquisition, increasing imaging speed by 2-3 orders of magnitude while maintaining high resolution. In parallel, we will develop automated image analysis algorithms to enable cell detection and comprehensive morphological assessment in an automated and correctable fashion. Overall, completion of these studies will permit, among many future advances: (1) The generation of an unbiased rubric of cell class based on integration of morphological, transcriptomic, and connectivity data used to understand cell type diversity and function; (2) Connection of cellular function, morphology, and connectivity to specific genes and proteins; (3) Refinement of the cellular basis of transcriptomic disease signatures and understanding of the individual cellular mechanisms of disease (4) The construction of connectivity diagrams based on discovered circuit components allowing development of realistic computational models of brain function and dysfunction; (5) Optimization of cell types generated by in vitro stem cell models based on gold standard in vivo cell class definition; and (6) Advancement of light microscopy techniques for rapid, spectral high resolution imaging of postmortem human and mouse brain including automated processing, which in addition to permitting high throughput brain mapping, will significantly advance mechanistic studies in mouse models and pathological studies in human. Completion of these aims will provide a proof of principle, multiple tools, and a core framework on which to build a more comprehensive knowledge of cell classes in the human brain.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Growing evidence implicates abnormalities in the development and architecture of the human cerebral cortex in neuropsychiatric illnesses such as autism and schizophrenia.

"Neural mechanisms for reducing interference during episodic memory formation     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One of the biggest challenges to successful remembering is the potential for confusion or interference between similar memories. For every password, name, or parking space that we store in memory, there are many other passwords, names or parking spaces that we have already learned or will learn in the future. While interference is a factor in relatively benign-yet annoying-examples of 'normal' forgetting, it is aso a major factor in clinically significant examples of forgetting that occur with aging and/or dementia. Thus, there is a fundamental need to understand the neural mechanisms that support the acquisition/retrieval of similar memories while minimizing interference and corresponding forgetting. Computational models of episodic memory have proposed two core mechanisms that are thought to reduce interference-related forgetting: integration and pattern separation. Integration involves 'fusing' overlapping memories into a common representation such that the relationship between these memories is more complementary than competitive. Pattern separation involves the orthogonalization of similar memories such that differences between memories are exaggerated and the potential for interference minimized. While there is general agreement that these mechanisms are theoretically appealing and offer clear computational advantages, clear evidence for how and when these learning mechanisms are invoked- particularly in humans-remains surprisingly limited? In particular, there remains ambiguity as far as (a) the learning contexts in which each mechanism might be recruited, (b) what the corresponding neural signatures of each mechanism are, and (c) the specific behavioral consequences associated with the engagement of each mechanism. We propose a systematic investigation of the contexts in which integration and pattern separation occur with the goal of using sophisticated, cutting-edge neuroimaging (fMRI) techniques to identify distributed patterns of neural activity that are diagnostic of each mechanism. Critically, we also plan to use these observed patterns of neural activity-that is, neural evidence for integration vs. separation-to predict behavioral memory phenomena, including interference-related forgetting. The research represents a strong synthesis of psychology and neuroscience questions with an emphasis on learning mechanisms inspired by computational models and analysis approaches that draw from the fields of machine learning and data mining.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A primary reason we forget is because we store a vast number of memories and interference between these memories becomes inevitable. While forgetting may represent only an occasional annoyance for most people, among older adults and those with dementia-groups that are growing at a disproportionate rate memory confusions and susceptibility to interference-related forgetting can be debilitating problems. The proposed research seeks to identify neural mechanisms that reduce interference-related forgetting and will develop neurodiagnostic tools that can be used to characterize memory processes and predict susceptibility to memory confusions and forgetting.            ",Neural mechanisms for reducing interference during episodic memory formation,8802305,R01NS089729,"['senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' Animals ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Mental Confusion ', ' Confusional State ', ' Confusion ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hippocampus ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Learning ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Names ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Psychology ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodent ', ' Testing ', ' base ', ' computational neuroscience ', ' Benign ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Episodic memory ', ' experience ', ' behavioral measurement ', ' behavioral measure ', ' behavior measurement ', ' forgetting ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' memory process ', ' neuroimaging ', ' Agreement ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' Address ', ' Retrieval ', ' Cognitive ', ' computational analysis ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' Behavioral ', ' neural mechanism ', ' neuromechanism ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinically significant ', ' memory encoding ', ' public health relevance ', ' neural patterning ', ' ']",NINDS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,306165,NY-12,0.04650537505108227
"Scalable Assays for Morphological Analysis of Mammalian Neurons    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medium and high-throughput assays (i.e., screens) have generally not been applied to mammalian neurons because of the difficulties in culturing them in large numbers and because of the low efficiency with which the genetic makeup of neurons can be altered. Furthermore, because many aspects of neuronal function can only be assayed with electrophysiological assays, follow-up analysis and validation of screening hits is difficult. We propose to use automated imaging approaches to analyze synapse number and neuronal structure in vitro in a scalable format. We have implemented tissue culture and immunostaining approaches to monitor the number and types of synapses formed onto neurons in multi-well plates. We will couple this analysis with lentivirus mediated introduction of short-hairpin RNAs to induce RNA interference against genes expressed in neurons. This will be performed in concert with transcriptional analysis of neurons to determine the key changes in gene expression that correlate with structural and synaptic changes. The proposal represents a significant collaboration between several groups with expertise in functional analysis of neurons, automated analysis of images, viral mediated manipulation of gene expression, and whole-genome transcriptional analysis. We hope that our work will lead, for the first time, to a turn-key and robust method of analysis of neuron and synapse structure suitable for scalable, whole-genome analysis. Such a system will permit the unbiased and systematic analysis of pathways involved in neuropsychiatric diseases including neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's as well as neurodevelopmental disorders such as mental retardation and autism.        Massively parallel analysis of cells in many conditions has allowed the discovery of key pathways that control cell function. Unfortunately, these techniques have not been applied to neurons due to difficulties in handling, manipulating, and analyzing large numbers of brain cells. We propose to develop imaging-based techniques to analyze neurons in dishes at a high throughput in order to find pathways that control their development and susceptibility to disease.

"Crowd coding in the brain:3D imaging and control of collective neuronal dynamics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The cortex is a laminated structure that is thought to underlie sequential information processing. Sensory input enters layer 4 (L4) from which activity quickly spreads to superficial layers 2/3 (L2/3) and deep layers 5/6 (L5/6) and other cortical areas eventually leading to appropriate motor responses. Sensory responses themselves depend on ongoing, i.e. spontaneous cortical activity, usually in the form of reverberating activit from within or distant cortical regions, as well as the state and behavioral context of the animal. Receptive field properties of neurons can rapidly and adaptively be reshaped when an animal is engaged in a behavioral task, indicating that encoding of stimuli is dependent on task- or context-dependent state. Responses also depend on ongoing cortical dynamics in a lamina-dependent fashion and differ between the awake and anesthetized state. The intricate neuronal interplay between behavioral context, ongoing activity, and sensory stimulus underlying cortical representations is unknown.  Specifically, we do not know how neuronal circuits shape these emergent dynamics within and between laminae, and we do not know which neurons encode which aspect of a sensory stimulus. One shortcoming of all prior studies of sensory processing is that only a few neurons are sampled, and thus information about the interactions between neurons, and between neuron and global brain state is lacking.  Here we address these challenges by developing new in vivo 2-photon imaging technology that allows rapid imaging and stimulation in multiple focal planes and new computational and information theoretic techniques to extract network dynamics at the single neuron and population level. These measures go beyond paired measures and take synergistic interactions between neurons into account. We use these new techniques to investigate the 3D single cell and population activity patterns in the auditory cortex in mice. We investigate the influence of single neurons relative to the synergistic influence of specific groups of neurons (the crowd) on network dynamics and ultimately behavior of the animal.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Functioning of the normal, healthy brain, such as in sensory processing and motor actions, depends on the precise interactions of millions of nerve cells.  Brain diseases are increasingly linked to changes in these complex interactions between large populations of nerve cells.

"Experimental examinations of the mechanisms that generate the responses of midbra     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) play central roles in learning and motivation. In tasks involving rewards, they respond in a stereotyped fashion. They are activated by unpredicted rewards. But when a sensory cue predicts reward, they instead start responding to the cue, while their response to reward attenuates. Moreover, when a predicted reward is omitted, their activity is transiently suppressed. From these observations, it has been postulated that dopamine neurons signal discrepancies between expected and actual reward, i.e., they compute the reward prediction error (RPE). However, it remains unknown how dopamine neurons compute RPE. To understand this question, it is important to know (1) what mechanisms suppress dopamine neurons' responses to reward when the reward is expected, and (2) what mechanisms are responsible for generating the response of dopamine neurons to reward-predicting cues. A previous study in our laboratory has shown that VTA GABA neurons exhibit sustained activations during the delay between a reward-predictive cue and reward. This result suggests that VTA GABA neurons suppress dopamine neurons' responses to reward when the reward is expected. In this proposal, to test this idea experimentally, the sustained activity of VTA GABA neurons will be optogenetically manipulated, and how this manipulation affects dopamine neurons' responses to reward will be examined electrophysiologically. Second, although previous studies have shown that the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and the ventral pallidum(VP) provide large numbers of inhibitory inputs to dopamine neurons, and NAc neurons project to VP, the exact roles of these connections in regulating the activity of dopamine neurons remain unclear. In a preliminary experiment, inactivation of unilateral NAc was found to greatly reduce dopamine neurons' responses to reward-predictive cues. We will experimentally test the hypothesis that a disynaptic, inhibitory pathway from NAc to VP to dopamine neurons is responsible in generating dopamine neurons' responses to reward-predictive cues. In total, this project aims to experimentally test the aforementioned specific hypotheses using integrative approaches in mice. Malfunctions of the dopamine system are associated with a variety of pathological conditions including depression, schizophrenia and addiction. By providing a detailed, circuit-level analysis of dopamine neuron firing, we will provide a framework for understanding how the brain learns from rewards, and how this system can be disrupted in disease.

"Engineering Microbial Opsins for Neuroscience via Structure-Guided Recombination     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Microbial opsins are light-sensitive proteins that can be expressed in specified cells via targeting promoters and turned on/off with millisecond speed, thus providing genetic and optical ('optogenetic') control of cell function with high spatial and temporal specificity. Their ability to control the electrical activity of neural circuits and confe reversible gain and loss of function of specific neuronal phenotypes allows us to study neural systems and diseases in unprecedented manner. Optogenetic research today, however, relies on a limited set of natural microbial opsins with broad activation spectra, limited ion selectivity and a narrow range of kinetics. We are proposing a novel approach to opsin engineering that capitalizes on the power of structure-guided protein engineering and directed evolution.

"A MOLECULAR CODE FOR CONNECTIVITY IN THE NEOCORTEX     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The neocortex consists of billions of neurons with trillions of connections, and is responsible for cognitive tasks such as perception and abstract reasoning. Cortical abnormalities are associated with devastating neuropsychiatric illnesses including autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia, further underscoring the importance of understanding how the cortex functions. Despite major advances in understanding the properties of individual neurons, we are just beginning to understand the rules that govern the assembly of neocortical circuits.  One major unanswered question in the field is whether molecular mechanisms direct the wiring diagram of neural circuits at the level of individual cells. In other words, is there a genetic blue print that governs the local wiring of cortical circuits? Tis question is technically challenging to address because it will require simultaneous analysis of both neuronal connectivity and the gene expression profile at the level of single cortical neurons. Moreover, it will require massive amounts of data to be collected as well as advanced analysis techniques to crack the molecular code of connectivity. We propose to use multi-whole-cell patch clamp recording combined with single-cell reverse transcription (RT)-PCR to investigate whether the clustered protocadherin gene family provides a molecular code for neural circuit assembly. The clustered protocadherins have been shown to be expressed in a combinatorial code in individual neurons, are highly expressed during synaptogenesis, and localize to synapses. Thus, clustered protocadherins are the leading candidate molecules for shaping neocortical circuits. However, their role in instructing specific synapse formation has not been directly tested due to the difficulty of these types of experiments. Furthermore, the challenging aspects of this project make it unlikely to be funded by more traditional mechanisms. The results of these experiments could revolutionize our understanding of neural circuit assembly and lead to a more principled approach to studying neuropsychiatric disorders at the circuit level.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study aims to test the hypothesis that there is a molecular code that governs the connectivity of cortical circuits.

"Mechanisms of neural circuit dynamics in working memory ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Working memory, the ability to temporarily hold multiple pieces of information for mental manipulation, is central to virtually all cognitive abiliies. Working memory has been closely associated with multiple kinds of neural activity dynamics, such as persistent neural activity, activity ramps, and activity sequences. The neural circuit mechanisms of these dynamics remain unclear. This proposal will apply advanced technologies such as virtual reality, automated monitoring of behavior, in vivo microscopy, ontogenetic, and neural circuit reconstruction to solve fundamental problems in the understanding of working memory. The accumulation of evidence over time scales of seconds, a type of working memory critical for decision-making, will be used as a test bed for studying working memory. The proposal will build upon a rodent evidence-accumulation paradigm that allows quantitative, temporally precise parameterization of working memory and decision-making. The paradigm will be implemented with head-fixed rodents behaving in a virtual reality system (Aim 1), providing mechanical stability that enables the use of two-photon calcium imaging to observe neural activity related to working memory in the neocortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum (Aim 3). Brain activity will also be perturbed using ontogenetic to probe the roles of brain regions and specific cell types in the formation and stabilization of memory (Aim 2). Finally, we will develop methods for probing the roles of cell types and connectivity in working memory through correlative serial electron microscopy and light microscopy as well as imaging of population responses to ontogenetic stimulation of single cells or groups of cells (Aim 4). This three-year project will produce a catalog of the types of neural circuit dynamics that are related to working memory across many brain regions. In subsequent years, this catalog will be mechanistically investigated by the anatomical and physiological methods developed in Aim 4. The long-term goal of this project is to arrive at a complete, brain-wide understanding of the cellular and circut mechanisms of activity dynamics related to working memory. The understanding is expected to take the form of a new generation of models containing cognitive variables distributed across brain regions, as well as models that explicitly represent neural circuit dynamics. This achievement will be a crucial step towards a mechanistic understanding of the neural basis of cognition.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Working memory, the ability to temporarily hold multiple pieces of information for mental manipulation, is central to virtually all cognitive abilities and s disrupted in diseases such as schizophrenia.

"Defining cell types, lineage, and connectivity in developing human fetal cortex ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Little is currently known about the number, proportion, or lineage of distinct cell types in the developing human fetal brain. Knowledge of such a component list and its functional genomic foundations is crucial for understanding the function of this complex system, its evolution, and how it is disrupted in disease. We hypothesize that comprehensive single-cell mRNA expression profiles provide an accurate and efficient rubric for a first generation classification schema that can be integrated with lineage, morphology and connectivity. We will use unsupervised learning algorithms to cluster 10,000 single cell transcriptomes derived from RNAseq of the human fetal cortical anlage, providing an unbiased model to identify and understand the resultant cell classes. We will validate these cell class determinations using in situ hybridization. We will use marker genes identified in this analysis to perform lineage tracing using cell-type specific reporters engineered via genome editing, and obtain single cell transcriptional profiles at different stages of development to determine lineage relationships. Finally, we will analyze intact fetal cerebral hemispheres and mouse-human chimeras processed with the CLARITY technique to provide 3D localization and morphology of a subset of cell types. To markedly improve scalability of this approach, we will apply enhanced Bessel Beam Tomography for spectral image acquisition, increasing imaging speed by 2-3 orders of magnitude while maintaining high resolution. In parallel, we will develop automated image analysis algorithms to enable cell detection and comprehensive morphological assessment in an automated and correctable fashion. Overall, completion of these studies will permit, among many future advances: (1) The generation of an unbiased rubric of cell class based on integration of morphological, transcriptomic, and connectivity data used to understand cell type diversity and function; (2) Connection of cellular function, morphology, and connectivity to specific genes and proteins; (3) Refinement of the cellular basis of transcriptomic disease signatures and understanding of the individual cellular mechanisms of disease (4) The construction of connectivity diagrams based on discovered circuit components allowing development of realistic computational models of brain function and dysfunction; (5) Optimization of cell types generated by in vitro stem cell models based on gold standard in vivo cell class definition; and (6) Advancement of light microscopy techniques for rapid, spectral high resolution imaging of postmortem human and mouse brain including automated processing, which in addition to permitting high throughput brain mapping, will significantly advance mechanistic studies in mouse models and pathological studies in human. Completion of these aims will provide a proof of principle, multiple tools, and a core framework on which to build a more comprehensive knowledge of cell classes in the human brain. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Growing evidence implicates abnormalities in the development and architecture of the human cerebral cortex in neuropsychiatric illnesses such as autism and schizophrenia.

"Neural mechanisms for reducing interference during episodic memory formation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One of the biggest challenges to successful remembering is the potential for confusion or interference between similar memories. For every password, name, or parking space that we store in memory, there are many other passwords, names or parking spaces that we have already learned or will learn in the future. While interference is a factor in relatively benign-yet annoying-examples of 'normal' forgetting, it is aso a major factor in clinically significant examples of forgetting that occur with aging and/or dementia. Thus, there is a fundamental need to understand the neural mechanisms that support the acquisition/retrieval of similar memories while minimizing interference and corresponding forgetting. Computational models of episodic memory have proposed two core mechanisms that are thought to reduce interference-related forgetting: integration and pattern separation. Integration involves 'fusing' overlapping memories into a common representation such that the relationship between these memories is more complementary than competitive. Pattern separation involves the orthogonalization of similar memories such that differences between memories are exaggerated and the potential for interference minimized. While there is general agreement that these mechanisms are theoretically appealing and offer clear computational advantages, clear evidence for how and when these learning mechanisms are invoked- particularly in humans-remains surprisingly limited? In particular, there remains ambiguity as far as (a) the learning contexts in which each mechanism might be recruited, (b) what the corresponding neural signatures of each mechanism are, and (c) the specific behavioral consequences associated with the engagement of each mechanism. We propose a systematic investigation of the contexts in which integration and pattern separation occur with the goal of using sophisticated, cutting-edge neuroimaging (fMRI) techniques to identify distributed patterns of neural activity that are diagnostic of each mechanism. Critically, we also plan to use these observed patterns of neural activity-that is, neural evidence for integration vs. separation-to predict behavioral memory phenomena, including interference-related forgetting. The research represents a strong synthesis of psychology and neuroscience questions with an emphasis on learning mechanisms inspired by computational models and analysis approaches that draw from the fields of machine learning and data mining. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A primary reason we forget is because we store a vast number of memories and interference between these memories becomes inevitable. While forgetting may represent only an occasional annoyance for most people, among older adults and those with dementia-groups that are growing at a disproportionate rate memory confusions and susceptibility to interference-related forgetting can be debilitating problems. The proposed research seeks to identify neural mechanisms that reduce interference-related forgetting and will develop neurodiagnostic tools that can be used to characterize memory processes and predict susceptibility to memory confusions and forgetting.",Neural mechanisms for reducing interference during episodic memory formation,9106892,R01NS089729,"['senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' Animals ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Mental Confusion ', ' Confusional State ', ' Confusion ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hippocampus ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Learning ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Names ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Psychology ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodent ', ' Testing ', ' base ', ' computational neuroscience ', ' Benign ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Episodic memory ', ' experience ', ' behavioral measurement ', ' behavioral measure ', ' behavior measurement ', ' forgetting ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' memory process ', ' neuroimaging ', ' Agreement ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' Address ', ' Retrieval ', ' Cognitive ', ' computational analysis ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' Behavioral ', ' neural mechanism ', ' neuromechanism ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinically significant ', ' memory encoding ', ' neural patterning ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R01,2015,285469,OR-04,0.04650537505108227

"A MOLECULAR CODE FOR CONNECTIVITY IN THE NEOCORTEX DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The neocortex consists of billions of neurons with trillions of connections, and is responsible for cognitive tasks such as perception and abstract reasoning. Cortical abnormalities are associated with devastating neuropsychiatric illnesses including autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia, further underscoring the importance of understanding how the cortex functions. Despite major advances in understanding the properties of individual neurons, we are just beginning to understand the rules that govern the assembly of neocortical circuits.  One major unanswered question in the field is whether molecular mechanisms direct the wiring diagram of neural circuits at the level of individual cells. In other words, is there a genetic blue print that governs the local wiring of cortical circuits? Tis question is technically challenging to address because it will require simultaneous analysis of both neuronal connectivity and the gene expression profile at the level of single cortical neurons. Moreover, it will require massive amounts of data to be collected as well as advanced analysis techniques to crack the molecular code of connectivity. We propose to use multi-whole-cell patch clamp recording combined with single-cell reverse transcription (RT)-PCR to investigate whether the clustered protocadherin gene family provides a molecular code for neural circuit assembly. The clustered protocadherins have been shown to be expressed in a combinatorial code in individual neurons, are highly expressed during synaptogenesis, and localize to synapses. Thus, clustered protocadherins are the leading candidate molecules for shaping neocortical circuits. However, their role in instructing specific synapse formation has not been directly tested due to the difficulty of these types of experiments. Furthermore, the challenging aspects of this project make it unlikely to be funded by more traditional mechanisms. The results of these experiments could revolutionize our understanding of neural circuit assembly and lead to a more principled approach to studying neuropsychiatric disorders at the circuit level. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study aims to test the hypothesis that there is a molecular code that governs the connectivity of cortical circuits. Abnormal connectivity in neocortical networks is thought to underlie many neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and autism spectrum disorder. Discovering the molecular code of connectivity in the cortex will provide us with the genetic blue print to study how cortical circuits are assembled and promises to also provide a paradigm shift for studying neuropsychiatric disorders at the circuit level.",A MOLECULAR CODE FOR CONNECTIVITY IN THE NEOCORTEX,8899642,R01MH103108,"['abstracting ', ' Adhesions ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Cells ', ' Cognition ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Exhibits ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Health ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Neurologic Organ System ', ' Neurologic Body System ', ' Nervous System ', ' Nervous system structure ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' Perception ', ' Printing ', ' gene product ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Reverse Transcription ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' synapse ', ' Synaptic ', ' Synapses ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' neopallium ', ' isocortex ', ' homotypical cortex ', ' Neocortex ', ' base ', ' genetic manipulation ', ' Clinical ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Genetic ', ' Shapes ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Brain Part ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Isoforms ', ' Protein Isoforms ', ' synapse formation ', ' synaptogenesis ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' neuropsychiatric ', ' neuropsychiatry ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Property ', ' patch clamp ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Binding (Molecular Function) ', ' Address ', ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Gene Family ', ' Molecular ', ' transcriptome ', ' gene expression signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' cost ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' combinatorial ', ' neocortical ', ' brain research ', ' information processing ', ' molecular marker ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA-seq ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' ']",NIMH,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2015,313000,TX-09,-0.15032167339140134
"Neuron and Glial Cellular Signatures from Normal and Diseased iPS Cells     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a critical need to define the state and predict the behavior of human brain cells in health and disease. The number of different cell types in the CNS remains undefined, and despite a demographically ordained wave of neurodegenerative diseases, not a single disease-modifying therapy exists. Our  knowledge of the CNS and the foundation for intervening rationally in disease would be dramatically  advanced by generating quantitative molecular phenotypes essentially cell signatures of human neurons,  astrocytes and oligodendrocytes from healthy people and from patients with motor neuron disease,  Huntington's disease, and Parkinson's disease. The CNS is so unique that studying non-neuronal cells does not provide much assistance. Despite this desperate need, the inaccessibility of human brain cells meant studying them would have been impossible until the recent discovery of cellular reprogramming and induced pluripotent stem cell technology.  Here we propose to form the NeuroLINCS consortium to accomplish these goals. We have handpicked the team to bring in critical expertise in iPSC technology, disease modeling, transcriptomics, epigenomics, metabolomics, whole genome sequencing, proteomics, high content, high throughput longitudinal single cell analysis, other cell-based assays, bioinformatics, statistics and computational biology. In addition, we are collaborating with Google to bring in special expertise in machine learning and the integration of signatures across platforms into highly predictive models of responses to perturbagens. Together, we expect to develop cell signatures of an array of human brain cell types under different conditions that should be broadly applicable to the LINCs community. We also anticipate generating innovative software tools and approaches that will make the signature generating process cheaper, faster, and more reliable.  Besides the unique combination of expertise represented within NeuroLINCS, another distinguishing feature is the long track record that its members have of collaborating with each other. That collaborative spirit will be expressed in NeuroLINCS through its significant and multifaceted community outreach programs. These will involve specific and detailed plans to make the data and tools that NeuroLINCS generates available to the community, to interact with other LINCS sites, and to prepare for DCIC and the prospect of disseminating knowledge and resources at scale.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The cellular signatures of human neurons we identify can be used to provide insights into the molecular factors that distinguish central neurons from healthy people from those of patients with neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS, SMA, PD and HD.

"CRCNS: Computational and neural mechanisms of memory-guided decisions DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): What aspects of previous experiences guide decisions? Much research concerns how the brain computes the average, over many experiences, of rewards received for an option. But such a summary - produced by prominent models of dopaminergic incremental learning- is chiefly useful for repetitive tasks. Much less is understood about how the brain can flexibly evaluate new or changing options in more realistic tasks, which must rely on less aggregated information. This application argues that this is fundamentally a function of memory, so this project looks to the brain's memories for the most individuated experiences - episodes - to seek new computational, cognitive and neural mechanisms that could support more flexible decisions. The overarching hypothesis is that episodic memory, supported by the hippocampus, plays a central role in guiding flexible decision making and complements the wellknown role of dopaminergic and striatal systems in incremental learning of value.     What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity? By connecting the computational neuroscience of decision making with the cognitive neuroscience of memory, and bringing together collaborators from each area, this project promises to shed light on both areas. This is because the neural mechanisms supporting episodic memory are well studied, but less so their contribution to adaptive behavior. Computationally, episodic memories can support a family of learning algorithms that draw on sparse, individual experiences, such as Monte Carlo and kernel methods. These suggest novel, plausible hypotheses for how the brain solves more realistic decision problems, and in particular how it implements ""goal-directed"" or ""model-based"" choices. The proposed studies aim to differentiate the contributions of incremental and episodic learning to value-based decisions, and test to what extent episodic memories contribute to decisions previously identified as model-based. Our hypotheses are tested fitting computational models to neural activity from functional MRI experiments in humans, and also to choice behavior in healthy individuals compared to patients with isolated damage to specific neural systems. This combination of computational, neuroimaging and neuropsychological approaches permits finely tracing the trial-by-trial dynamics of learning as reflected both in brain activity nd behavior, and also testing the causal role of particular brain regions in these same processes.     What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity? A striking range of psychiatric and neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and eating disorders, are accompanied by aberrant decision-making and by dysfunction in circuitry central to this proposal, such as striatal and fronto-temporal mechanisms. But understanding such dysfunction requires a better understanding of how each of these circuits separately influences decisions. A focus on untangling multiple decision systems is particularly pertinent to disorders such as drug abuse, which is hypothesized to center on the compromise of incremental reinforcement mechanisms that may support more habitual actions and underlie the compulsive nature of such diseases. At the same time, drugs may also weaken or compromise more deliberative or goal-directed choice systems that might otherwise be able to support more advantageous decisions. Formally understanding the roles played by both of these influences, and how they interact, promises to improve the conceptualization, diagnosis, and treatment of these and other disorders. The proposed program also provides unique opportunities for training and education. By integrating multiple core tools of systems and cognitive neuroscience (computational modeling, functional imaging, patient studies, behavioral analyses), students in the labs of both PIs are trained in different approaches to a unified research question, preparing them to be effective scientists in a more interdisciplinary future. Components of this training will also be extended to undergraduate and high school student populations through existing programs at both NYU and at Columbia and through outreach to New York area schools. This project will also help promote broader representation of minorities in science, including women. As a female neuroscientist with many women trainees in her laboratory, PI Shohamy serves as a role model and the collaborative project facilitates training for women in computational neuroscience, an area in which women are particularly underrepresented.         Protections for Human Subjects:    Acceptable        Vertebrate Animals:    Not applicable        Resource Sharing:    Acceptable. Data management plan is reasonable. Published data will be shared upon request when practically and ethically possible.        Budget and Period of Support:    Recommend as Requested Drug abuse is acquired through learning. Much research focuses on the involvement of dopaminergic  incremental learning processes. But other learning and memory systems are likely to also contribute to  aspects, such as drug-seeking, not well explained by those mechanisms.

"Experimental examinations of the mechanisms that generate the responses of midbra DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) play central roles in learning and motivation. In tasks involving rewards, they respond in a stereotyped fashion. They are activated by unpredicted rewards. But when a sensory cue predicts reward, they instead start responding to the cue, while their response to reward attenuates. Moreover, when a predicted reward is omitted, their activity is transiently suppressed. From these observations, it has been postulated that dopamine neurons signal discrepancies between expected and actual reward, i.e., they compute the reward prediction error (RPE). However, it remains unknown how dopamine neurons compute RPE. To understand this question, it is important to know (1) what mechanisms suppress dopamine neurons' responses to reward when the reward is expected, and (2) what mechanisms are responsible for generating the response of dopamine neurons to reward-predicting cues. A previous study in our laboratory has shown that VTA GABA neurons exhibit sustained activations during the delay between a reward-predictive cue and reward. This result suggests that VTA GABA neurons suppress dopamine neurons' responses to reward when the reward is expected. In this proposal, to test this idea experimentally, the sustained activity of VTA GABA neurons will be optogenetically manipulated, and how this manipulation affects dopamine neurons' responses to reward will be examined electrophysiologically. Second, although previous studies have shown that the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and the ventral pallidum(VP) provide large numbers of inhibitory inputs to dopamine neurons, and NAc neurons project to VP, the exact roles of these connections in regulating the activity of dopamine neurons remain unclear. In a preliminary experiment, inactivation of unilateral NAc was found to greatly reduce dopamine neurons' responses to reward-predictive cues. We will experimentally test the hypothesis that a disynaptic, inhibitory pathway from NAc to VP to dopamine neurons is responsible in generating dopamine neurons' responses to reward-predictive cues. In total, this project aims to experimentally test the aforementioned specific hypotheses using integrative approaches in mice. Malfunctions of the dopamine system are associated with a variety of pathological conditions including depression, schizophrenia and addiction. By providing a detailed, circuit-level analysis of dopamine neuron firing, we will provide a framework for understanding how the brain learns from rewards, and how this system can be disrupted in disease.

"CRCNS:  Neural coding and computation in large ensembles in prefrontal cortex ﻿PROJECT SUMMARY The essence of cognition is choice, and to understand choice we need to understand the brain mechanisms that guide decisions in complex settings. These mechanisms are implemented through interactions of large neural networks across cortical and subcortical areas. Tracking population response dynamics on single trials and relating them to internal cognitive states and overt behavior are critical for incisive tests of current models of decision-making. Here we propose to characterize the activity patterns of large populations of neurons (100+) in the prefrontal cortex of macaque monkeys engaged in decision-making tasks. We will explain the spatiotemporal patterns of activation in the population by developing the most parsimonious probabilistic model that takes into account pairwise and higher-order interactions of neurons. The model will be utilized to characterize response manifolds of the network and quantify its dynamics in different task epochs. Our approach is unique because rather than trying to embed the population dynamics in a low dimensional manifold using Machine Learning tools, we propose to extend the Maximum Entropy framework to directly capture the high-dimensional dynamics. Further, by characterizing functional dependencies among cells we can map the architecture and design of large networks in terms of subnetwork motifs and computations. Finally, we will investigate how noisy fluctuations of responses or artificial manipulation of network activity influences its dynamics and modifies or disturbs its computations. Scrutinizing the results of these experiments within our modeling framework makes headway toward addressing long-standing questions about decision-making, including the neural basis of psychological models and effects of initial state on the behavior.  Our work will have broader impacts in two domains. First, the path that we will chart for discovering functional subnetworks and their computations will be useable in various subfields of neuroscience. We will significantly advance data analysis and computational modeling tools available to neuroscientists and, therefore, will facilitate future studies of normal mental functions and mental disorders using high-dimensional neural data. Second, characterizing information encoding and response dynamics in the prefrontal cortex sheds light on mechanisms of decision-making and emergence of cognitive abilities in complex neural networks. Deficits of decision-making are at the heart of a number of neurological and psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's disease. Several behavioral and pharmacological therapies have been proposed for those deficits, but we lack a clear understanding of how they work at the level of neuronal systems. To develop the next generation of therapies, we need to understand how cognitive processes emerge across multiple functional levels, from individual neurons to networks of brain areas. Our work is a step in that direction. It has the potential to advance our understanding of pathology of mental disorders and help with the discovery of better treatments. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this proposal is to develop a computational framework that accurately captures response dynamics of a population of prefrontal neurons during decision-making. We will simultaneously measure and manipulate the activity of one hundred or more prefrontal neurons and develop computational models that explain the response dynamics of the prefrontal network. Our study will facilitate a better understanding of the decision-making process, which is impaired in a number of neurological and psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's disease.",CRCNS:  Neural coding and computation in large ensembles in prefrontal cortex,9052858,R01MH109180,"['Accounting ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Architecture ', ' Behavior ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Cells ', ' Cognition ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Decision Making ', ' emotional dependency ', ' Dependency ', ' Dependency (Psychology) ', ' Electrodes ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Heart ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Literature ', ' Macaque ', ' Macaca ', ' Maps ', ' Psychologic Models ', ' Psychological Models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Monkeys ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' neurophysiological ', ' neurophysiology ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Noise ', ' optical ', ' Optics ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Parkinsons disease ', "" Parkinson's disease "", "" Parkinson's "", ' Parkinson ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Lewy Body Parkinson Disease ', ' Idiopathic Parkinson Disease ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Pathology ', ' Population Dynamics ', ' Primates Mammals ', ' Primates ', ' Retina ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Testing ', ' Vocabulary Words ', ' Vocabulary ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Experimental Models ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Entropy ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' association cortex ', ' sensory cortex ', ' neural network ', ' Biological Neural Networks ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' Graph ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Reporting ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' computational framework ', ' computer framework ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' next generation ', ' Population ', ' neural mechanism ', ' neuromechanism ', ' Network-based ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' ']",NIMH,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,213460,NY-12,0.03866728215747492
"Crowd coding in the brain:3D imaging and control of collective neuronal dynamics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The cortex is a laminated structure that is thought to underlie sequential information processing. Sensory input enters layer 4 (L4) from which activity quickly spreads to superficial layers 2/3 (L2/3) and deep layers 5/6 (L5/6) and other cortical areas eventually leading to appropriate motor responses. Sensory responses themselves depend on ongoing, i.e. spontaneous cortical activity, usually in the form of reverberating activit from within or distant cortical regions, as well as the state and behavioral context of the animal. Receptive field properties of neurons can rapidly and adaptively be reshaped when an animal is engaged in a behavioral task, indicating that encoding of stimuli is dependent on task- or context-dependent state. Responses also depend on ongoing cortical dynamics in a lamina-dependent fashion and differ between the awake and anesthetized state. The intricate neuronal interplay between behavioral context, ongoing activity, and sensory stimulus underlying cortical representations is unknown.  Specifically, we do not know how neuronal circuits shape these emergent dynamics within and between laminae, and we do not know which neurons encode which aspect of a sensory stimulus. One shortcoming of all prior studies of sensory processing is that only a few neurons are sampled, and thus information about the interactions between neurons, and between neuron and global brain state is lacking.  Here we address these challenges by developing new in vivo 2-photon imaging technology that allows rapid imaging and stimulation in multiple focal planes and new computational and information theoretic techniques to extract network dynamics at the single neuron and population level. These measures go beyond paired measures and take synergistic interactions between neurons into account. We use these new techniques to investigate the 3D single cell and population activity patterns in the auditory cortex in mice. We investigate the influence of single neurons relative to the synergistic influence of specific groups of neurons (the crowd) on network dynamics and ultimately behavior of the animal. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Functioning of the normal, healthy brain, such as in sensory processing and motor actions, depends on the precise interactions of millions of nerve cells.  Brain diseases are increasingly linked to changes in these complex interactions between large populations of nerve cells.

"Mechanisms of neural circuit dynamics in working memory ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Working memory, the ability to temporarily hold multiple pieces of information for mental manipulation, is central to virtually all cognitive abiliies. Working memory has been closely associated with multiple kinds of neural activity dynamics, such as persistent neural activity, activity ramps, and activity sequences. The neural circuit mechanisms of these dynamics remain unclear. This proposal will apply advanced technologies such as virtual reality, automated monitoring of behavior, in vivo microscopy, ontogenetic, and neural circuit reconstruction to solve fundamental problems in the understanding of working memory. The accumulation of evidence over time scales of seconds, a type of working memory critical for decision-making, will be used as a test bed for studying working memory. The proposal will build upon a rodent evidence-accumulation paradigm that allows quantitative, temporally precise parameterization of working memory and decision-making. The paradigm will be implemented with head-fixed rodents behaving in a virtual reality system (Aim 1), providing mechanical stability that enables the use of two-photon calcium imaging to observe neural activity related to working memory in the neocortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum (Aim 3). Brain activity will also be perturbed using ontogenetic to probe the roles of brain regions and specific cell types in the formation and stabilization of memory (Aim 2). Finally, we will develop methods for probing the roles of cell types and connectivity in working memory through correlative serial electron microscopy and light microscopy as well as imaging of population responses to ontogenetic stimulation of single cells or groups of cells (Aim 4). This three-year project will produce a catalog of the types of neural circuit dynamics that are related to working memory across many brain regions. In subsequent years, this catalog will be mechanistically investigated by the anatomical and physiological methods developed in Aim 4. The long-term goal of this project is to arrive at a complete, brain-wide understanding of the cellular and circut mechanisms of activity dynamics related to working memory. The understanding is expected to take the form of a new generation of models containing cognitive variables distributed across brain regions, as well as models that explicitly represent neural circuit dynamics.

"Defining cell types, lineage, and connectivity in developing human fetal cortex ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Little is currently known about the number, proportion, or lineage of distinct cell types in the developing human fetal brain. Knowledge of such a component list and its functional genomic foundations is crucial for understanding the function of this complex system, its evolution, and how it is disrupted in disease. We hypothesize that comprehensive single-cell mRNA expression profiles provide an accurate and efficient rubric for a first generation classification schema that can be integrated with lineage, morphology and connectivity. We will use unsupervised learning algorithms to cluster 10,000 single cell transcriptomes derived from RNAseq of the human fetal cortical anlage, providing an unbiased model to identify and understand the resultant cell classes. We will validate these cell class determinations using in situ hybridization. We will use marker genes identified in this analysis to perform lineage tracing using cell-type specific reporters engineered via genome editing, and obtain single cell transcriptional profiles at different stages of development to determine lineage relationships. Finally, we will analyze intact fetal cerebral hemispheres and mouse-human chimeras processed with the CLARITY technique to provide 3D localization and morphology of a subset of cell types. To markedly improve scalability of this approach, we will apply enhanced Bessel Beam Tomography for spectral image acquisition, increasing imaging speed by 2-3 orders of magnitude while maintaining high resolution. In parallel, we will develop automated image analysis algorithms to enable cell detection and comprehensive morphological assessment in an automated and correctable fashion. Overall, completion of these studies will permit, among many future advances: (1) The generation of an unbiased rubric of cell class based on integration of morphological, transcriptomic, and connectivity data used to understand cell type diversity and function; (2) Connection of cellular function, morphology, and connectivity to specific genes and proteins; (3) Refinement of the cellular basis of transcriptomic disease signatures and understanding of the individual cellular mechanisms of disease (4) The construction of connectivity diagrams based on discovered circuit components allowing development of realistic computational models of brain function and dysfunction; (5) Optimization of cell types generated by in vitro stem cell models based on gold standard in vivo cell class definition; and (6) Advancement of light microscopy techniques for rapid, spectral high resolution imaging of postmortem human and mouse brain including automated processing, which in addition to permitting high throughput brain mapping, will significantly advance mechanistic studies in mouse models and pathological studies in human. Completion of these aims will provide a proof of principle, multiple tools, and a core framework on which to build a more comprehensive knowledge of cell classes in the human brain. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Growing evidence implicates abnormalities in the development and architecture of the human cerebral cortex in neuropsychiatric illnesses such as autism and schizophrenia. Understanding the pathological disruption of a complex system such as the human cortex first requires an understanding of its components: individual cells. We will develop novel methods and tools to identify the individual cell classes that compose the human fetal cortex, determine the lineage of progenitor cell classes, and map the location, morphology,

"Thalamic and Cortical Mechanisms of Itch ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Itch is a common clinical problem that is often difficult to treat. There is currently little understanding of the mechanism used in the CNS to produce itch and this likely contributes to the inability to treat itch. In recent years it have become cler that information related to itch is carried in the periphery and spinal cord by neurons that are also activated by noxious stimuli. This suggests that information necessary for the production of itch in the brain must be extracted from the responses of polysensory neurons in a process called decoding. The proposed studies, will for the first time, use single unit electrophysiologica techniques to determine the areas in the thalamus and cortex where processing of pruriceptive information occurs. The responses of single neurons in the thalamus to various itch-and pain-producing stimuli will be determined. The cortical areas to which pruriceptive thalamic neurons project will be determined using antidromic activation methods. In addition, responses of individual cortical neurons to pruritogens and pain-producing stimuli will be determined. The proposed studies will determine the thalamic nuclei and cortical areas in which processing of information related to itch and pain occur. In addition, using a Machine Learning approach, we will determine the contributions of the intensity and pattern of action potentials within responses to differential coding of itch and pain related responses. The proposed studies will considerably expand our understanding of the CNS mechanisms that produce itch and pain.        RELEVANCE: Very little is known about the neural systems in the thalamus and cerebral cortex that underlie production of the sensation of itch. This lack of understanding likely contributes to the paucity of effective treatments for the majority of types of chronic itch.

"Software for Automated Reconstruction of Structure & Dynamics of Neural Circuits ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our understanding of brain functions is hindered by the lack of detailed knowledge of synaptic connectivity in the underlying neural network. While synaptic connectivity of small neural circuits can be determined with electron microscopy, studies of connectivity on a larger scale, e.g. whole mouse brain, must be based on light microscopy imaging. It is now possible to fluorescently label subsets of neurons in vivo and image their axonal and dendritic arbors in 3D from multiple brain tissue sections. The overwhelming remaining challenge is neurite tracing, which must be done automatically due to the high-throughput nature of the problem. Currently, there are no automated tools that have the capacity to perform tracing tasks on the scale of mammalian neural circuits. Needless to say, the existence of such a tool is critical both for basic mapping of synaptic connectivity in normal brains, as well as for describing the changes in the nervous system which underlie neurological disorders. With this proposal we plan to continue the development of Neural Circuit Tracer - software for accurate, automated reconstruction of the structure and dynamics of neurites from 3D light microscopy stacks of images. Our goal is to revolutionize the existing functionalities of the software, making it possible to: (i) automatically reconstruct axonal and dendritic arbors of sparsely labeled populations of neurons from multiple stacks of images and (ii) automatically track and quantify changes in the structures of presynaptic boutons and dendritic spines imaged over time. We propose to utilize the latest machine learning and image processing techniques to develop multi-stack tracing, feature detection, and computer-guided trace editing capabilities of the software. All tools and datasets created as part of this proposal will be made available to the research community.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: At present, accurate methods of analysis of neuron morphology and synaptic connectivity rely on manual or semi-automated tracing tools.

"Engineering Microbial Opsins for Neuroscience via Structure-Guided Recombination DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Microbial opsins are light-sensitive proteins that can be expressed in specified cells via targeting promoters and turned on/off with millisecond speed, thus providing genetic and optical ('optogenetic') control of cell function with high spatial and temporal specificity. Their ability to control the electrical activity of neural circuits and confe reversible gain and loss of function of specific neuronal phenotypes allows us to study neural systems and diseases in unprecedented manner. Optogenetic research today, however, relies on a limited set of natural microbial opsins with broad activation spectra, limited ion selectivity and a narrow range of kinetics. We are proposing a novel approach to opsin engineering that capitalizes on the power of structure-guided protein engineering and directed evolution. In parallel, we will also search for novel naturally occurring opsins in niche environments.

"Crowd coding in the brain:3D imaging and control of collective neuronal dynamics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The cortex is a laminated structure that is thought to underlie sequential information processing. Sensory input enters layer 4 (L4) from which activity quickly spreads to superficial layers 2/3 (L2/3) and deep layers 5/6 (L5/6) and other cortical areas eventually leading to appropriate motor responses. Sensory responses themselves depend on ongoing, i.e. spontaneous cortical activity, usually in the form of reverberating activit from within or distant cortical regions, as well as the state and behavioral context of the animal. Receptive field properties of neurons can rapidly and adaptively be reshaped when an animal is engaged in a behavioral task, indicating that encoding of stimuli is dependent on task- or context-dependent state. Responses also depend on ongoing cortical dynamics in a lamina-dependent fashion and differ between the awake and anesthetized state. The intricate neuronal interplay between behavioral context, ongoing activity, and sensory stimulus underlying cortical representations is unknown.  Specifically, we do not know how neuronal circuits shape these emergent dynamics within and between laminae, and we do not know which neurons encode which aspect of a sensory stimulus. One shortcoming of all prior studies of sensory processing is that only a few neurons are sampled, and thus information about the interactions between neurons, and between neuron and global brain state is lacking.  Here we address these challenges by developing new in vivo 2-photon imaging technology that allows rapid imaging and stimulation in multiple focal planes and new computational and information theoretic techniques to extract network dynamics at the single neuron and population level. These measures go beyond paired measures and take synergistic interactions between neurons into account. We use these new techniques to investigate the 3D single cell and population activity patterns in the auditory cortex in mice. We investigate the influence of single neurons relative to the synergistic influence of specific groups of neurons (the crowd) on network dynamics and ultimately behavior of the animal.

"Revealing the connectivity and functionality of brain stem circuits ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neuronal circuits in the brainstem control life-sustaining functions, in addition to driving and gating active sensation through taste, smell, and touch. We propose to exploit the advent of molecular and genetic tools to undertake cell lineage marking, cell phenotyping, molecular connectomics, and methods from machine learning and image processing to construct an integrated anatomical and functional atlas of the brainstem. This will enable us to generate anatomical wiring diagrams for the brainstem circuits that control or facial actions. There are three phases to this work. (1) Reveal the identity and organization of brainstem nuclei. Motivated by striking similarities between the developmental plan for the spinal cord and brainstem, we will embrace and extend these efforts to interrogate the molecular composition of neurons that define individual nuclei with sensorimotor circuits in the murine brainstem. (2) Reveal brainstem neuronal circuits and their interactions. We will utilize Tran synaptic viral labeling to delimit pathways from specific muscles that are innervated by facial, trigeminal, hypoglossal, and laryngeal motor nuclei. This will reveal hitherto unknown brainstem circuits, including sites of modulation by higher brain areas. (3) Control the behavior of identified feedback circuits. We will manipulate specific populations of brainstem neurons using a battery of genetic tools to delineate or facial motor actions and motor synergies.  The results from the above efforts will be a quantitative map of the functional organization of neurons in the brainstem that enable studies on computations that underlie or facial behavior. An understanding of these fundamental behaviors bears directly on the more general issue of how nervous systems deal with computations that can be performed autonomously, yet must interact synergistically. Thus our proposed program on brainstem circuitry and dynamics will yield general lessons about the nature of neuronal computation. The work performed under this proposal will serve as the basis for a larger national effort in brainstem neuronal computation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Neuronal circuits in the brainstem control life-sustaining functions, including breathing and or facial behaviors such as suckling and chewing that must be performed without interruption from the moment of birth. We will use the tools of modern molecular neuroscience to add informative labels to individual neurons in the brainstem, place these cells within circuits, and connect circuits with behavioral function.

"Compressive Light Field microscopy for optogenetic neural activity tracking SUMMARY: Understanding the mechanisms by which the living brain derives perception, cognition and behavior requires the ability to record and control electrical activity in many neurons simultaneously. Completely reconstructing the pattern of neural activity that mediates a specific neural operation is critical for fully understanding its underlying mechanism. This requires an approach that can measure neural activity on a large scale with high spatial and temporal resolution. Functional imaging of genetically encoded activity sensors is one of the most promising avenues towards achieving this goal because it permits dense sampling and unambiguous separation of nearby neurons1, 2. However, even techniques currently available cannot capture neural activity in large volumes of the brain simultaneously, at high speed, and with cellular resolution. Furthermore, these existing approaches rely on expensive and sophisticated hardware, and cannot be readily adapted for imaging in unrestrained animals. Since a central goal of the BRAIN initiative is to achieve large-scale recording of neural activity in behaving animals, a new imaging approach is needed to overcome these technical challenges.  To achieve high speed, volumetric imaging in a compact and inexpensive device, we propose to develop a new imaging modality - compressive four-dimensional (4D) light field microscopy (LFM). In this approach, we will combine the advantages of light field microscopy with compressed sensing to extract the activity of thousands of individual neurons with high spatial and temporal resolution, through scattering tissue. In conventional microscopy, the photo-detector only samples the intensity of photons. In LFM, the sensor also captures the angle of the light. This allows 3D reconstruction, since position and angle enable back-tracing of rays of light. Such a scheme can be achieved simply by placing a lenslet array in the imaging pathway (Fig. 1A). The resulting 4D light field gives complete volumetric data at each time frame3-6. 3D activity can thus be sampled at camera-limited frame rates, much faster than conventional methods such as multiphoton or light sheet microscopy. For these reasons, LFM for functional brain imaging could revolutionize experimental neuroscience.  Unfortunately, imaging methods which operate in the one-photon regime suffer from light scattering. To image activity in the mammalian brain, we must consider the effects of tissue scattering through the 3D volume. We propose to apply a new approach to processing light field data for better reconstructions of neurons through scattering media37,38. Since the effect of scattering is to spread the angles of propagation of light, measuring angle information inherently helps to characterize and mitigate scatter effects. Our method leverages compressed sensing algorithms, which exploit the sparsity of the light emission in 3D space and time. Importantly, the volume and resolution limits of our method are not set by the number of pixels captured, but rather by the number of active neurons at any given time. Thus, we will be able to localize and measure the activity of thousands or millions of individually active neurons in large volumes of cerebral cortical tissue. Project Narrative This project will develop new optical imaging techniques for real-time neural activity tracking across large volumes of scattering brain tissue. The tool developed will enable new experiments in mapping and understanding how neurons work together for functional behavior in the cortex of the brain.",Compressive Light Field microscopy for optogenetic neural activity tracking,9244514,R21EY027597,"['Algorithms ', ' Animals ', ' Dorsum ', ' Back ', ' Behavior ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Cognition ', ' Communities ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Electrodes ', ' Goals ', ' Head ', ' image construction ', ' Image Reconstructions ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Microscopy ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' neurophysiological ', ' neurophysiology ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Perception ', ' Records Controls ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Work ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Photons ', ' density ', ' detector ', ' Microscope ', ' sensor ', ' brain visualization ', ' Brain imaging ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' awake ', ' Individual ', ' cerebral ', ' Cerebrum ', ' Measurement ', ' tool ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Side ', ' Sensory ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' brain tissue ', ' light emission ', ' light scattering ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' Animal Model ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Speed ', ' novel ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Devices ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' brain volume ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Physiologic Imaging ', ' Functional Imaging ', ' Scheme ', ' Process ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' cost ', ' optical imaging ', ' optic imaging ', ' 2-photon ', ' two-photon ', ' reconstruction ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' scale up ', ' Imaging technology ', ' Population ', ' Four-dimensional ', ' 4-dimensional ', ' neural patterning ', ' operation ', ' optogenetics ', ' BRAIN initiative ', ' temporal measurement ', ' time measurement ', ' temporal resolution ', ' imaging system ', ' ']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R21,2016,224725,CA-13,0.037236156603142584
"Neuron and Glial Cellular Signatures from Normal and Diseased iPS Cells     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a critical need to define the state and predict the behavior of human brain cells in health and disease. The number of different cell types in the CNS remains undefined, and despite a demographically ordained wave of neurodegenerative diseases, not a single disease-modifying therapy exists. Our  knowledge of the CNS and the foundation for intervening rationally in disease would be dramatically  advanced by generating quantitative molecular phenotypes essentially cell signatures of human neurons,  astrocytes and oligodendrocytes from healthy people and from patients with motor neuron disease,  Huntington's disease, and Parkinson's disease. The CNS is so unique that studying non-neuronal cells does not provide much assistance. Despite this desperate need, the inaccessibility of human brain cells meant studying them would have been impossible until the recent discovery of cellular reprogramming and induced pluripotent stem cell technology.  Here we propose to form the NeuroLINCS consortium to accomplish these goals. We have handpicked the team to bring in critical expertise in iPSC technology, disease modeling, transcriptomics, epigenomics, metabolomics, whole genome sequencing, proteomics, high content, high throughput longitudinal single cell analysis, other cell-based assays, bioinformatics, statistics and computational biology. In addition, we are collaborating with Google to bring in special expertise in machine learning and the integration of signatures across platforms into highly predictive models of responses to perturbagens. Together, we expect to develop cell signatures of an array of human brain cell types under different conditions that should be broadly applicable to the LINCs community. We also anticipate generating innovative software tools and approaches that will make the signature generating process cheaper, faster, and more reliable.  Besides the unique combination of expertise represented within NeuroLINCS, another distinguishing feature is the long track record that its members have of collaborating with each other. That collaborative spirit will be expressed in NeuroLINCS through its significant and multifaceted community outreach programs. These will involve specific and detailed plans to make the data and tools that NeuroLINCS generates available to the community, to interact with other LINCS sites, and to prepare for DCIC and the prospect of disseminating knowledge and resources at scale.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The cellular signatures of human neurons we identify can be used to provide insights into the molecular factors that distinguish central neurons from healthy people from those of patients with neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS, SMA, PD and HD.

"Mechanisms of neural circuit dynamics in working memory ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Working memory, the ability to temporarily hold multiple pieces of information for mental manipulation, is central to virtually all cognitive abiliies. Working memory has been closely associated with multiple kinds of neural activity dynamics, such as persistent neural activity, activity ramps, and activity sequences. The neural circuit mechanisms of these dynamics remain unclear. This proposal will apply advanced technologies such as virtual reality, automated monitoring of behavior, in vivo microscopy, ontogenetic, and neural circuit reconstruction to solve fundamental problems in the understanding of working memory. The accumulation of evidence over time scales of seconds, a type of working memory critical for decision-making, will be used as a test bed for studying working memory. The proposal will build upon a rodent evidence-accumulation paradigm that allows quantitative, temporally precise parameterization of working memory and decision-making. The paradigm will be implemented with head-fixed rodents behaving in a virtual reality system (Aim 1), providing mechanical stability that enables the use of two-photon calcium imaging to observe neural activity related to working memory in the neocortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum (Aim 3). Brain activity will also be perturbed using ontogenetic to probe the roles of brain regions and specific cell types in the formation and stabilization of memory (Aim 2). Finally, we will develop methods for probing the roles of cell types and connectivity in working memory through correlative serial electron microscopy and light microscopy as well as imaging of population responses to ontogenetic stimulation of single cells or groups of cells (Aim 4). This three-year project will produce a catalog of the types of neural circuit dynamics that are related to working memory across many brain regions. In subsequent years, this catalog will be mechanistically investigated by the anatomical and physiological methods developed in Aim 4. The long-term goal of this project is to arrive at a complete, brain-wide understanding of the cellular and circut mechanisms of activity dynamics related to working memory. The understanding is expected to take the form of a new generation of models containing cognitive variables distributed across brain regions, as well as models that explicitly represent neural circuit dynamics. This achievement will be a crucial step towards a mechanistic understanding of the neural basis of cognition.

The long-term goals of this project are to characterize neural activity dynamics related to working memory in diverse brain regions, and to account for those dynamics in an integrated, brain-wide fashion in terms of cellular and circuit mechanisms.

"Crowd coding in the brain:3D imaging and control of collective neuronal dynamics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The cortex is a laminated structure that is thought to underlie sequential information processing. Sensory input enters layer 4 (L4) from which activity quickly spreads to superficial layers 2/3 (L2/3) and deep layers 5/6 (L5/6) and other cortical areas eventually leading to appropriate motor responses. Sensory responses themselves depend on ongoing, i.e. spontaneous cortical activity, usually in the form of reverberating activit from within or distant cortical regions, as well as the state and behavioral context of the animal. Receptive field properties of neurons can rapidly and adaptively be reshaped when an animal is engaged in a behavioral task, indicating that encoding of stimuli is dependent on task- or context-dependent state. Responses also depend on ongoing cortical dynamics in a lamina-dependent fashion and differ between the awake and anesthetized state. The intricate neuronal interplay between behavioral context, ongoing activity, and sensory stimulus underlying cortical representations is unknown.  Specifically, we do not know how neuronal circuits shape these emergent dynamics within and between laminae, and we do not know which neurons encode which aspect of a sensory stimulus. One shortcoming of all prior studies of sensory processing is that only a few neurons are sampled, and thus information about the interactions between neurons, and between neuron and global brain state is lacking.  Here we address these challenges by developing new in vivo 2-photon imaging technology that allows rapid imaging and stimulation in multiple focal planes and new computational and information theoretic techniques to extract network dynamics at the single neuron and population level. These measures go beyond paired measures and take synergistic interactions between neurons into account. We use these new techniques to investigate the 3D single cell and population activity patterns in the auditory cortex in mice. We investigate the influence of single neurons relative to the synergistic influence of specific groups of neurons (the crowd) on network dynamics and ultimately behavior of the animal. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Functioning of the normal, healthy brain, such as in sensory processing and motor actions, depends on the precise interactions of millions of nerve cells.  Brain diseases are increasingly linked to changes in these complex interactions between large populations of nerve cells.   The current project develops novel imaging tools and analysis concepts to simultaneously study large groups of nerve cells in the awake brain with high temporal and cellular resolution, and will lay the groundwork for deeper insights into how the brain processes information and may provide mechanistic insights into brain disorders such as cerebral palsy, epilepsy, autism, and schizophrenia.",Crowd coding in the brain:3D imaging and control of collective neuronal dynamics,9118355,U01NS090569,"['Accounting ', ' Action Potentials ', ' Algorithms ', ' Animals ', ' Auditory Cortex ', ' Auditory area ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' Infantile Autism ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Animal Behavior ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Cerebral cortex ', ' Cerebral Palsy ', ' Communication ', ' Crowding ', ' Decision Making ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Engineering ', ' epileptogenic ', ' epileptiform ', ' epilepsia ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' Epileptics ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Language ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Maps ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' Pathology ', ' Population Dynamics ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' density ', ' Microscope ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Area ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' awake ', ' receptive field ', ' auditory discrimination ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Msec ', ' millisecond ', ' Complex ', ' Scanning ', ' Distant ', ' Sensory ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' Outcome Study ', ' neuronal circuit ', ' neuronal circuitry ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' physicochemical phenomena related to the senses ', ' perceptual stimulus ', ' sensory stimulus ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' Three Dimensional Medical Imaging ', ' 3D imaging ', ' 3-D Imaging ', ' Three-Dimensional Imaging ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Sensory Process ', ' Address ', ' Imaging Tool ', ' Imaging Instrument ', ' Imaging Device ', ' Motor ', ' Population-Level Process ', ' Population Process ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Use of New Techniques ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' 2-photon ', ' two-photon ', ' Imaging technology ', ' Population ', ' analytical tool ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' information processing ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' temporal measurement ', ' time measurement ', ' temporal resolution ', ' sensory input ', ' graph theory ', ' ']",NINDS,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",U01,2016,479434,MD-05,0.07186723858534903
"Neuron and Glial Cellular Signatures from Normal and Diseased iPS Cells DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a critical need to define the state and predict the behavior of human brain cells in health and disease. The number of different cell types in the CNS remains undefined, and despite a demographically ordained wave of neurodegenerative diseases, not a single disease-modifying therapy exists. Our  knowledge of the CNS and the foundation for intervening rationally in disease would be dramatically  advanced by generating quantitative molecular phenotypes essentially cell signatures of human neurons,  astrocytes and oligodendrocytes from healthy people and from patients with motor neuron disease,  Huntington's disease, and Parkinson's disease. The CNS is so unique that studying non-neuronal cells does not provide much assistance. Despite this desperate need, the inaccessibility of human brain cells meant studying them would have been impossible until the recent discovery of cellular reprogramming and induced pluripotent stem cell technology.  Here we propose to form the NeuroLINCS consortium to accomplish these goals. We have handpicked the team to bring in critical expertise in iPSC technology, disease modeling, transcriptomics, epigenomics, metabolomics, whole genome sequencing, proteomics, high content, high throughput longitudinal single cell analysis, other cell-based assays, bioinformatics, statistics and computational biology. In addition, we are collaborating with Google to bring in special expertise in machine learning and the integration of signatures across platforms into highly predictive models of responses to perturbagens. Together, we expect to develop cell signatures of an array of human brain cell types under different conditions that should be broadly applicable to the LINCs community. We also anticipate generating innovative software tools and approaches that will make the signature generating process cheaper, faster, and more reliable.  Besides the unique combination of expertise represented within NeuroLINCS, another distinguishing feature is the long track record that its members have of collaborating with each other. That collaborative spirit will be expressed in NeuroLINCS through its significant and multifaceted community outreach programs. These will involve specific and detailed plans to make the data and tools that NeuroLINCS generates available to the community, to interact with other LINCS sites, and to prepare for DCIC and the prospect of disseminating knowledge and resources at scale. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The cellular signatures of human neurons we identify can be used to provide insights into the molecular factors that distinguish central neurons from healthy people from those of patients with neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS, SMA, PD and HD.

"CRCNS: Computational and neural mechanisms of memory-guided decisions DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): What aspects of previous experiences guide decisions? Much research concerns how the brain computes the average, over many experiences, of rewards received for an option. But such a summary - produced by prominent models of dopaminergic incremental learning- is chiefly useful for repetitive tasks. Much less is understood about how the brain can flexibly evaluate new or changing options in more realistic tasks, which must rely on less aggregated information. This application argues that this is fundamentally a function of memory, so this project looks to the brain's memories for the most individuated experiences - episodes - to seek new computational, cognitive and neural mechanisms that could support more flexible decisions. The overarching hypothesis is that episodic memory, supported by the hippocampus, plays a central role in guiding flexible decision making and complements the wellknown role of dopaminergic and striatal systems in incremental learning of value.     What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity? By connecting the computational neuroscience of decision making with the cognitive neuroscience of memory, and bringing together collaborators from each area, this project promises to shed light on both areas. This is because the neural mechanisms supporting episodic memory are well studied, but less so their contribution to adaptive behavior. Computationally, episodic memories can support a family of learning algorithms that draw on sparse, individual experiences, such as Monte Carlo and kernel methods. These suggest novel, plausible hypotheses for how the brain solves more realistic decision problems, and in particular how it implements ""goal-directed"" or ""model-based"" choices. The proposed studies aim to differentiate the contributions of incremental and episodic learning to value-based decisions, and test to what extent episodic memories contribute to decisions previously identified as model-based. Our hypotheses are tested fitting computational models to neural activity from functional MRI experiments in humans, and also to choice behavior in healthy individuals compared to patients with isolated damage to specific neural systems. This combination of computational, neuroimaging and neuropsychological approaches permits finely tracing the trial-by-trial dynamics of learning as reflected both in brain activity nd behavior, and also testing the causal role of particular brain regions in these same processes.     What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity? A striking range of psychiatric and neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and eating disorders, are accompanied by aberrant decision-making and by dysfunction in circuitry central to this proposal, such as striatal and fronto-temporal mechanisms. But understanding such dysfunction requires a better understanding of how each of these circuits separately influences decisions. A focus on untangling multiple decision systems is particularly pertinent to disorders such as drug abuse, which is hypothesized to center on the compromise of incremental reinforcement mechanisms that may support more habitual actions and underlie the compulsive nature of such diseases. At the same time, drugs may also weaken or compromise more deliberative or goal-directed choice systems that might otherwise be able to support more advantageous decisions. Formally understanding the roles played by both of these influences, and how they interact, promises to improve the conceptualization, diagnosis, and treatment of these and other disorders. The proposed program also provides unique opportunities for training and education. By integrating multiple core tools of systems and cognitive neuroscience (computational modeling, functional imaging, patient studies, behavioral analyses), students in the labs of both PIs are trained in different approaches to a unified research question, preparing them to be effective scientists in a more interdisciplinary future. Components of this training will also be extended to undergraduate and high school student populations through existing programs at both NYU and at Columbia and through outreach to New York area schools. This project will also help promote broader representation of minorities in science, including women. As a female neuroscientist with many women trainees in her laboratory, PI Shohamy serves as a role model and the collaborative project facilitates training for women in computational neuroscience, an area in which women are particularly underrepresented.         Protections for Human Subjects:    Acceptable        Vertebrate Animals:    Not applicable        Resource Sharing:    Acceptable. Data management plan is reasonable. Published data will be shared upon request when practically and ethically possible.        Budget and Period of Support:    Recommend as Requested Drug abuse is acquired through learning. Much research focuses on the involvement of dopaminergic  incremental learning processes. But other learning and memory systems are likely to also contribute to  aspects, such as drug-seeking, not well explained by those mechanisms. By isolating the contribution of  different memory systems to learned choice, this project may help to guide future treatment strategies.",CRCNS: Computational and neural mechanisms of memory-guided decisions,9098673,R01DA038891,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Behavior ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Budgets ', ' Choice Behavior ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' striatal ', ' Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' Cues ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' abuses drugs ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' Drug abuse ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Eating Disorders ', ' Family ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hippocampus ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Memory ', ' Midbrain ', ' Mid-brain ', ' Mesencephalon ', ' Midbrain structure ', ' Monte Carlo simulation ', ' Monte Carlo procedure ', ' Monte Carlo calculation ', ' Monte Carlo algorithm ', ' Monte Carlo Method ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' neuropsychologic ', ' Neuropsychologies ', ' Neuropsychology ', ' New York ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Parkinsons disease ', "" Parkinson's disease "", "" Parkinson's "", ' Parkinson ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Publishing ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Research ', ' Rewards ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schools ', ' Science ', ' Specificity ', ' statistics ', ' Strikes ', ' Employee Strikes ', ' Students ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vertebrates ', ' vertebrata ', ' Vertebrate Animals ', ' Woman ', ' Adaptive Behaviors ', ' adaptive behavior ', ' adaptation behavior ', ' Dissociation ', ' base ', ' computational neuroscience ', ' role model ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' System ', ' Training and Education ', ' Episodic memory ', ' data management ', ' experience ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' behavioral test ', ' behavior test ', ' outreach ', ' sorting ', ' Sorting - Cell Movement ', ' human subject protection ', ' Modeling ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' Cognitive ', ' Physiologic Imaging ', ' Functional Imaging ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' cognitive neuroscience ', ' neuropsychological ', ' dopamine system ', ' treatment strategy ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' High School Student ', ' Secondary Student ', ' Secondary School Student ', ' behavioral study ', ' behavior study ', ' neural correlate ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' ']",NIDA,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,326999,NJ-12,0.0429242970861148
"Revealing the connectivity and functionality of brain stem circuits ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neuronal circuits in the brainstem control life-sustaining functions, in addition to driving and gating active sensation through taste, smell, and touch. We propose to exploit the advent of molecular and genetic tools to undertake cell lineage marking, cell phenotyping, molecular connectomics, and methods from machine learning and image processing to construct an integrated anatomical and functional atlas of the brainstem. This will enable us to generate anatomical wiring diagrams for the brainstem circuits that control or facial actions. There are three phases to this work. (1) Reveal the identity and organization of brainstem nuclei. Motivated by striking similarities between the developmental plan for the spinal cord and brainstem, we will embrace and extend these efforts to interrogate the molecular composition of neurons that define individual nuclei with sensorimotor circuits in the murine brainstem. (2) Reveal brainstem neuronal circuits and their interactions. We will utilize Tran synaptic viral labeling to delimit pathways from specific muscles that are innervated by facial, trigeminal, hypoglossal, and laryngeal motor nuclei. This will reveal hitherto unknown brainstem circuits, including sites of modulation by higher brain areas. (3) Control the behavior of identified feedback circuits. We will manipulate specific populations of brainstem neurons using a battery of genetic tools to delineate or facial motor actions and motor synergies.  The results from the above efforts will be a quantitative map of the functional organization of neurons in the brainstem that enable studies on computations that underlie or facial behavior. An understanding of these fundamental behaviors bears directly on the more general issue of how nervous systems deal with computations that can be performed autonomously, yet must interact synergistically. Thus our proposed program on brainstem circuitry and dynamics will yield general lessons about the nature of neuronal computation. The work performed under this proposal will serve as the basis for a larger national effort in brainstem neuronal computation.

"Filtered Point Process Inference Framework for Modeling Neural Data ABSTRACT  Neuronal spike-trains and various other signals in the central nervous system have a discrete, impulsive nature that is well characterized with point process statistical models. In several neuroscience applications, such impulsive signals are transformed upon interaction with biological processes or measurement artifacts, and are consequently observed as filtered point process data. The goal of this project is to develop a principled statistical signal processing framework for filtered point processes with models and algorithms for estimation and inference, and to apply these novel methodologies to experimental data from rodent brain calcium imaging data and human neuroendocrine data. Our approach centers on a unified framework for sparse representation and dynamical systems modeling of marked point process data arising in neuroscience analyses. In addition to its novel statistical methodology, another major strength of our proposal is the application of these methods to experimental data arising in fundamental neuroscience and clinical problems, both to validate the new methods with real data and to investigate basic science questions related to the central nervous system structural and functional organization. Large-scale two-photon calcium imaging, in conjunction with spike-train deconvolution, will allow us to study the activity of over a thousand identified neurons simultaneously with single-spike resolution in a behaving animal. This will allow us to elucidate with high accuracy how the magnitude and spatial structure of signal and noise correlations across neurons vary with stimuli or behavioral tasks. It will shed light on visual encoding in the rodent brain, and neuronal architectures underlying visual perception and cognition, at an unprecedented spatiotemporal scale. Further, our modeling of pulsatile hormone secretion will apply to the release of cortisol, gonadal steroids, insulin, thyroid and growth hormones. Diseases linked to abnormal cortisol secretion include diabetes, visceral obesity and osteoporosis, disturbed memory formation and life-threatening Addisonian crisis. Hence, understanding and modeling the underlying impulsive nature of normal hormone release will aid our understanding of pathological neuroendocrine states and improve the efficacy of drugs and other interventions for treatment of hormonal disorders. Additionally, this project will combine Brown Lab’s computational expertise in point process models with Sur Lab’s experimental expertise in neuronal calcium imaging, extending our ongoing collaboration under the NIH Brain Initiative to developing novel neural population analysis techniques with unprecedented detail at single-neuron, single-spike resolution. Our research is well poised to improve significantly the state of the art and in computational and systems neuroscience tools and bridge together components from the statistical learning, signal processing and computational neuroscience communities to produce a unifying analytical framework for neural data analysis. NARRATIVE  In this project we will develop a filtered point process framework for neural data analysis, with models and algorithms for sparse recovery of spike-trains from time-series data comprising a series of pulsed waveforms. We will use this novel methodology to extract neuronal spike-trains from calcium imaging data of cortical tissue, and to estimate hormone secretion times and amounts from serum hormone levels. We will make our mathematical algorithms for neural data analysis and their software implementation freely and easily available to the neuroscience research community.",Filtered Point Process

"The role of neuroepigenetics in bidirectional behavioral states Abstract  In the last decade it has become increasingly apparent that epigenetic mechanisms regulating gene expression play an important role in brain function and dysfunction. Disruption in neuroepigenetic developmental processes such as DNA methylation and histone acetylation result in mental retardation and cognitive impairments. More recently, neuroepigenetic processes have also been implicated in adult behaviors, such as addiction and memory. This opens the possibility that these mechanisms may be able to control the establishment and maintenance of behavioral states. However, the underlying mechanisms through which neuroepigenetic processes can mediate changes in circuit excitability to determine behavioral states remain mysterious. Moreover, because of the complexity and heterogeneity of the mammalian brain, we have no knowledge about the genetic loci of integration between the environment and behavior, and the identity of the neural pathways that control them in specific circuits. This presents a major roadblock towards unlocking the interface between brain and environment and their role in human health and disease. Here we propose a three-prong solution to this problem by using: a brain that shows conserved neurochemistry and neuroepigenetic mechanisms, but with orders of magnitude fewer neurons and homogenous circuits compared to mammalian brains, behaviors that are regulated by the environment (hunger and satiety), and an environment that is experimentally controllable (fasting vs. re-feeding; normal diet vs. high sugar diet). Changes in the excitability and plasticity of conserved circuits determine outputs feeding states like hunger and satiety. These changes occur slow, are persistent over hours, depend on the physiological state and are bidirectional. Thus, they could be encoded neuroepigenetically to alter the expression of key genes important to modulate circuit excitability. Furthermore, because a large number of metabolism intermediates functions as cofactors for chromatin modifying enzymes, physiological changes in metabolites and nutrients can directly alter gene expression. My lab has pioneered techniques and established unique collaborations to address the functional role of neuroepigenetic processes in regulating the activity of specific circuits in the context of feeding states. We propose to map how environmental inputs act on chromatin and gene expression to direct the changes in neuronal excitability that underlie output feeding behaviors. First, we will identify the specific chromatin pathways that act in a unique circuit important to switch the behavioral state of the fly between hungry and sated. We will then map the functional genetic loci of integration between physiological state and output behavioral states by examining the occupancy of these pathways on chromatin and their effect on behavior and neural activity. We will then dissect how changes in environmental input (energy scarcity in fasting, energy availability in re-feeding, and energy surplus in a high sugar diet) directly affect gene expression by altering the activity of these pathways and their genetic loci of integration. To this end, we will work with analytical chemists to develop new methods to measure changes in metabolites in the blood, brain and specific circuits and with computational biologists to harness machine learning analysis to integrate metabolism and gene expression datasets to identify the molecular pathways that act at the interface between input and effector mechanisms to regulate output behavioral states. Because the endocrine and physiological changes that underlie hunger and satiety are evolutionary conserved, our approach will provide a model of how the environment can functionally determine bidirectional, flip-flop behavioral states through neuroepigenetic mechanisms. More broadly, these studies will uncover how epigenetic mechanisms may function as gatekeepers of “behavioral states” (normal and abnormal), to provide the molecular and physiological mechanisms underlying the “conditioning” effect of environments (from nutrients to maternal care) on neural plasticity. Public Health Relevance Statement: The proposed study will identify how nutrients in diet play a key role in regulating hunger and satiety states by changing neuronal activity and behavior. This will pave the way to understanding how the increased consumption of calories is linked to diseases such as depression, cancer, aging and neurodegeneration. More broadly, these experiments will identify in detail the molecular and physiological adaptations of a cellular system to a changing environment, develop new methodologies to study metabolism, and computational tool to integrate large orthogonal gene expression and metabolism datasets.",The role of neuroepigenetics in bidirectional behavioral states,9167992,DP2DK113750,"['abstracting ', ' Physiologic Adaptations ', ' Physiological Adaptation ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Aging ', ' Behavior ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Chromatin ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Enzymes ', ' fasts ', ' fasted ', ' Fasting ', ' nutrient intake activity ', ' feeding-related behaviors ', ' Ingestive Behavior ', ' Feeding behaviors ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Hunger ', ' Maintenance ', ' Maps ', ' Memory ', ' Mental Retardation ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolism ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' Neural Pathways ', ' neurochemical ', ' neurochemistry ', ' neuroplasticity ', ' neuroplastic ', ' neural plasticity ', ' CNS plasticity ', ' Neuronal Plasticity ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' Play ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' satiety ', ' Satiation ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' cofactor ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' sugar ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Metabolism Studies ', ' Metabolic Studies ', ' Abnormal Assessment of Metabolism ', ' metabolic abnormality assessment ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Knowledge ', ' Hour ', ' Calories ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Endocrine ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Nutrient ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' gatekeeper ', ' Gatekeeping ', ' Modeling ', ' Histone Acetylation ', ' Address ', ' Developmental Process ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Flies ', ' fly ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Output ', ' feeding ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' neuronal excitability ', ' conditioning ', ' Consumption ', ' brain behavior ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,DP2,2016,2009885,MI-12,-0.11864545186293787
"CRCNS: Network mechanisms of the learning and encoding of timed motor responses The brain is an inherently dynamic system, it evolved under strong selective pressures to allow animals to interact with the environment in real-time, and predict and prepare for future events. For these reasons, understanding neural dynamics, and how the brain tells and encodes time is fundamental to understanding brain function. The importance of neural dynamics and timing to brain function emphasizes the need for techniques that allow for the collection and analysis of massively parallel single neuron recordings across multiple structures in behaving animals. This project will combine novel electrophysiological, behavioral, analytical and computational methods to reverse engineer the neural circuits underlying learning and timing. The first aim is to combine large-scale neural recordings with computational approaches to determine how time is represented in the striatum and prefrontal cortex, two interacting brain areas that are closely implicated in temporal processing. We will specifically examine whether encoding of time relies on absolute, relative, or stimulus-specific coding mechanisms. Recordings will be carried out in awake, head-fixed mice trained on a classical trace reward conditioning task in which two cues predict reward with a different delay period. When animals learn the cue-reward association, they engage in robust anticipatory licking that precedes the reward presentation; moreover, the timing of this behavior is dependent on the cue-reward delay time. The second aim is to combine electrophysiology and optogenetics to determine if temporal coding in the striatum and prefrontal cortex is perturbed by transiently disrupting network activity. The hypothesis is that if dynamics of the timing circuits are perturbed then the ensuing activity patterns will be irreversibly altered, thus reducing the accuracy or precision of timed behavioral responses. The third aim is to develop a novel computational framework based on recurrent neural networks models that can predict ""future"" patterns of neural ensemble activity based on ""present"" patterns. The ultimate goal of this work is to integrate highly innovative electrophysiological and computational methods for reverse engineering brain circuit function at the level of networks of hundreds of neurons in the striatum and prefrontal cortex. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Learning to produce appropriately timed actions is fundamental to many aspects of behavior, and disruption of the brain circuits underlying this process is implicated in many neurological and psychiatric disorders. This project will develop an integrated approach to studying the mechanisms of timed motor behavior by combining large-scale neural recordings from multiple brain areas and computational modeling of neural networks.

"CRCNS: Sensory-Motor Integration in Mammalian Brian: experiment, analysis, modeling A major goal facing organisms acting in the natural world is the selection of appropriate actions based on sensory information and prior knowledge accumulated through previous experience. Understanding how neural networks process information and control such actions requires a breakthrough both in large scale chronic data collection methods during behavioral tasks and in the development of new analysis and modeling tools that will be able to capture the dynamics and organization of such neural networks. To address key questions in the context of sensory-motor control and learning we propose a multidisciplinary approach that will synergize the expertise of the four groups involved in cellular and systems neuroscience, machine learning, signal processing, control theory and modeling. Our goal is to establish an empirically-grounded systems-level model explaining the interaction and integration within the sensory-motor system during behavioral tasks, which is consistent with the experimental data, and which provides concrete predictions for future experiments. More specifically, we intend to further our understanding on two main fronts. First, study cell type specific components that participate in the movement command and in sensory-motor error prediction. We hypothesize that layer 2-3 neurons subserve different roles from layer 5 neurons, and may be more strongly involved in error estimation rather than in control. Second, we intend to investigate whether and how the sensory and motor ends change in order to adapt to the new learned task. Here again we expect differences between the different cortical layers. Such a framework will not only provide new insights into the specific investigated system, but could be transferrable more generally to probe the structure and functionality of complex biological networks. In addition, the unique analysis methods developed and the deep understanding of biological sensory-motor systems may contribute invaluably to fields such as robotics and network control, and to the development of new prosthetics approaches within the field of Brain Computer Interfaces. RELEVANCE (See instructions): The goals of this research proposal are expected to provide novel insight on sensory-motor control as well as structural and functional plasticity processes of the cortical network during sensory-motor learning.

"A MOLECULAR CODE FOR CONNECTIVITY IN THE NEOCORTEX DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The neocortex consists of billions of neurons with trillions of connections, and is responsible for cognitive tasks such as perception and abstract reasoning. Cortical abnormalities are associated with devastating neuropsychiatric illnesses including autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia, further underscoring the importance of understanding how the cortex functions. Despite major advances in understanding the properties of individual neurons, we are just beginning to understand the rules that govern the assembly of neocortical circuits.  One major unanswered question in the field is whether molecular mechanisms direct the wiring diagram of neural circuits at the level of individual cells. In other words, is there a genetic blue print that governs the local wiring of cortical circuits? Tis question is technically challenging to address because it will require simultaneous analysis of both neuronal connectivity and the gene expression profile at the level of single cortical neurons. Moreover, it will require massive amounts of data to be collected as well as advanced analysis techniques to crack the molecular code of connectivity. We propose to use multi-whole-cell patch clamp recording combined with single-cell reverse transcription (RT)-PCR to investigate whether the clustered protocadherin gene family provides a molecular code for neural circuit assembly. The clustered protocadherins have been shown to be expressed in a combinatorial code in individual neurons, are highly expressed during synaptogenesis, and localize to synapses. Thus, clustered protocadherins are the leading candidate molecules for shaping neocortical circuits. However, their role in instructing specific synapse formation has not been directly tested due to the difficulty of these types of experiments. Furthermore, the challenging aspects of this project make it unlikely to be funded by more traditional mechanisms. The results of these experiments could revolutionize our understanding of neural circuit assembly and lead to a more principled approach to studying neuropsychiatric disorders at the circuit level. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study aims to test the hypothesis that there is a molecular code that governs the connectivity of cortical circuits. Abnormal connectivity in neocortical networks is thought to underlie many neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and autism spectrum disorder.

"Thalamic and Cortical Mechanisms of Itch ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Itch is a common clinical problem that is often difficult to treat. There is currently little understanding of the mechanism used in the CNS to produce itch and this likely contributes to the inability to treat itch. In recent years it have become cler that information related to itch is carried in the periphery and spinal cord by neurons that are also activated by noxious stimuli. This suggests that information necessary for the production of itch in the brain must be extracted from the responses of polysensory neurons in a process called decoding. The proposed studies, will for the first time, use single unit electrophysiologica techniques to determine the areas in the thalamus and cortex where processing of pruriceptive information occurs. The responses of single neurons in the thalamus to various itch-and pain-producing stimuli will be determined. The cortical areas to which pruriceptive thalamic neurons project will be determined using antidromic activation methods. In addition, responses of individual cortical neurons to pruritogens and pain-producing stimuli will be determined. The proposed studies will determine the thalamic nuclei and cortical areas in which processing of information related to itch and pain occur. In addition, using a Machine Learning approach, we will determine the contributions of the intensity and pattern of action potentials within responses to differential coding of itch and pain related responses. The proposed studies will considerably expand our understanding of the CNS mechanisms that produce itch and pain.        RELEVANCE: Very little is known about the neural systems in the thalamus and cerebral cortex that underlie production of the sensation of itch. This lack of understanding likely contributes to the paucity of effective treatments for the majority of types of chronic itch.

"Neural mechanisms for reducing interference during episodic memory formation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One of the biggest challenges to successful remembering is the potential for confusion or interference between similar memories. For every password, name, or parking space that we store in memory, there are many other passwords, names or parking spaces that we have already learned or will learn in the future. While interference is a factor in relatively benign-yet annoying-examples of 'normal' forgetting, it is aso a major factor in clinically significant examples of forgetting that occur with aging and/or dementia. Thus, there is a fundamental need to understand the neural mechanisms that support the acquisition/retrieval of similar memories while minimizing interference and corresponding forgetting. Computational models of episodic memory have proposed two core mechanisms that are thought to reduce interference-related forgetting: integration and pattern separation. Integration involves 'fusing' overlapping memories into a common representation such that the relationship between these memories is more complementary than competitive. Pattern separation involves the orthogonalization of similar memories such that differences between memories are exaggerated and the potential for interference minimized. While there is general agreement that these mechanisms are theoretically appealing and offer clear computational advantages, clear evidence for how and when these learning mechanisms are invoked- particularly in humans-remains surprisingly limited? In particular, there remains ambiguity as far as (a) the learning contexts in which each mechanism might be recruited, (b) what the corresponding neural signatures of each mechanism are, and (c) the specific behavioral consequences associated with the engagement of each mechanism. We propose a systematic investigation of the contexts in which integration and pattern separation occur with the goal of using sophisticated, cutting-edge neuroimaging (fMRI) techniques to identify distributed patterns of neural activity that are diagnostic of each mechanism. Critically, we also plan to use these observed patterns of neural activity-that is, neural evidence for integration vs. separation-to predict behavioral memory phenomena, including interference-related forgetting. The research represents a strong synthesis of psychology and neuroscience questions with an emphasis on learning mechanisms inspired by computational models and analysis approaches that draw from the fields of machine learning and data mining.

"Software for Automated Reconstruction of Structure & Dynamics of Neural Circuits ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our understanding of brain functions is hindered by the lack of detailed knowledge of synaptic connectivity in the underlying neural network. While synaptic connectivity of small neural circuits can be determined with electron microscopy, studies of connectivity on a larger scale, e.g. whole mouse brain, must be based on light microscopy imaging. It is now possible to fluorescently label subsets of neurons in vivo and image their axonal and dendritic arbors in 3D from multiple brain tissue sections. The overwhelming remaining challenge is neurite tracing, which must be done automatically due to the high-throughput nature of the problem. Currently, there are no automated tools that have the capacity to perform tracing tasks on the scale of mammalian neural circuits. Needless to say, the existence of such a tool is critical both for basic mapping of synaptic connectivity in normal brains, as well as for describing the changes in the nervous system which underlie neurological disorders. With this proposal we plan to continue the development of Neural Circuit Tracer - software for accurate, automated reconstruction of the structure and dynamics of neurites from 3D light microscopy stacks of images. Our goal is to revolutionize the existing functionalities of the software, making it possible to: (i) automatically reconstruct axonal and dendritic arbors of sparsely labeled populations of neurons from multiple stacks of images and (ii) automatically track and quantify changes in the structures of presynaptic boutons and dendritic spines imaged over time. We propose to utilize the latest machine learning and image processing techniques to develop multi-stack tracing, feature detection, and computer-guided trace editing capabilities of the software. All tools and datasets created as part of this proposal will be made available to the research community. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: At present, accurate methods of analysis of neuron morphology and synaptic connectivity rely on manual or semi-automated tracing tools. Such methods are time consuming, can be prone to errors, and do not scale up to the level of large brain-mapping projects.

"Neuron and Glial Cellular Signatures from Normal and Diseased iPS Cells DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a critical need to define the state and predict the behavior of human brain cells in health and disease. The number of different cell types in the CNS remains undefined, and despite a demographically ordained wave of neurodegenerative diseases, not a single disease-modifying therapy exists. Our  knowledge of the CNS and the foundation for intervening rationally in disease would be dramatically  advanced by generating quantitative molecular phenotypes essentially cell signatures of human neurons,  astrocytes and oligodendrocytes from healthy people and from patients with motor neuron disease,  Huntington's disease, and Parkinson's disease. The CNS is so unique that studying non-neuronal cells does not provide much assistance. Despite this desperate need, the inaccessibility of human brain cells meant studying them would have been impossible until the recent discovery of cellular reprogramming and induced pluripotent stem cell technology.  Here we propose to form the NeuroLINCS consortium to accomplish these goals. We have handpicked the team to bring in critical expertise in iPSC technology, disease modeling, transcriptomics, epigenomics, metabolomics, whole genome sequencing, proteomics, high content, high throughput longitudinal single cell analysis, other cell-based assays, bioinformatics, statistics and computational biology. In addition, we are collaborating with Google to bring in special expertise in machine learning and the integration of signatures across platforms into highly predictive models of responses to perturbagens. Together, we expect to develop cell signatures of an array of human brain cell types under different conditions that should be broadly applicable to the LINCs community. We also anticipate generating innovative software tools and approaches that will make the signature generating process cheaper, faster, and more reliable.  Besides the unique combination of expertise represented within NeuroLINCS, another distinguishing feature is the long track record that its members have of collaborating with each other. That collaborative spirit will be expressed in NeuroLINCS through its significant and multifaceted community outreach programs. These will involve specific and detailed plans to make the data and tools that NeuroLINCS generates available to the community, to interact with other LINCS sites, and to prepare for DCIC and the prospect of disseminating knowledge and resources at scale. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The cellular signatures of human neurons we identify can be used to provide insights into the molecular factors that distinguish central neurons from healthy people from those of patients with neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS, SMA, PD and HD.

"""Methods from Computational Topology and Geometry for Analysing Neuronal Tree and Graph Data"" Summary Progress from description to quantification is essential as a science matures. Yet numerical analysis of the elementary unit of brain circuitry—the individual neuron—continues to pose methodological challenges. Even the definition of a measurement yardstick (a metric) for the tree shape of a neuron remains an open research problem. Without such metrics, researchers cannot accurately classify neurons into cell types, an essential step toward understanding the circuit components and how they work together. Advanced methods from computational topology and geometry, which have only recently made their way from pure mathematics into data analysis, will be used to extract, characterize, and classify neuronal shapes in a way that elegantly incorporates the underlying dynamical electrophysiological properties. The first specific aim will apply new mathematical methods to define and compute metrics on the shapes of a wide variety of neurons. A computational topological analysis called “persistence summaries” will be used to generate invariant representations of the neurons that can then be compared using different norms. An important strength of this method is that it works flexibly with arbitrary functions defined on the neurons, including purely structural ones (such as distance from the soma) or functions with electrophysiological meaning (such as electrotonic distance or propagation delays) and can therefore incorporate dynamics. A more advanced approach based on the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between metric spaces will be also explored. The metrics so generated will be used for classification and clustering, visualization of the space of neuronal shapes, and shape-based database search for neuronal reconstructions derived from light or electron microscopy. The second aim will use Morse theory to reconstruct individual neurons from light microscopic data, or skeletonize tracer injection data to summarize the structure of projection patterns. This approach retains shape information, which is lost when such data are characterized in a connectivity matrix. Further, these methods will be applied to construct consensus trees, which can be used as a summary of different reconstructions produced by different algorithms. The tools will be freely shared under a suitable open-source software license, and made available via plugins to widely used software platforms as well as web services to a community repository of neuronal morphologies. The team of researchers includes theorists, experimentalists, data scientists, and end users, all with extensive relevant experience. Apart from enabling the understanding of normal brain circuitry in terms of its component neurons, the proposed methods will also allow researchers to characterize changes in the shape of neurons in pathologically altered circuits, with applications to transgenic animal models of disease. Narrative. The complex tree shapes of neurons are important for their role in neuronal circuitry but are mathematically challenging to characterize and analyze. Advanced methods from computational topology and geometry, which have recently made their way from pure mathematics to applications, will be brought to bear on neuronal structure and dynamics by a highly collaborative team combining the necessary expertise. The resulting tools will be made available to neuroscientists studying normal and diseased brain circuitry.","""Methods from Computational Topology and Geometry for Analysing Neuronal Tree and Graph Data""",9170501,R01EB022899,"['abstracting ', ' Algorithms ', ' Transgenic Animals ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Communities ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Negatrons ', ' Negative Beta Particle ', ' Electrons ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' image construction ', ' Image Reconstructions ', ' Imagination ', ' Injections ', ' Injection of therapeutic agent ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Literature ', ' Math ', ' Mathematics ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Electron Microscopy ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Noise ', ' Physiology ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Running ', ' Science ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' Trees ', ' Work ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Measures ', ' Neurites ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Custom ', ' Visualization ', ' Imagery ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Microscopic ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Intuition ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Licensing ', ' Measurement ', ' Letters ', ' Staging ', ' Morphology ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Consensus ', ' light microscopy ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' brain cell ', ' experience ', ' neuron component ', ' soma ', ' neural cell body ', ' neuronal cell body ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' Animal Model ', ' neuronal circuit ', ' neuronal circuitry ', ' Structure ', ' Graph ', ' Property ', ' theories ', ' repository ', ' Data ', ' Collection ', ' Tracer ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Output ', ' web services ', ' cost ', ' reconstruction ', ' scale up ', ' combinatorial ', ' open source ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' Computational Geometry ', ' Geometry ', ' mathematical methods ', ' mathematics methods ', ' mathematics methodology ', ' mathematics approach ', ' mathematical methodology ', ' mathematical approach ', ' math methods ', ' math methodology ', ' brain circuitry ', ' Data Science ', ' Data Scientist ', ' Formulation ', ' ']",NIBIB,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,R01,2016,450322,NY-03,0.04127290873808122
"Experimental examinations of the mechanisms that generate the responses of midbra DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) play central roles in learning and motivation. In tasks involving rewards, they respond in a stereotyped fashion. They are activated by unpredicted rewards. But when a sensory cue predicts reward, they instead start responding to the cue, while their response to reward attenuates. Moreover, when a predicted reward is omitted, their activity is transiently suppressed. From these observations, it has been postulated that dopamine neurons signal discrepancies between expected and actual reward, i.e., they compute the reward prediction error (RPE). However, it remains unknown how dopamine neurons compute RPE. To understand this question, it is important to know (1) what mechanisms suppress dopamine neurons' responses to reward when the reward is expected, and (2) what mechanisms are responsible for generating the response of dopamine neurons to reward-predicting cues. A previous study in our laboratory has shown that VTA GABA neurons exhibit sustained activations during the delay between a reward-predictive cue and reward. This result suggests that VTA GABA neurons suppress dopamine neurons' responses to reward when the reward is expected. In this proposal, to test this idea experimentally, the sustained activity of VTA GABA neurons will be optogenetically manipulated, and how this manipulation affects dopamine neurons' responses to reward will be examined electrophysiologically. Second, although previous studies have shown that the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and the ventral pallidum(VP) provide large numbers of inhibitory inputs to dopamine neurons, and NAc neurons project to VP, the exact roles of these connections in regulating the activity of dopamine neurons remain unclear. In a preliminary experiment, inactivation of unilateral NAc was found to greatly reduce dopamine neurons' responses to reward-predictive cues. We will experimentally test the hypothesis that a disynaptic, inhibitory pathway from NAc to VP to dopamine neurons is responsible in generating dopamine neurons' responses to reward-predictive cues. In total, this project aims to experimentally test the aforementioned specific hypotheses using integrative approaches in mice. Malfunctions of the dopamine system are associated with a variety of pathological conditions including depression, schizophrenia and addiction. By providing a detailed, circuit-level analysis of dopamine neuron firing, we will provide a framework for understanding how the brain learns from rewards, and how this system can be disrupted in disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Malfunction of the midbrain dopamine system is associated with a variety of pathological conditions including depression, schizophrenia and addiction.

"Defining cell types, lineage, and connectivity in developing human fetal cortex ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Little is currently known about the number, proportion, or lineage of distinct cell types in the developing human fetal brain. Knowledge of such a component list and its functional genomic foundations is crucial for understanding the function of this complex system, its evolution, and how it is disrupted in disease. We hypothesize that comprehensive single-cell mRNA expression profiles provide an accurate and efficient rubric for a first generation classification schema that can be integrated with lineage, morphology and connectivity. We will use unsupervised learning algorithms to cluster 10,000 single cell transcriptomes derived from RNAseq of the human fetal cortical anlage, providing an unbiased model to identify and understand the resultant cell classes. We will validate these cell class determinations using in situ hybridization. We will use marker genes identified in this analysis to perform lineage tracing using cell-type specific reporters engineered via genome editing, and obtain single cell transcriptional profiles at different stages of development to determine lineage relationships. Finally, we will analyze intact fetal cerebral hemispheres and mouse-human chimeras processed with the CLARITY technique to provide 3D localization and morphology of a subset of cell types. To markedly improve scalability of this approach, we will apply enhanced Bessel Beam Tomography for spectral image acquisition, increasing imaging speed by 2-3 orders of magnitude while maintaining high resolution. In parallel, we will develop automated image analysis algorithms to enable cell detection and comprehensive morphological assessment in an automated and correctable fashion. Overall, completion of these studies will permit, among many future advances: (1) The generation of an unbiased rubric of cell class based on integration of morphological, transcriptomic, and connectivity data used to understand cell type diversity and function; (2) Connection of cellular function, morphology, and connectivity to specific genes and proteins; (3) Refinement of the cellular basis of transcriptomic disease signatures and understanding of the individual cellular mechanisms of disease (4) The construction of connectivity diagrams based on discovered circuit components allowing development of realistic computational models of brain function and dysfunction; (5) Optimization of cell types generated by in vitro stem cell models based on gold standard in vivo cell class definition; and (6) Advancement of light microscopy techniques for rapid, spectral high resolution imaging of postmortem human and mouse brain including automated processing, which in addition to permitting high throughput brain mapping, will significantly advance mechanistic studies in mouse models and pathological studies in human. Completion of these aims will provide a proof of principle, multiple tools, and a core framework on which to build a more comprehensive knowledge of cell classes in the human brain.

"The behavioral functions of upper and lower cortical layers PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The cerebral cortex mediates all of human and animal cognition, encompassing a diverse set of abilities including sensation, perception, decision making, and motor planning. Dysfunctions of the cerebral cortex are thought to underlie numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders. A major obstacle both to understanding normal behaving and to treating pathology is the high degree of complexity of cortical circuitry, which has remained largely enigmatic. The conventional view of neocortex has been that sensory processing begins in layer 4 (L4), which was identified a century ago as the principal target of thalamic axons carrying information from our sensory organs. Sensory transforms are widely believed to occur as excitation spreads serially along the densest axonal pathways (thalamus→L4→L2/3→L5/6). Recently we discovered that the cerebral cortex, rather than being a monolithic structure, may contain two entirely separate processing systems, activated by the same signals arising from the thalamus. L4 is thus not an obligatory distribution hub for cortical activity, and thalamus activates two distinct “strata” of cortex in parallel.  This proposal's goal is to identify the behavioral and computational roles of the upper (L2-4) and lower strata (L5/6) as well as the interactions between them. We will investigate the behavioral roles of these layers in the mouse whisker system. Specific layers will be optogenetically disrupted in a series of tactile behavioral tasks, in which task complexity is progressively increased. Interlaminar interactions will also be studied by recording electrophysiologically from specific layers during behavior and using novel machine learning techniques designed to identify the type of computation performed in different levels of “deep networks”. The dimensionality of the representation in a layer will be estimated under normal behaviors and when specific layers are inactivated.  Identifying fundamental functions of upper versus cortical layers will likely pave the way for future studies in other neocortical systems and in higher-order species. Moreover, as the different layers contain molecularly and biophysically distinct cell types and project to distinct downstream targets, specific neurological disorders may involve dysfunction of specific pathways, cell types, and layers.

"Thalamic and Cortical Mechanisms of Itch ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Itch is a common clinical problem that is often difficult to treat. There is currently little understanding of the mechanism used in the CNS to produce itch and this likely contributes to the inability to treat itch. In recent years it have become cler that information related to itch is carried in the periphery and spinal cord by neurons that are also activated by noxious stimuli. This suggests that information necessary for the production of itch in the brain must be extracted from the responses of polysensory neurons in a process called decoding. The proposed studies, will for the first time, use single unit electrophysiologica techniques to determine the areas in the thalamus and cortex where processing of pruriceptive information occurs. The responses of single neurons in the thalamus to various itch-and pain-producing stimuli will be determined. The cortical areas to which pruriceptive thalamic neurons project will be determined using antidromic activation methods. In addition, responses of individual cortical neurons to pruritogens and pain-producing stimuli will be determined. The proposed studies will determine the thalamic nuclei and cortical areas in which processing of information related to itch and pain occur. In addition, using a Machine Learning approach, we will determine the contributions of the intensity and pattern of action potentials within responses to differential coding of itch and pain related responses. The proposed studies will considerably expand our understanding of the CNS mechanisms that produce itch and pain.        RELEVANCE: Very little is known about the neural systems in the thalamus and cerebral cortex that underlie production of the sensation of itch. This lack of understanding likely contributes to the paucity of effective treatments for the majority of types of chronic itch. The proposed studies will determine the areas in the thalamus and cortex in which single neurons process and transmit information about itch and pain.

"CRCNS:  Neural coding and computation in large ensembles in prefrontal cortex ﻿PROJECT SUMMARY The essence of cognition is choice, and to understand choice we need to understand the brain mechanisms that guide decisions in complex settings. These mechanisms are implemented through interactions of large neural networks across cortical and subcortical areas. Tracking population response dynamics on single trials and relating them to internal cognitive states and overt behavior are critical for incisive tests of current models of decision-making. Here we propose to characterize the activity patterns of large populations of neurons (100+) in the prefrontal cortex of macaque monkeys engaged in decision-making tasks. We will explain the spatiotemporal patterns of activation in the population by developing the most parsimonious probabilistic model that takes into account pairwise and higher-order interactions of neurons. The model will be utilized to characterize response manifolds of the network and quantify its dynamics in different task epochs. Our approach is unique because rather than trying to embed the population dynamics in a low dimensional manifold using Machine Learning tools, we propose to extend the Maximum Entropy framework to directly capture the high-dimensional dynamics. Further, by characterizing functional dependencies among cells we can map the architecture and design of large networks in terms of subnetwork motifs and computations. Finally, we will investigate how noisy fluctuations of responses or artificial manipulation of network activity influences its dynamics and modifies or disturbs its computations. Scrutinizing the results of these experiments within our modeling framework makes headway toward addressing long-standing questions about decision-making, including the neural basis of psychological models and effects of initial state on the behavior.  Our work will have broader impacts in two domains. First, the path that we will chart for discovering functional subnetworks and their computations will be useable in various subfields of neuroscience. We will significantly advance data analysis and computational modeling tools available to neuroscientists and, therefore, will facilitate future studies of normal mental functions and mental disorders using high-dimensional neural data. Second, characterizing information encoding and response dynamics in the prefrontal cortex sheds light on mechanisms of decision-making and emergence of cognitive abilities in complex neural networks. Deficits of decision-making are at the heart of a number of neurological and psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's disease. Several behavioral and pharmacological therapies have been proposed for those deficits, but we lack a clear understanding of how they work at the level of neuronal systems. To develop the next generation of therapies, we need to understand how cognitive processes emerge across multiple functional levels, from individual neurons to networks of brain areas. Our work is a step in that direction. It has the potential to advance our understanding of pathology of mental disorders and help with the discovery of better treatments. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this proposal is to develop a computational framework that accurately captures response dynamics of a population of prefrontal neurons during decision-making. We will simultaneously measure and manipulate the activity of one hundred or more prefrontal neurons and develop computational models that explain the response dynamics of the prefrontal network.

"Cerebellar network mapping with a high-throughput TEM platform Project Summary/Abstract A fundamental goal in neuroscience is to understand how information is processed in neuronal circuits. Ultimately, we would like to understand the relationship between circuit structure and network function. However, the immense complexity of most brain networks has been a significant barrier to progress. Neurons are a primary computational component of networks in the brain, yet we do not have a comprehensive list of their types for even the simplest mammalian neuronal circuit. Moreover, a neuron’s function is fundamentally dependent on how it is connected within its network, yet mammalian neuronal networks consist of billions of cells with trillions of connections. How can we get a handle on such a complex computational machine? Recent advances in large-scale electron microscopy (EM) and molecular genetic tools have allowed us to begin detailed mapping of neural network anatomy and cellular physiology. The cerebellum is an excellent system to validate our novel platform as part of a systematic effort to reverse engineer a functional neural circuit that is involved in motor control and social behavior. Its basic structure is well ordered, relatively simple and sufficiently described to have inspired computational models that capture aspects of cerebellar function. However, even the most advanced models are limited by an incomplete characterization of the cell types and connectivity within the cerebellum. Here, we propose to validate our next-generation large-scale EM platform and provide a comprehensive characterization of cerebellar circuitry. We will use tools recently developed in our lab to a circuit that offers the advantages of relative simplicity and a strong starting foundation. These studies will allow us to understand principles of cerebellar circuit organization and may help us determine the role of specific circuit elements in neurodegenerative disorders. Project Narrative The goal of this proposal is to understand the organizational principles underlying cerebellar circuits. We will use large-scale electron microscopy to extract cerebellar network anatomy.

"CRCNS: Sensory-Motor Integration in Mammalian Brian: experiment, analysis, modeling A major goal facing organisms acting in the natural world is the selection of appropriate actions based on sensory information and prior knowledge accumulated through previous experience. Understanding how neural networks process information and control such actions requires a breakthrough both in large scale chronic data collection methods during behavioral tasks and in the development of new analysis and modeling tools that will be able to capture the dynamics and organization of such neural networks. To address key questions in the context of sensory-motor control and learning we propose a multidisciplinary approach that will synergize the expertise of the four groups involved in cellular and systems neuroscience, machine learning, signal processing, control theory and modeling. Our goal is to establish an empirically-grounded systems-level model explaining the interaction and integration within the sensory-motor system during behavioral tasks, which is consistent with the experimental data, and which provides concrete predictions for future experiments. More specifically, we intend to further our understanding on two main fronts. First, study cell type specific components that participate in the movement command and in sensory-motor error prediction. We hypothesize that layer 2-3 neurons subserve different roles from layer 5 neurons, and may be more strongly involved in error estimation rather than in control. Second, we intend to investigate whether and how the sensory and motor ends change in order to adapt to the new learned task. Here again we expect differences between the different cortical layers. Such a framework will not only provide new insights into the specific investigated system, but could be transferrable more generally to probe the structure and functionality of complex biological networks. In addition, the unique analysis methods developed and the deep understanding of biological sensory-motor systems may contribute invaluably to fields such as robotics and network control, and to the development of new prosthetics approaches within the field of Brain Computer Interfaces. RELEVANCE (See instructions): The goals of this research proposal are expected to provide novel insight on sensory-motor control as well as structural and functional plasticity processes of the cortical network during sensory-motor learning.

"Experimental examinations of the mechanisms that generate the responses of midbra DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) play central roles in learning and motivation. In tasks involving rewards, they respond in a stereotyped fashion. They are activated by unpredicted rewards. But when a sensory cue predicts reward, they instead start responding to the cue, while their response to reward attenuates. Moreover, when a predicted reward is omitted, their activity is transiently suppressed. From these observations, it has been postulated that dopamine neurons signal discrepancies between expected and actual reward, i.e., they compute the reward prediction error (RPE). However, it remains unknown how dopamine neurons compute RPE. To understand this question, it is important to know (1) what mechanisms suppress dopamine neurons' responses to reward when the reward is expected, and (2) what mechanisms are responsible for generating the response of dopamine neurons to reward-predicting cues. A previous study in our laboratory has shown that VTA GABA neurons exhibit sustained activations during the delay between a reward-predictive cue and reward. This result suggests that VTA GABA neurons suppress dopamine neurons' responses to reward when the reward is expected. In this proposal, to test this idea experimentally, the sustained activity of VTA GABA neurons will be optogenetically manipulated, and how this manipulation affects dopamine neurons' responses to reward will be examined electrophysiologically. Second, although previous studies have shown that the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and the ventral pallidum(VP) provide large numbers of inhibitory inputs to dopamine neurons, and NAc neurons project to VP, the exact roles of these connections in regulating the activity of dopamine neurons remain unclear. In a preliminary experiment, inactivation of unilateral NAc was found to greatly reduce dopamine neurons' responses to reward-predictive cues. We will experimentally test the hypothesis that a disynaptic, inhibitory pathway from NAc to VP to dopamine neurons is responsible in generating dopamine neurons' responses to reward-predictive cues. In total, this project aims to experimentally test the aforementioned specific hypotheses using integrative approaches in mice. Malfunctions of the dopamine system are associated with a variety of pathological conditions including depression, schizophrenia and addiction. By providing a detailed, circuit-level analysis of dopamine neuron firing, we will provide a framework for understanding how the brain learns from rewards, and how this system can be disrupted in disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Malfunction of the midbrain dopamine system is associated with a variety of pathological conditions including depression, schizophrenia and addiction.

"Neural mechanisms for reducing interference during episodic memory formation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One of the biggest challenges to successful remembering is the potential for confusion or interference between similar memories. For every password, name, or parking space that we store in memory, there are many other passwords, names or parking spaces that we have already learned or will learn in the future. While interference is a factor in relatively benign-yet annoying-examples of 'normal' forgetting, it is aso a major factor in clinically significant examples of forgetting that occur with aging and/or dementia. Thus, there is a fundamental need to understand the neural mechanisms that support the acquisition/retrieval of similar memories while minimizing interference and corresponding forgetting. Computational models of episodic memory have proposed two core mechanisms that are thought to reduce interference-related forgetting: integration and pattern separation. Integration involves 'fusing' overlapping memories into a common representation such that the relationship between these memories is more complementary than competitive. Pattern separation involves the orthogonalization of similar memories such that differences between memories are exaggerated and the potential for interference minimized. While there is general agreement that these mechanisms are theoretically appealing and offer clear computational advantages, clear evidence for how and when these learning mechanisms are invoked- particularly in humans-remains surprisingly limited? In particular, there remains ambiguity as far as (a) the learning contexts in which each mechanism might be recruited, (b) what the corresponding neural signatures of each mechanism are, and (c) the specific behavioral consequences associated with the engagement of each mechanism. We propose a systematic investigation of the contexts in which integration and pattern separation occur with the goal of using sophisticated, cutting-edge neuroimaging (fMRI) techniques to identify distributed patterns of neural activity that are diagnostic of each mechanism. Critically, we also plan to use these observed patterns of neural activity-that is, neural evidence for integration vs. separation-to predict behavioral memory phenomena, including interference-related forgetting. The research represents a strong synthesis of psychology and neuroscience questions with an emphasis on learning mechanisms inspired by computational models and analysis approaches that draw from the fields of machine learning and data mining.

"Software for Automated Reconstruction of Structure & Dynamics of Neural Circuits ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our understanding of brain functions is hindered by the lack of detailed knowledge of synaptic connectivity in the underlying neural network. While synaptic connectivity of small neural circuits can be determined with electron microscopy, studies of connectivity on a larger scale, e.g. whole mouse brain, must be based on light microscopy imaging. It is now possible to fluorescently label subsets of neurons in vivo and image their axonal and dendritic arbors in 3D from multiple brain tissue sections. The overwhelming remaining challenge is neurite tracing, which must be done automatically due to the high-throughput nature of the problem. Currently, there are no automated tools that have the capacity to perform tracing tasks on the scale of mammalian neural circuits. Needless to say, the existence of such a tool is critical both for basic mapping of synaptic connectivity in normal brains, as well as for describing the changes in the nervous system which underlie neurological disorders. With this proposal we plan to continue the development of Neural Circuit Tracer - software for accurate, automated reconstruction of the structure and dynamics of neurites from 3D light microscopy stacks of images. Our goal is to revolutionize the existing functionalities of the software, making it possible to: (i) automatically reconstruct axonal and dendritic arbors of sparsely labeled populations of neurons from multiple stacks of images and (ii) automatically track and quantify changes in the structures of presynaptic boutons and dendritic spines imaged over time. We propose to utilize the latest machine learning and image processing techniques to develop multi-stack tracing, feature detection, and computer-guided trace editing capabilities of the software. All tools and datasets created as part of this proposal will be made available to the research community. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: At present, accurate methods of analysis of neuron morphology and synaptic connectivity rely on manual or semi-automated tracing tools. Such methods are time consuming, can be prone to errors, and do not scale up to the level of large brain-mapping projects.

"The behavioral functions of upper and lower cortical layers PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The cerebral cortex mediates all of human and animal cognition, encompassing a diverse set of abilities including sensation, perception, decision making, and motor planning. Dysfunctions of the cerebral cortex are thought to underlie numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders. A major obstacle both to understanding normal behaving and to treating pathology is the high degree of complexity of cortical circuitry, which has remained largely enigmatic. The conventional view of neocortex has been that sensory processing begins in layer 4 (L4), which was identified a century ago as the principal target of thalamic axons carrying information from our sensory organs. Sensory transforms are widely believed to occur as excitation spreads serially along the densest axonal pathways (thalamus→L4→L2/3→L5/6). Recently we discovered that the cerebral cortex, rather than being a monolithic structure, may contain two entirely separate processing systems, activated by the same signals arising from the thalamus. L4 is thus not an obligatory distribution hub for cortical activity, and thalamus activates two distinct “strata” of cortex in parallel.  This proposal's goal is to identify the behavioral and computational roles of the upper (L2-4) and lower strata (L5/6) as well as the interactions between them. We will investigate the behavioral roles of these layers in the mouse whisker system. Specific layers will be optogenetically disrupted in a series of tactile behavioral tasks, in which task complexity is progressively increased. Interlaminar interactions will also be studied by recording electrophysiologically from specific layers during behavior and using novel machine learning techniques designed to identify the type of computation performed in different levels of “deep networks”. The dimensionality of the representation in a layer will be estimated under normal behaviors and when specific layers are inactivated.  Identifying fundamental functions of upper versus cortical layers will likely pave the way for future studies in other neocortical systems and in higher-order species. Moreover, as the different layers contain molecularly and biophysically distinct cell types and project to distinct downstream targets, specific neurological disorders may involve dysfunction of specific pathways, cell types, and layers. Establishing the behavioral and computational roles of these elements may contribute to development of targeted therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Dysfunctions of the cerebral cortex are thought to underlie numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders, but the behavioral and functional roles of cortical layers and cell types are unknown. Identifying the contributions of specific cortical layers to normal circuit function will lead to better treatment of pathological conditions.     ",The behavioral functions of upper and lower cortical layers,9313955,R01NS094659,"['Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Spinal Cord ', ' Medulla Spinalis ', ' Synapses ', ' synapse ', ' Synaptic ', ' Task Performances ', ' Testing ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' thalamic ', ' Thalamus ', ' Whiskers ', ' Vibrissae ', ' Halorhodopsin Chromoprotein ', ' Halorhodopsins ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' neopallium ', ' isocortex ', ' homotypical cortex ', ' Neocortex ', ' Organ ', ' Area ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Morphology ', ' Shapes ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Dimensions ', ' Tactile ', ' Auditory ', ' Complex ', ' Sensory ', ' Source ', ' cell type ', ' Texture ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Performance ', ' sensory discrimination ', ' Structure ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' Modality ', ' response ', ' object shape ', ' Detection ', ' Motor ', ' Sensory Physiology ', ' Pathologic ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Output ', ' Pyramidal neuron ', ' hippocampal pyramidal neuron ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' neocortical ', ' spatial integration ', ' optogenetics ', ' biophysical properties ', ' biophysical parameters ', ' biophysical measurement ', ' biophysical characterization ', ' biophysical characteristics ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted therapy ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' Animals ', ' Axon ', ' Behavior ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' Biophysics ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Cerebral cortex ', ' Cognition ', ' striatal ', ' Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Decision Making ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Elements ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Mus ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurons ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Pathology ', ' Perception ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Esthesia ', ' Sensation ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' ']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2017,350000,NY-13,0.016104323019090785
"Deciphering the building blocks of hippocampal circuits   Abstract   Since  Ramon  y  Cajal,  neuroscientists  have  speculated  that  even  the  most  complex  brain  functions  might  eventually be understood at the level of neuronal cell types and their connections. Unfortunately, our under‐ standing of the brain's extensive diversity of cell types and elaborate circuitry remains far from complete. For  example, despite the hippocampus being essential for learning and memory and its dysfunction underlying a  wide variety of devastating neuropsychiatric disorders, we still lack fundamental knowledge about its constit‐ uent cell types and their molecular profiles and connectivity, slowing progress towards a mechanistic circuit‐ level understanding of memory formation. We propose to identify all of the interneuron cell types in area CA1  of the hippocampus and decipher their canonical connectivity. We have assembled a strong interdisciplinary  team  capable  of  combining  cutting‐edge  technologies  including  high‐throughput  multi‐cell  patch  recordings,  morphological reconstructions, single‐cell RNA sequencing, and machine learning to achieve two main goals:  1) dissect CA1 microcircuit organization by generating a morphological and electrophysiological taxonomy of  all interneuron cell types in mouse CA1 and map their connections; and 2) derive transcriptomic signatures of  morphologically defined CA1 interneurons using our newly developed Patch‐seq method. Our team recently  implemented  this  interdisciplinary  experimental  strategy  to  successfully  identify  cell  types  in  the  neocortex  and dissect their microcircuitry. Using multi‐cell patch clamp recording, we will characterize the electrophysi‐ ological properties, morphology, laminar location and connectivity of thousands of neurons from mouse CA1  hippocampus. We will also utilize a new, highly sensitive, cost effective technique for single‐cell RNA sequenc‐ ing (Smart‐seq2) to map their transcriptomes and machine learning techniques to classify cells into molecular  types.  Importantly,  our  high‐throughput  method  will  allow  us  to  obtain  morphological,  electrophysiological  and  complete  transcriptome  information  for  single  neurons,  which  cannot  be  achieved  using  other  methods  such as dissociating tissue for single‐cell sequencing. In‐house customization and automation has reduced our  sequencing costs, enabling us to sequence thousands of cells within a reasonable budget. Cell type identifica‐ tion will be validated using morphological, electrophysiological, and molecular tests. Identifying all of the in‐ terneuron  cell  types  that  comprise  CA1  and  determining  how  they  connect  to  each  other  will  have  a  broad,  paradigm‐shifting impact. For instance, it will contribute to a circuit‐level understanding of the computations  that take place in CA1, such as memory formation. From a clinical perspective, single‐cell transcriptome data  will yield a powerful atlas to investigate relationships between cell types and genes related to neuropsychiatric  diseases and facilitate cell‐type engineering.       Narrative  The  hippocampus  is  a  complex  brain  structure  that  mediates  remarkable  mental  functions  like  learning  and  memory, while its malfunction is associated with devastating neuropsychiatric diseases including Alzheimer's

"Mechanisms of neural circuit dynamics in working memory anddecision-making Project Summary Working memory, the ability to temporarily hold multiple pieces of information in mind for manipulation, is central to virtually all cognitive abilities. Recent technical advances have opened an unprecedented opportunity to comprehensively dissect the neural circuit mechanisms of this ability across multiple brain areas. The task to be studied is a common form of decision-making that is based on the gradual accumulation of sensory evidence and thus relies on working memory. A team of leading experts propose to investigate the neural basis of this behavior using the latest techniques, including virtual reality, high-throughput automated behavioral training, large-scale cellular-resolution imaging in behaving rodents, manipulation of neural activity in specific brain areas and cell types, and automated anatomical reconstruction. In particular, the researchers will identify key brain regions that are required for this decision task through systematic, temporally specific inactivations via optogenetics technology, across all of dorsal cortex and in key subcortical areas, and use quantitative model-fitting to evaluate the effects. They will use state-of-the-art two-photon calcium imaging methods and electrophysiology to characterize the information flow in many individual neurons within these brain areas during the task. In addition, they will use cutting-edge anatomical reconstructions and new functional connectivity methods, within and across brain regions, to evaluate the interactions of these physiologically characterized neurons. The long-term goal of this project is to arrive at a complete, brain-wide understanding of the cellular and circuit mechanisms of activity dynamics related to working memory. Finally, they will use sophisticated computational methods to incorporate this new understanding into a realistic circuit model that will support a tightly integrated process of model-guided experimental design, in which the model suggests the most informative experiments and their results are then fed back to improve the model’s fidelity. This process is expected to produce the most accurate and detailed multi-brain-region biophysical circuit model of a cognitive process in existence. In addition, the proposed research will enable researchers to generate and test a variety of hypotheses about the neural basis of evidence accumulation, working memory, and decision-making. Taken together, these achievements will represent a crucial step toward a mechanistic understanding of how the brain works with information. Working memory, the capacity to temporarily hold multiple pieces of information in mind for manipulation , is central to almost all cognitive abilities. Many mental diseases, including Alzheimer’s, schizophrenia, dementia, bipolar depression, autism, and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, involve working memory. The major goal of this project is to determine how the brain produces decisions based on working memory, via a coordinated effort by multiple researchers to observe, map, perturb, and model brain circuits with state-of-the-art technologies, which will provide critical clues to therapeutic approaches and constitute a major advance in basic science.",Mechanisms of neural circuit dynamics in working memory anddecision-making,9444124,U19NS104648,"['Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomy ', ' Animals ', ' Atlases ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' Infantile Autism ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Automation ', ' Dorsum ', ' Back ', ' Behavior ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' Biophysics ', ' bipolar depressed ', ' Bipolar Depression ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Factor IV ', ' Coagulation Factor IV ', ' Ca++ element ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor IV ', ' Calcium ', ' Cerebellum ', ' Cognition ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Decision Making ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Goals ', ' instrumentation ', ' Maps ', ' working memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Microscopy ', ' Molecular Probes ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' optical ', ' Optics ', ' Quality Control ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Support ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Rodentia ', ' Running ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Ventral Tegmental Area ', ' ventral tegmentum ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Dorsal ', ' Area ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Training ', ' Structure of thyroid parafollicular cell ', ' Parafollicular Cell ', ' C Cell ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' Individual ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Collaborations ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Pulse ', ' Complex ', ' Sensory ', ' cell type ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' member ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' neural circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' virtual reality ', ' virtual world ', ' virtual environment ', ' VR simulation ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Hyperactivity Disorder NOS ', ' ADHD ', ' AD/HD ', ' Brain region ', ' imaging modality ', ' imaging method ', ' image-based method ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' cost ', ' 2-photon ', ' two-photon ', ' reconstruction ', ' virtual ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' scale up ', ' Population ', ' Mind ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' network models ', ' information processing ', ' optogenetics ', ' cognitive process ', ' cognitive ability ', ' Data Science ', ' Data Scientist ', ' data to knowledge ', ' data into knowledge ', ' social computing ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' ']",NINDS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,U19,2017,3087282,NJ-12,-0.06249535405645809
"MACHINE LEARNING APPROACHES FOR ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL CELL CLASSIFICATION ABSTRACT We will use our expertise in somatosensory organization and plasticity to develop novel and automated solutions for cell identification based upon neural activity, in order to decode the algorithms neural circuits use for information processing. Extracellular recordings in sensory cortex have been thought to primarily represent excitatory neuron activity, since these cells comprise ~80% of the total cell population. However, targeted cell recordings in S1 reveal that firing activity is dominated by inhibitory neurons, and that excitatory neurons can show 10-100 fold lower firing rates depending on cortical layer. Furthermore, new findings that reveal the complex relationship between different subtypes of inhibitory neurons make it difficult to relate blindly-recorded firing activity to local- or network-level computations. Clearly, cell-types matter, and massively parallel extracellular recordings that do not enable the simultaneous identification of multiple cell types will be limited in identifying principles for information transmission and encoding. Based on our preliminary findings, we hypothesize that the complex spontaneous and evoked spike trains from molecularly-identified neurons will provide unique and cell-type specific signatures that will enable cell identification from in vivo extracellular recordings. In collaboration with computer scientists at Carnegie Mellon, we will develop machine-learning algorithms for cell classification, using data collected from in vitro and in vivo recordings. NARRATIVE  Discovery of the Rosetta stone was an archaeological breakthrough, enabling translation of Egyptian hieroglyphics from parallel texts in ancient Greek. Understanding how the activity of different neuronal subtypes contributes to information processing in the brain is in desperate need of a similar cipher. Detailed studies in the cerebral cortex have revealed principles of how small groups of neurons work together, but these small-scale interactions have been difficult to relate to computations performed by larger groups of neurons, typically recorded without knowledge of cell identity, during animal perception and behavior. We will use advances in molecular-cell identification techniques and machine learning to create an automated classifier to decipher cell identity from dense electrophysiological recordings and decode brain function from neural activity.",MACHINE LEARNING APPROACHES FOR ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL CELL CLASSIFICATION,9449797,R21NS104821,"['Algorithms ', ' Animals ', ' Archaeology ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Architecture ', ' Behavior ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Cerebral cortex ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Cognition ', ' Computers ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Dissent ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Goals ', ' In Vitro ', ' Interneurons ', ' Internuncial Neuron ', ' Internuncial Cell ', ' Intercalated Neurons ', ' Intercalary Neuron ', ' Connector Neuron ', ' Methods ', ' Mus ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Neurons ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Parvalbumins ', ' Perception ', ' Publishing ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Somatostatin ', ' growth hormone release inhibiting factor ', ' Somatotropin Release-Inhibiting Hormone ', ' Somatotropin Release Inhibiting Factors ', ' Somatostatin-14 ', ' SRIH-14 ', ' SRIH ', ' Growth Hormone-Inhibiting Hormone ', ' Growth Hormone Inhibiting Factors ', ' Cyclic Somatostatin ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' thalamic ', ' Thalamus ', ' Translations ', ' Work ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Fiber ', ' Clear Cell ', ' Stimulus ', ' awake ', ' Collaborations ', ' Greek ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Distant ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' extracellular ', ' Performance ', ' sensory cortex ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' novel ', ' Neurophysiology - biologic function ', ' neural function ', ' Cortical Column ', ' Renal Column of Bertini ', ' Column of Bertini ', ' neural circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' Data ', ' in vivo ', ' Collection ', ' Slice ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Molecular ', ' Text ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' excitatory neuron ', ' inhibitory neuron ', ' virtual ', ' Population ', ' somatosensory ', ' information processing ', ' optogenetics ', ' cognitive process ', ' behavioral response ', ' behavior response ', ' ']",NINDS,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R21,2017,237150,PA-18,0.046564791205141155
"Compressive Light Field microscopy for optogenetic neural activity tracking SUMMARY: Understanding the mechanisms by which the living brain derives perception, cognition and behavior requires the ability to record and control electrical activity in many neurons simultaneously. Completely reconstructing the pattern of neural activity that mediates a specific neural operation is critical for fully understanding its underlying mechanism. This requires an approach that can measure neural activity on a large scale with high spatial and temporal resolution. Functional imaging of genetically encoded activity sensors is one of the most promising avenues towards achieving this goal because it permits dense sampling and unambiguous separation of nearby neurons1, 2. However, even techniques currently available cannot capture neural activity in large volumes of the brain simultaneously, at high speed, and with cellular resolution. Furthermore, these existing approaches rely on expensive and sophisticated hardware, and cannot be readily adapted for imaging in unrestrained animals. Since a central goal of the BRAIN initiative is to achieve large-scale recording of neural activity in behaving animals, a new imaging approach is needed to overcome these technical challenges.  To achieve high speed, volumetric imaging in a compact and inexpensive device, we propose to develop a new imaging modality - compressive four-dimensional (4D) light field microscopy (LFM). In this approach, we will combine the advantages of light field microscopy with compressed sensing to extract the activity of thousands of individual neurons with high spatial and temporal resolution, through scattering tissue. In conventional microscopy, the photo-detector only samples the intensity of photons. In LFM, the sensor also captures the angle of the light. This allows 3D reconstruction, since position and angle enable back-tracing of rays of light. Such a scheme can be achieved simply by placing a lenslet array in the imaging pathway (Fig. 1A). The resulting 4D light field gives complete volumetric data at each time frame3-6. 3D activity can thus be sampled at camera-limited frame rates, much faster than conventional methods such as multiphoton or light sheet microscopy. For these reasons, LFM for functional brain imaging could revolutionize experimental neuroscience.  Unfortunately, imaging methods which operate in the one-photon regime suffer from light scattering. To image activity in the mammalian brain, we must consider the effects of tissue scattering through the 3D volume. We propose to apply a new approach to processing light field data for better reconstructions of neurons through scattering media37,38. Since the effect of scattering is to spread the angles of propagation of light, measuring angle information inherently helps to characterize and mitigate scatter effects. Our method leverages compressed sensing algorithms, which exploit the sparsity of the light emission in 3D space and time. Importantly, the volume and resolution limits of our method are not set by the number of pixels captured, but rather by the number of active neurons at any given time. Thus, we will be able to localize and measure the activity of thousands or millions of individually active neurons in large volumes of cerebral cortical tissue. Project Narrative This project will develop new optical imaging techniques for real-time neural activity tracking across large volumes of scattering brain tissue.

"""Methods from Computational Topology and Geometry for Analysing Neuronal Tree and Graph Data"" Summary Progress from description to quantification is essential as a science matures. Yet numerical analysis of the elementary unit of brain circuitry—the individual neuron—continues to pose methodological challenges. Even the definition of a measurement yardstick (a metric) for the tree shape of a neuron remains an open research problem. Without such metrics, researchers cannot accurately classify neurons into cell types, an essential step toward understanding the circuit components and how they work together. Advanced methods from computational topology and geometry, which have only recently made their way from pure mathematics into data analysis, will be used to extract, characterize, and classify neuronal shapes in a way that elegantly incorporates the underlying dynamical electrophysiological properties. The first specific aim will apply new mathematical methods to define and compute metrics on the shapes of a wide variety of neurons. A computational topological analysis called “persistence summaries” will be used to generate invariant representations of the neurons that can then be compared using different norms. An important strength of this method is that it works flexibly with arbitrary functions defined on the neurons, including purely structural ones (such as distance from the soma) or functions with electrophysiological meaning (such as electrotonic distance or propagation delays) and can therefore incorporate dynamics. A more advanced approach based on the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between metric spaces will be also explored. The metrics so generated will be used for classification and clustering, visualization of the space of neuronal shapes, and shape-based database search for neuronal reconstructions derived from light or electron microscopy. The second aim will use Morse theory to reconstruct individual neurons from light microscopic data, or skeletonize tracer injection data to summarize the structure of projection patterns. This approach retains shape information, which is lost when such data are characterized in a connectivity matrix. Further, these methods will be applied to construct consensus trees, which can be used as a summary of different reconstructions produced by different algorithms. The tools will be freely shared under a suitable open-source software license, and made available via plugins to widely used software platforms as well as web services to a community repository of neuronal morphologies. The team of researchers includes theorists, experimentalists, data scientists, and end users, all with extensive relevant experience. Apart from enabling the understanding of normal brain circuitry in terms of its component neurons, the proposed methods will also allow researchers to characterize changes in the shape of neurons in pathologically altered circuits, with applications to transgenic animal models of disease. Narrative. The complex tree shapes of neurons are important for their role in neuronal circuitry but are mathematically challenging to characterize and analyze. Advanced methods from computational topology and geometry, which have recently made their way from pure mathematics to applications, will be brought to bear on neuronal structure and dynamics by a highly collaborative team combining the necessary expertise. The resulting tools will be made available to neuroscientists studying normal and diseased brain circuitry.","""Methods from Computational Topology and Geometry for Analysing Neuronal Tree and Graph Data""",9360109,R01EB022899,"['Algorithms ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomy ', ' Transgenic Animals ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Communities ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Animal Disease Models ', ' Negatrons ', ' Negative Beta Particle ', ' Electrons ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' image reconstruction ', ' image generation ', ' image construction ', ' Imagination ', ' Injection of therapeutic agent ', ' Injections ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Literature ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Electron Microscopy ', ' Neurons ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Noise ', ' Physiology ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' Science ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' Trees ', ' Work ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Measures ', ' Neurites ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Custom ', ' Visualization ', ' Imagery ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Microscopic ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Intuition ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Licensing ', ' Measurement ', ' Letters ', ' Morphology ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Consensus ', ' light microscopy ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' neuron component ', ' neuronal cell body ', ' soma ', ' neural cell body ', ' neuronal circuitry ', ' neuronal circuit ', ' Structure ', ' Graph ', ' Skeleton ', ' Property ', ' theories ', ' repository ', ' Alpha Cell ', ' α-cell ', ' Glucagon Secreting Cell ', ' Glucagon Cell ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Collection ', ' Pathologic ', ' Tracer ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Output ', ' web-based service ', ' web services ', ' vector ', ' cost ', ' reconstruction ', ' visualization tool ', ' Visualization software ', ' scale up ', ' combinatorial ', ' open source ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' Computational Geometry ', ' Geometry ', ' mathematical methods ', ' mathematics methods ', ' mathematics methodology ', ' mathematics approach ', ' mathematical methodology ', ' mathematical approach ', ' math methods ', ' math methodology ', ' brain circuitry ', ' Data Science ', ' Data Scientist ', ' Formulation ', ' ']",NIBIB,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,R01,2017,425138,NY-03,0.04127290873808122
"Neuron and Glial Cellular Signatures from Normal and Diseased iPS Cells     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a critical need to define the state and predict the behavior of human brain cells in health and disease. The number of different cell types in the CNS remains undefined, and despite a demographically ordained wave of neurodegenerative diseases, not a single disease-modifying therapy exists. Our  knowledge of the CNS and the foundation for intervening rationally in disease would be dramatically  advanced by generating quantitative molecular phenotypes essentially cell signatures of human neurons,  astrocytes and oligodendrocytes from healthy people and from patients with motor neuron disease,  Huntington's disease, and Parkinson's disease. The CNS is so unique that studying non-neuronal cells does not provide much assistance. Despite this desperate need, the inaccessibility of human brain cells meant studying them would have been impossible until the recent discovery of cellular reprogramming and induced pluripotent stem cell technology.  Here we propose to form the NeuroLINCS consortium to accomplish these goals. We have handpicked the team to bring in critical expertise in iPSC technology, disease modeling, transcriptomics, epigenomics, metabolomics, whole genome sequencing, proteomics, high content, high throughput longitudinal single cell analysis, other cell-based assays, bioinformatics, statistics and computational biology. In addition, we are collaborating with Google to bring in special expertise in machine learning and the integration of signatures across platforms into highly predictive models of responses to perturbagens. Together, we expect to develop cell signatures of an array of human brain cell types under different conditions that should be broadly applicable to the LINCs community. We also anticipate generating innovative software tools and approaches that will make the signature generating process cheaper, faster, and more reliable.  Besides the unique combination of expertise represented within NeuroLINCS, another distinguishing feature is the long track record that its members have of collaborating with each other. That collaborative spirit will be expressed in NeuroLINCS through its significant and multifaceted community outreach programs. These will involve specific and detailed plans to make the data and tools that NeuroLINCS generates available to the community, to interact with other LINCS sites, and to prepare for DCIC and the prospect of disseminating knowledge and resources at scale.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The cellular signatures of human neurons we identify can be used to provide insights into the molecular factors that distinguish central neurons from healthy people from those of patients with neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS, SMA, PD and HD. These insights will provide molecular targets that can be used to develop new drugs to block the progression of these diseases which are presently untreatable.            ",Neuron and Glial Cellular Signatures from Normal and Diseased iPS Cells,9352374,U54NS091046,"['Affect ', ' astrocytic glia ', ' Astroglia ', ' Astrocytus ', ' Astrocytes ', ' Behavior ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cell Differentiation ', ' Cell Differentiation process ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Communities ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Foundations ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Huntingtons Disease ', "" Huntington's Disease Pathway "", "" Huntington's Disease "", "" Huntington's "", ' Huntington Chorea ', ' Huntington Disease ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Libraries ', ' Motor Neurons ', ' motoneuron ', ' Motor Cell ', ' Spinal Muscular Atrophy ', ' Cruveilhier disease ', ' Aran-Duchenne disease ', ' Persons ', ' Neuroglia ', ' nerve cement ', ' Non-neuronal cell ', ' Neuroglial Cells ', "" Kolliker's reticulum "", ' Glial Cells ', ' Glia ', ' Neurons ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Oligodendroglia ', ' Oligodendroglia Cell ', ' Oligodendrocytus ', ' Oligodendrocytes ', ' Online Systems ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Parkinsons disease ', "" Parkinson's disease "", "" Parkinson's "", ' Parkinson ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Patients ', ' Physiology ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' statistics ', ' Stem cells ', ' Progenitor Cells ', ' Technology ', ' Textbooks ', ' Time ', ' degenerative disorder of motor neurons ', ' Motor Neuron Disease ', ' Signal Transduction Pathway ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' cancer cell ', ' Malignant Cell ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Computational Biology ', ' computer biology ', ' Knowledge ', ' Cellular biology ', ' cell biology ', ' Scientist ', ' Inherited ', ' Hereditary ', ' Complex ', ' cell type ', ' Neurodegenerative Disorders ', ' neurodegenerative illness ', ' degenerative neurological diseases ', ' degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons ', ' Neurologic Degenerative Conditions ', ' Neurodegenerative Diseases ', ' Neuro-degenerative Disorders ', ' Neural degenerative Disorders ', ' Neural Degenerative Diseases ', ' Nervous System Degenerative Diseases ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Disorders ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Diseases ', ' brain cell ', ' receptor ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' single cell analysis ', ' Scourge ', ' Structure ', ' member ', ' Disease model ', ' disorder model ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' outreach program ', ' response ', ' Proteomics ', ' Neuraxis ', ' Central Nervous System ', ' CNS Nervous System ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Alpha Cell ', ' α-cell ', ' Glucagon Secreting Cell ', ' Glucagon Cell ', ' metabolomics ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' genome sequencing ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' molecular signature ', ' molecular profile ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' Molecular Target ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' epigenomics ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Familial Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' transcriptomics ', ' Network-based ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new drugs ', ' new drug treatments ', ' loss of function ', ' induced pluripotent stem cell ', ' iPSCs ', ' iPSC ', ' iPS ', ' disease-causing mutation ', ' public health relevance ', ' molecular phenotype ', ' Data Provenance ', ' whole genome ', ' entire genome ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,U54,2017,2167765,CA-45,0.054984560782235244
"Emergence of Functional Network Dynamics from Single Cell Properties Project Summary/Abstract The collective dynamics of the network of neurons in the brain drive its primary holistic function — control of organismal behavior. Pathologies of the nervous system that disrupt this coordinated activity result in dysfunctional patterns of motor output and gross behavior. However, it is unknown how patterns of coordinated activity arise from the properties of single neurons and their connections. In the next five years we seek to develop a rigorous theory and biologically realistic model of the emergence of coordinated dynamics in a complete network of neurons, similar to the current level of understanding of how the dynamics of interacting molecular species produce goal-directed motile behavior in single-cell bacteria. We focus on the relatively simple nervous system of C. elegans; with precisely 302 neurons, it is a natural choice for such fundamental neurodynamical studies. To attack this problem, the research in our lab utilizes a fusion of experimental and computational approaches including advanced microscopy, genomic engineering, machine learning based image processing, quantitative behavior, and dynamical systems analysis. We have developed novel approaches to quantitatively probe and characterize the signal processing properties of single neurons as well as record and quantify the activity of the entire C. elegans nervous system at single-cell resolution using volumetric calcium imaging under genetic perturbation. We are now exploring the relationship between the microscopic properties of cellular signaling and the macroscopic function of collective network dynamics. A mechanistic model of the composition and maintenance of structured, controlled brain dynamics would provide a framework for understanding how gross neurological disease states arise from cellular and molecular dysfunction. Project Narrative A basic theory and data driven model of the emergence of collective, coordinated network dynamics based on the properties of neurons is lacking. Such a theory would provide a framework for understanding how dysfunction at the cellular or molecular level leads to gross neurological disease states.

"Revealing the transcriptomic basis of neuronal identity through functional meta-analysis PROJECT SUMMARY Our overarching goal is to understand how the relationships between genes contribute to functional properties in neurons and how those functions combine to define types of neurons. This is a central question of basic neuroscience, and one which is newly assessable using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). These data provide high-throughput snapshots of gene activities across thousands of cells and thus shed new light on the relationships between genes within and across cells. We propose to exploit this data in conjunction with previously known details about gene function and neuronal identity to learn new features of both. Our research approach is meta-analytic, using data from many different laboratories to obtain a more robust aggregate signal. In addition to developing meta-analytic methods to pursue our direct research interests, the methods are of broad practical relevance to neuroscience laboratories studying many different questions, including diseases of the nervous system. Disseminating our software deliverables in a convenient-to-use form is a central component of each of our research objectives. The three complementary objectives in this project are to: 1. Learn patterns of gene expression which characterize known cell identity. Building on our previous research showing conserved expression patterns across cell-types, we will define shared gene expression patterns, called co-expression, specific to neuronal sub-populations. These shared expression patterns will be used as an assay into cellular identity. 2.Identifynovelcellsubtypesthroughchangesintheexpressionrelationshipsbetweengenes. Variation in co-expression is a form of transcriptional rewiring which often indicates a change in function. To find novel neuronal sub-types we will assess the data for changes in co-expression reflecting a change in functions linked to neuronal identity. We will identify novel transcriptional signatures which replicate across laboratories. 3. Determine consensus methods for customized cell-type learning. Defining wholly unknown expressionprofilesislikelytobenefitfromavarietyofapproaches.Inordertofindagreementbetweenthose approaches, we will develop an algorithm to efficiently search through gene sets likely to find those with complementary value. These gene sets will then be assessed across many pre-existing methods, with customized combinations and aggregate output reported and made available through a public web-server. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent advances in genetics have it made possible to assess gene activity at a cellular level. The primary goal of this project is to develop and validate methods and data resources which combine data from many laboratories to identify how genes interact to produce different functional effects in different types of neurons. Because most gene functions are accomplished in concert with other genes, knowing how genes change their interactions provides key information into how their function might be disrupted in disease.",Revealing the transcriptomic basis of neuronal identity through functional meta-analysis,9398289,R01MH113005,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Communities ', ' Crowding ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Joints ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' Libraries ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Methods ', ' Nervous system structure ', ' Neurologic Organ System ', ' Neurologic Body System ', ' Nervous System ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurons ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Noise ', ' Phenotype ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Work ', ' Custom ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' Genetic ', ' gene function ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Consensus ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' exhaustion ', ' In Situ ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' Ablation ', ' functional group ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Laboratory Study ', ' Reporting ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Property ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Meta-Analyses ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' molecular signature ', ' molecular profile ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Transcript ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' groupings ', ' Grouping ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Output ', ' transcriptional signature ', ' gene expression signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' Expression Signature ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' transcriptomics ', ' candidate marker ', ' candidate biomarker ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' screening ', ' Data Discovery ', ' data resource ', ' ']",NIMH,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,R01,2017,472477,NY-03,0.05699276254394465
"Filtered Point Process Inference Framework for Modeling Neural Data ABSTRACT  Neuronal spike-trains and various other signals in the central nervous system have a discrete, impulsive nature that is well characterized with point process statistical models. In several neuroscience applications, such impulsive signals are transformed upon interaction with biological processes or measurement artifacts, and are consequently observed as filtered point process data. The goal of this project is to develop a principled statistical signal processing framework for filtered point processes with models and algorithms for estimation and inference, and to apply these novel methodologies to experimental data from rodent brain calcium imaging data and human neuroendocrine data. Our approach centers on a unified framework for sparse representation and dynamical systems modeling of marked point process data arising in neuroscience analyses. In addition to its novel statistical methodology, another major strength of our proposal is the application of these methods to experimental data arising in fundamental neuroscience and clinical problems, both to validate the new methods with real data and to investigate basic science questions related to the central nervous system structural and functional organization. Large-scale two-photon calcium imaging, in conjunction with spike-train deconvolution, will allow us to study the activity of over a thousand identified neurons simultaneously with single-spike resolution in a behaving animal. This will allow us to elucidate with high accuracy how the magnitude and spatial structure of signal and noise correlations across neurons vary with stimuli or behavioral tasks. It will shed light on visual encoding in the rodent brain, and neuronal architectures underlying visual perception and cognition, at an unprecedented spatiotemporal scale. Further, our modeling of pulsatile hormone secretion will apply to the release of cortisol, gonadal steroids, insulin, thyroid and growth hormones. Diseases linked to abnormal cortisol secretion include diabetes, visceral obesity and osteoporosis, disturbed memory formation and life-threatening Addisonian crisis. Hence, understanding and modeling the underlying impulsive nature of normal hormone release will aid our understanding of pathological neuroendocrine states and improve the efficacy of drugs and other interventions for treatment of hormonal disorders. Additionally, this project will combine Brown Lab’s computational expertise in point process models with Sur Lab’s experimental expertise in neuronal calcium imaging, extending our ongoing collaboration under the NIH Brain Initiative to developing novel neural population analysis techniques with unprecedented detail at single-neuron, single-spike resolution. Our research is well poised to improve significantly the state of the art and in computational and systems neuroscience tools and bridge together components from the statistical learning, signal processing and computational neuroscience communities to produce a unifying analytical framework for neural data analysis. NARRATIVE  In this project we will develop a filtered point process framework for neural data analysis, with models and algorithms for sparse recovery of spike-trains from time-series data comprising a series of pulsed waveforms. We will use this novel methodology to extract neuronal spike-trains from calcium imaging data of cortical tissue, and to estimate hormone secretion times and amounts from serum hormone levels.

"Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles Anxiety and related disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), are leading causes of global disability. Brain circuit abnormalities have been identified, but important knowledge gaps remain. It is unclear which abnormalities underlie what symptom profiles, how dysfunction develops and thus which brain abnormalities to target with new interventions. Moreover, circuit abnormalities likely cut across traditional diagnostic categories and, within a diagnostic category, there is individual variability. Our approach is to identify reproducible brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms; these brain signatures can then be used to reveal trans-diagnostic disease dimensions, to chart their development, and to develop treatments that target these circuit abnormalities directly.  The goal of this proposal is to identify reproducible brain signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD. To accomplish this, we will study 250 unmedicated OCD and 250 healthy control subjects (HCs) at five expert research sites spanning five countries (U.S., Brazil, India, Netherlands, and South Africa). Using imaging methods that could ultimately be adapted for clinical use, we will examine multiple brain circuits thought to underlie OCD behaviors, focusing on morphometry (using T1- weighted MRI), structural connectivity (using Diffusion Tensor Imaging [DTI]), and functional connectivity (using resting-state fMRI [rs-fMRI]). We will identify neuroimaging signatures that distinguish individuals with OCD from HCs by analyzing each modality with standardized protocols and by using multi-modal fusion with modern machine learning statistical methods. We will then examine how these imaging signatures are linked to behavioral performance on cognitive tasks that probe these same circuits and to a range of clinical profiles that are common to OCD. Finally, we will explore how specific environmental features (childhood trauma, socioeconomic status, religiosity) may moderate this brain-behavior relationship. Our short-term goal is to identify brain signatures of OCD cognitive and clinical profiles, leveraging our global collaboration both to recruit a very large unmedicated sample and to prove these signatures' reproducibility. Our long-term goal is to identify brain signatures for measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms that cut across traditional diagnostic categories and to use these signatures to transform how we conceptualize, diagnose and ultimately treat mental illnesses like OCD. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a prevalent and disabling disorder, and fewer than half of OCD patients become well with current treatments. This study seeks to identify reproducible neuroimaging signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD and that transcend countries/cultures. Identifying brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms will provide robust new treatment targets and help pave the way to precision psychiatry where individual brain signatures can help guide treatment choices.  ",Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles,9316197,R01MH113250,"['Anxiety Disorders ', ' Behavior ', ' behavioral disorder ', ' Behavior Disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Brazil ', ' Cerebellum ', ' cognitive syndrome ', ' cognitive disorder ', ' cognitive disease ', ' Cognition Disorders ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' striatal ', ' Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Collection ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' pallidum ', ' Globus Pallidus ', ' Goals ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hippocampus ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' India ', ' Insula of Reil ', ' Island of Reil ', ' Insula ', ' Central Lobe ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Netherlands ', ' Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder ', ' Obsessive-Compulsive Neurosis ', ' Patients ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' South Africa ', ' Standardization ', ' Stereotyping ', ' Testing ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' thalamic ', ' Thalamus ', ' World Health Organization ', ' Measures ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' base ', ' morphometry ', ' Dorsal ', ' Site ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Age of Onset ', ' Link ', ' disability ', ' Obsession ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Bilateral ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Collaborations ', ' Exposure to ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Knowledge ', ' cognitive function ', ' Dimensions ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Country ', ' Transcend ', ' Inferior ', ' Performance ', ' Obsessive compulsive behavior ', ' obsessive compulsive ', ' Structure ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' Categories ', ' disease classification ', ' nosology ', ' disorder classification ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Modality ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' International Classification of Diseases ', ' International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems ', ' response ', ' illness length ', ' disease length ', ' disease duration ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Meta-Analyses ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' executive function ', ' executive control ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' dMRI ', ' Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Diffusion weighted imaging ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' DWI-MRI ', ' DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) ', ' imaging modality ', ' imaging method ', ' image-based method ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Measurable ', ' Multimodal Imaging ', ' multimodality imaging ', ' multi-modality imaging ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Cognitive ', ' Update ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' childhood trauma ', ' adolescent trauma ', ' pediatric trauma ', ' Prevalence ', ' brain behavior ', ' reward processing ', ' novel diagnostics ', ' next generation diagnostics ', ' new diagnostics ', ' motor control ', ' compulsion ', ' Compulsive Behavior ', ' anxiety-related disorders ', ' Structural defect ', ' structural anomalies ', ' structural abnormalities ', ' Structural malformation ', ' cognitive task ', ' treatment choice ', ' brain abnormalities ', ' ']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2017,749730,NY-13,-0.05241327461271698
"CRCNS: Network mechanisms of the learning and encoding of timed motor responses The brain is an inherently dynamic system, it evolved under strong selective pressures to allow animals to interact with the environment in real-time, and predict and prepare for future events. For these reasons, understanding neural dynamics, and how the brain tells and encodes time is fundamental to understanding brain function. The importance of neural dynamics and timing to brain function emphasizes the need for techniques that allow for the collection and analysis of massively parallel single neuron recordings across multiple structures in behaving animals. This project will combine novel electrophysiological, behavioral, analytical and computational methods to reverse engineer the neural circuits underlying learning and timing. The first aim is to combine large-scale neural recordings with computational approaches to determine how time is represented in the striatum and prefrontal cortex, two interacting brain areas that are closely implicated in temporal processing. We will specifically examine whether encoding of time relies on absolute, relative, or stimulus-specific coding mechanisms. Recordings will be carried out in awake, head-fixed mice trained on a classical trace reward conditioning task in which two cues predict reward with a different delay period. When animals learn the cue-reward association, they engage in robust anticipatory licking that precedes the reward presentation; moreover, the timing of this behavior is dependent on the cue-reward delay time. The second aim is to combine electrophysiology and optogenetics to determine if temporal coding in the striatum and prefrontal cortex is perturbed by transiently disrupting network activity. The hypothesis is that if dynamics of the timing circuits are perturbed then the ensuing activity patterns will be irreversibly altered, thus reducing the accuracy or precision of timed behavioral responses. The third aim is to develop a novel computational framework based on recurrent neural networks models that can predict ""future"" patterns of neural ensemble activity based on ""present"" patterns. The ultimate goal of this work is to integrate highly innovative electrophysiological and computational methods for reverse engineering brain circuit function at the level of networks of hundreds of neurons in the striatum and prefrontal cortex. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Learning to produce appropriately timed actions is fundamental to many aspects of behavior, and disruption of the brain circuits underlying this process is implicated in many neurological and psychiatric disorders.

"Meta-analysis to define neuronal diversity: from genes to functions across species Project Summary To begin unraveling the mysteries of the brain we must first understand its fundamental unit: the neuron. Recent advances in single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology have resulted in the rapid generation of high dimensional data for individual cells, revealing vast heterogeneity and enabling the prediction of novel cell subtypes based on expression patterns. In spite of this wealth of data, a theoretical framework to define subtype identity is lacking. Cross-laboratory expression analysis has emerged as a powerful approach to obtain robust and replicable results and we have previously shown that scRNA-seq data is readily amenable to gene co-expression meta-analysis. Here, we propose that these methods, in combination with cross-species analysis, will provide important validation of novel subtypes, and allow for the identification of new gene functional modules that drive neuronal diversity. Our overall hypothesis is that coordinated gene expression patterns underlie neuronal identity and function. The specific aims to address this hypothesis combine both computational and experimental approaches. First, we will characterize cell-type specific co-expression using RNA-seq data from bulk tissue and from single cells, defining best practices for network construction and identifying and characterizing gene modules that are unique to single cell data. Second, we will define a data- driven cell type taxonomy for the mouse and human nervous systems, and use this to identify neuronal subtype marker genes for validation with co-in situ hybridization and follow up with gene targeting and further scRNA-seq experiments. Finally, we will elucidate functional pathways that are unique to or conserved across species by comparing mouse and human neuronal subtype co-expression networks, with a particular focus on characterizing the cell type specific connectivity of psychiatric disease genes. These aims are consistent with the National Institute of Mental Health's strategic plan to describe the molecules, cells and neural circuits associated with complex behaviors. As a result, these studies will have a significant impact on our understanding of neuronal diversity and identity, leading to improved understanding of the molecular pathology of brain disorders. Project Narrative It has long been known that there are many different kinds of neurons that are involved in controlling brain activity. However, it is unclear precisely how many different types of neurons exist, and to what degree human neurons resemble those of other animals. In this project we propose that by combining information about the gene activity in both human and mouse neurons we will begin to put together a final `parts list' of the nervous system which we can use to understand brain disorders.",Meta-analysis to define neuronal diversity: from genes to functions across species,9395464,F32MH114501,"['Animals ', ' Behavior ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Communities ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Laboratories ', ' Methods ', ' Mus ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Nervous system structure ', ' Neurologic Organ System ', ' Neurologic Body System ', ' Nervous System ', ' Neurons ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Research ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Translations ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Molecular Genetics ', ' General Taxonomy ', ' Taxonomy ', ' in situ Hybridization Staining Method ', ' in situ Hybridization Genetics ', ' In Situ Hybridization ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Gene Targeting ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Complex ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' molecular pathology ', ' Performance ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' neural circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Meta-Analyses ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' computerized data processing ', ' data processing ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Ontology ', ' Validation ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' transcriptional signature ', ' gene expression signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' Expression Signature ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' transcriptomics ', ' comparative ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' high dimensionality ', ' ']",NIMH,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,F32,2017,59166,NY-03,0.040391964600759285
"CRCNS: Computational and neural mechanisms of memory-guided decisions DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): What aspects of previous experiences guide decisions? Much research concerns how the brain computes the average, over many experiences, of rewards received for an option. But such a summary - produced by prominent models of dopaminergic incremental learning- is chiefly useful for repetitive tasks. Much less is understood about how the brain can flexibly evaluate new or changing options in more realistic tasks, which must rely on less aggregated information. This application argues that this is fundamentally a function of memory, so this project looks to the brain's memories for the most individuated experiences - episodes - to seek new computational, cognitive and neural mechanisms that could support more flexible decisions. The overarching hypothesis is that episodic memory, supported by the hippocampus, plays a central role in guiding flexible decision making and complements the wellknown role of dopaminergic and striatal systems in incremental learning of value.     What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity? By connecting the computational neuroscience of decision making with the cognitive neuroscience of memory, and bringing together collaborators from each area, this project promises to shed light on both areas. This is because the neural mechanisms supporting episodic memory are well studied, but less so their contribution to adaptive behavior. Computationally, episodic memories can support a family of learning algorithms that draw on sparse, individual experiences, such as Monte Carlo and kernel methods. These suggest novel, plausible hypotheses for how the brain solves more realistic decision problems, and in particular how it implements ""goal-directed"" or ""model-based"" choices. The proposed studies aim to differentiate the contributions of incremental and episodic learning to value-based decisions, and test to what extent episodic memories contribute to decisions previously identified as model-based. Our hypotheses are tested fitting computational models to neural activity from functional MRI experiments in humans, and also to choice behavior in healthy individuals compared to patients with isolated damage to specific neural systems. This combination of computational, neuroimaging and neuropsychological approaches permits finely tracing the trial-by-trial dynamics of learning as reflected both in brain activity nd behavior, and also testing the causal role of particular brain regions in these same processes.     What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity? A striking range of psychiatric and neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and eating disorders, are accompanied by aberrant decision-making and by dysfunction in circuitry central to this proposal, such as striatal and fronto-temporal mechanisms. But understanding such dysfunction requires a better understanding of how each of these circuits separately influences decisions. A focus on untangling multiple decision systems is particularly pertinent to disorders such as drug abuse, which is hypothesized to center on the compromise of incremental reinforcement mechanisms that may support more habitual actions and underlie the compulsive nature of such diseases. At the same time, drugs may also weaken or compromise more deliberative or goal-directed choice systems that might otherwise be able to support more advantageous decisions. Formally understanding the roles played by both of these influences, and how they interact, promises to improve the conceptualization, diagnosis, and treatment of these and other disorders. The proposed program also provides unique opportunities for training and education. By integrating multiple core tools of systems and cognitive neuroscience (computational modeling, functional imaging, patient studies, behavioral analyses), students in the labs of both PIs are trained in different approaches to a unified research question, preparing them to be effective scientists in a more interdisciplinary future. Components of this training will also be extended to undergraduate and high school student populations through existing programs at both NYU and at Columbia and through outreach to New York area schools. This project will also help promote broader representation of minorities in science, including women. As a female neuroscientist with many women trainees in her laboratory, PI Shohamy serves as a role model and the collaborative project facilitates training for women in computational neuroscience, an area in which women are particularly underrepresented.         Protections for Human Subjects:    Acceptable        Vertebrate Animals:    Not applicable        Resource Sharing:    Acceptable. Data management plan is reasonable. Published data will be shared upon request when practically and ethically possible.        Budget and Period of Support:    Recommend as Requested Drug abuse is acquired through learning. Much research focuses on the involvement of dopaminergic  incremental learning processes. But other learning and memory systems are likely to also contribute to  aspects, such as drug-seeking, not well explained by those mechanisms.

"Hippocampal and prefrontal contributions to memory integration PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Hippocampus (HPC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) structure and connectivity continue to develop through childhood and adolescence, developmental periods that are associated with substantial gains in memory and cognitive ability. While such structural changes are well documented, we know little about the functions that HPC and PFC development confer, fundamentally limiting our understanding of the mechanisms of cognitive development. The overarching goal of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that the representational capacity of the HPC—PFC memory circuit transforms across development from a system that stores individual memories in childhood to a mature system in adulthood wherein cognitive maps represent the relationships among multiple episodes. Cognitive maps allow memory to extend beyond direct experience by coding unobserved relationships among multiple events. In the absence of a mature HPC—PFC system, such knowledge extension through cognitive map formation may be limited in children and adolescents, and therefore result in development differences in learning, decision making, and reasoning behaviors that require consideration of the relationships among multiple events. Moreover, the differential time course of HPC and PFC development, in which mature HPC function may emerge earlier than that of PFC, suggests there may be distinct patterns of memory representation and behavior in adolescence that differ from both childhood and adulthood. To answer these open questions, the proposed studies use a combination of high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and sophisticated multivariate pattern analyses in children (7-9 years), younger adolescents (10-12 years), older adolescents (13-15 years), and adults (25-30 years). Using these methods, we will quantify: (1) age-related differences in HPC—PFC memory integration and separation strategies that support cognitive map formation and (2) how developmental differences in neural representation impact temporal (Aim 1), spatial (Aim 2), and event memory (Aim 3). Collectively, the results from this project will provide a key test of fundamental theories of cognitive development and substantially advance our knowledge of the representational capacities of the HPC—PFC memory system at different ages. In doing so, the findings have the potential to inform interventions designed to enhance memory and reasoning abilities that rely on cognitive maps, including in individuals diagnosed with mental health or neurodevelopmental disorders associated with memory deficits (e.g., autism, depression, Fragile X, or schizophrenia). . PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The proposed research investigates how development of hippocampus and prefrontal cortex the human brain supports memory and reasoning during childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. A growing body of empirical work has shown that difficulties with memory and reasoning in development are associated with poor academic outcomes, as well as with several mental health disorders with developmental onsets, including autism, depression, Fragile X, and schizophrenia. Isolating the neural mechanisms that underlie changes in memory and reasoning ability from childhood to adulthood may thus help identify markers of atypical development and contribute to interventions that may improve both cognitive and academic outcomes.",Hippocampal and prefrontal contributions to memory integration,9616654,R01MH100121,"['Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Autistic Disorder ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' Infantile Autism ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Autism ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Decision Making ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Environment ', ' Fragile X Syndrome ', ' mental retardation-macroorchidism syndrome ', ' marker X syndrome ', ' mar(X) syndrome ', ' macro-orchidism-marker X syndrome ', ' macro-orchidism-marker X (MOMX) syndrome ', ' fragile site mental retardation 1 ', ' fragile Xq syndrome ', ' fragile X-mental retardation syndrome ', ' fra(X)(q27-28) syndrome ', ' fra(X)(q27) syndrome ', ' fra(X)(28) syndrome ', ' fra(X) syndrome ', ' autism-fragile X syndrome ', ' autism-fragile X (AFRAX) syndrome ', ' X-linked mental retardation-fragile site 1 syndrome ', ' X-linked mental retardation with fragile X syndrome ', ' X-linked mental deficiency-megalotestes syndrome ', ' Renpenning syndrome 2 ', ' Martin-Bell-Renpenning syndrome ', ' Martin-Bell Syndrome ', ' Fragile X ', ' Escalante syndrome ', ' Goals ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hippocampus ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Influentials ', ' Learning ', ' Maps ', ' Memory ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' Research ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' improved ', ' Anterior ', ' Medial ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' memory dysfunction ', ' Memory Deficit ', ' Memory impairment ', ' Individual ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Knowledge ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' experience ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' virtual reality ', ' virtual world ', ' virtual environment ', ' VR simulation ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Retrieval ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Neurological Development Disorder ', ' Neurodevelopmental Disorder ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' Outcome ', ' neural mechanism ', ' neuromechanism ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' spatial integration ', ' public health relevance ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' cognitive development ', ' cognitive ability ', ' spatial memory ', ' ']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R01,2018,701530,TX-10,0.028618594214825557
"Reverse Engineering the Brain Stem Circuits that Govern Exploratory Behavior Overview - Abstract  Brainstem function is necessary for life-sustaining functions such as breathing and for survival functions, such as foraging for food. Individual motor actions are activated by specific brainstem cranial motor nuclei. The specificity of individual motor actions reflects the participation of motor nuclei in circuits within closed loops between sensors and muscle actuators. However, these loops are also nested and connect to feedback and feedforward pathways, which underlie coordination between orofacial motor actions. A key question for this proposal is how different actions are coordinated to form a rich repertoire of behaviors, such as rhythmic motions linked to breathing, and the orchestrated displacements of the head, nose, tongue, and vibrissae during exploration. We postulate that the best candidate interface for orofacial motor coordination are premotor and pre2motor neuron populations in the brainstem reticular formation: these neurons project to cranial motor nuclei, receive descending inputs from outside of the brainstem, and interconnected to each other.  Our approach exploits and expands upon a broad spectrum of innovative experimental tools. These include state-of-the-art behavioral methods to study motor actions and their coordination into behaviors. From an experimental perspective, the underlying neuronal circuitry for each orofacial motor action may be accessed via transsynaptic transport starting at the muscle activators or associated sensors in the periphery. These studies will make use of molecular, genetic, and functional labeling methods to enable cell phenotyping and circuit tracing. These data will establish the ""Components"", i.e., brainstem nuclei connectivity for all Research Projects. These studies are complemented by in vivo electrophysiology and optogenetics in order measure and perturb the signal flow during exploration and decision-making: these studies will establish orofacial “Wiring Diagrams”. The sum of these techniques will permit us to elucidate the functions of intrinsic brainstem circuits and their modulation by descending pathways.  Our data will be integrated in two ways. First we will begin development of computational models of the dynamics of active sensing by the orofacial motor plant and brainstem circuits. These will initially focus on the vibrissa system, starting with characterizations of mechanics and mechano-neuronal transformations of vibrissa movement and extending to exploration of brainstem circuits that drive vibrissa set-point and rhythmic whisking. Finally, vibrissa feedforward pathways will be computationally modeled to explore how sensory input affects vibrissa dynamics. Second, to record connectivity data that arises from our experimental tracing studies, we will construct an Trainable Texture-based Digital Atlas that utilizes machine learning to automate anatomical annotation of brainstem nuclei. The Atlas is designed to allow accurate 3D alignment of labeled neurons, even when labeled neurons reside in small sub-regions outside of well-defined brainstem nuclei, based on triangulation to Atlas landmark structures. Further, digitization of serially sectioned brain data sets allows 3D reconstruction and alignment of small brainstem subregions as well as the collation of this data from different brains into the same Atlas.  Our proposed program on brainstem circuitry and dynamics will yield general lessons about the nature of neuronal computation. The analytic and anatomical tools developed for these studies will be made available through our data science core to the larger neuroscience community.

"Software for Automated Reconstruction of Structure & Dynamics of Neural Circuits ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our understanding of brain functions is hindered by the lack of detailed knowledge of synaptic connectivity in the underlying neural network. While synaptic connectivity of small neural circuits can be determined with electron microscopy, studies of connectivity on a larger scale, e.g. whole mouse brain, must be based on light microscopy imaging. It is now possible to fluorescently label subsets of neurons in vivo and image their axonal and dendritic arbors in 3D from multiple brain tissue sections. The overwhelming remaining challenge is neurite tracing, which must be done automatically due to the high-throughput nature of the problem. Currently, there are no automated tools that have the capacity to perform tracing tasks on the scale of mammalian neural circuits. Needless to say, the existence of such a tool is critical both for basic mapping of synaptic connectivity in normal brains, as well as for describing the changes in the nervous system which underlie neurological disorders. With this proposal we plan to continue the development of Neural Circuit Tracer - software for accurate, automated reconstruction of the structure and dynamics of neurites from 3D light microscopy stacks of images. Our goal is to revolutionize the existing functionalities of the software, making it possible to: (i) automatically reconstruct axonal and dendritic arbors of sparsely labeled populations of neurons from multiple stacks of images and (ii) automatically track and quantify changes in the structures of presynaptic boutons and dendritic spines imaged over time. We propose to utilize the latest machine learning and image processing techniques to develop multi-stack tracing, feature detection, and computer-guided trace editing capabilities of the software. All tools and datasets created as part of this proposal will be made available to the research community. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: At present, accurate methods of analysis of neuron morphology and synaptic connectivity rely on manual or semi-automated tracing tools.

"Machine Learning for Generalized Multiscale Modeling Project Summary/Abstract  This project develops machine learning approaches that describe statistical systems in biology. By combining analytic results calculated from the exact probabilistic description of the system with machine learning inference, our new methods present exciting opportunities to model previously inaccessible complex dynamics. The resulting Boltzmann machine-like learning algorithms present a new class of modeling techniques based on the powerful in- ference of arti cial neural networks. Further development of this approach will bring the groundbreaking advances from the surge of recent interest in machine learning into the biological modeling eld. The mathematical methods we develop will be used to derive e cient algorithms for multiscale simulation, directly applicable to large scale biological modeling. In particular, the algorithms will be used to study the dynamics of stochastic biochemistry at synapses, with direct relevance to learning and memory formation in the brain. Current studies of these processes are limited by the long timescales involved and the highly spatially organized structures featured. In addition to leveraging the machine learning expertise we are developing, we also employ new electron microscopy datasets to produce 3D reconstructions of neural tissue with unprecedented accuracy. Consequentially, we will be able to study the fundamental mechanisms underlying synaptic plasticity, as well as the biochemical basis of oscillatory behavior in networks of neurons that occurs during sleep. Furthermore, the interactions of these highly stochastic ion channels with electrical in neurons will be explored through groundbreaking hybrid simulation environments. The software that we will develop combines existing popular simulation tools into multiscale approaches, and will be distributed as a powerful tool to the broader biological modeling community. Its usage in further computational experiments can present a key advancement in the development of pharmaceuticals, allowing the direct study of the interactions of biochemistry and whole neuron electrophysiology without making limiting assumptions to sim- plify the simulations. This has promising implications for intervening in age-related learning de cits, as well as in neurological disorders such as Alzheimers. Finally, this proposal will bring together our existing multiscale modeling community, the National Center for Multi-scale Modeling of Biological Systems (MMBioS), with the MSM consortium. The interactions of these organizations and their communities of expert researchers will foster new collaborative work on exciting multiscale problems in biology, including applications of the machine learning frameworks and software we are developing. 1 Project Narrative  A wide variety of biological systems can be described statistically, from molecular biochemistry up to the network level activity of neurons.

"Filtered Point Process Inference Framework for Modeling Neural Data ABSTRACT  Neuronal spike-trains and various other signals in the central nervous system have a discrete, impulsive nature that is well characterized with point process statistical models. In several neuroscience applications, such impulsive signals are transformed upon interaction with biological processes or measurement artifacts, and are consequently observed as filtered point process data. The goal of this project is to develop a principled statistical signal processing framework for filtered point processes with models and algorithms for estimation and inference, and to apply these novel methodologies to experimental data from rodent brain calcium imaging data and human neuroendocrine data. Our approach centers on a unified framework for sparse representation and dynamical systems modeling of marked point process data arising in neuroscience analyses. In addition to its novel statistical methodology, another major strength of our proposal is the application of these methods to experimental data arising in fundamental neuroscience and clinical problems, both to validate the new methods with real data and to investigate basic science questions related to the central nervous system structural and functional organization. Large-scale two-photon calcium imaging, in conjunction with spike-train deconvolution, will allow us to study the activity of over a thousand identified neurons simultaneously with single-spike resolution in a behaving animal. This will allow us to elucidate with high accuracy how the magnitude and spatial structure of signal and noise correlations across neurons vary with stimuli or behavioral tasks. It will shed light on visual encoding in the rodent brain, and neuronal architectures underlying visual perception and cognition, at an unprecedented spatiotemporal scale. Further, our modeling of pulsatile hormone secretion will apply to the release of cortisol, gonadal steroids, insulin, thyroid and growth hormones. Diseases linked to abnormal cortisol secretion include diabetes, visceral obesity and osteoporosis, disturbed memory formation and life-threatening Addisonian crisis. Hence, understanding and modeling the underlying impulsive nature of normal hormone release will aid our understanding of pathological neuroendocrine states and improve the efficacy of drugs and other interventions for treatment of hormonal disorders. Additionally, this project will combine Brown Lab’s computational expertise in point process models with Sur Lab’s experimental expertise in neuronal calcium imaging, extending our ongoing collaboration under the NIH Brain Initiative to developing novel neural population analysis techniques with unprecedented detail at single-neuron, single-spike resolution. Our research is well poised to improve significantly the state of the art and in computational and systems neuroscience tools and bridge together components from the statistical learning, signal processing and computational neuroscience communities to produce a unifying analytical framework for neural data analysis. NARRATIVE  In this project we will develop a filtered point process framework for neural data analysis, with models and algorithms for sparse recovery of spike-trains from time-series data comprising a series of pulsed waveforms. We will use this novel methodology to extract neuronal spike-trains from calcium imaging data of cortical tissue, and to estimate hormone secretion times and amounts from serum hormone levels. We will make our mathematical algorithms for neural data analysis and their software implementation freely and easily available to the neuroscience research community.",Filtered Point Process

"Transcriptome-based systematic discovery of GABAergic neurons in the neocortex ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The integrated sensory, motor, and cognitive abilities that guide adaptive behavior in mammals emerge from neural circuit operations in the neocortex. Understanding the organization of cortical circuits requires comprehensive knowledge of the basic cellular components. The neocortex consists of approximately 80% glutamatergic pyramidal neurons and 20% GABAergic neurons. Although a minority, GABA interneurons are exceptionally diverse, and this diversity may be crucial in regulating the balance and functional operations of cortical circuits. However, systematic identification, enumeration and classification of GABAergic neurons have been a challenging goal. We hypothesize that distinct transcription programs underlie GABA prototype identity and diversity as defined by their position, morphology and basic innervation pattern. Thus we suggest that transcription profiling provides a fundamental starting point and efficient strategy for cell type discovery. Here we propose a multi-faceted approach that integrates genetic targeting, single cell transcriptomics, statistical and computational analysis, morpho-physiological studies to systematically identify and classify GABAergic neurons. We focus on GABA neurons derived from the embryonic medial ganglionic eminence (MGE), which constitute two-third of cortical interneurons, and for which we have built effective genetic tools. We have established a robust single cell RNAseq (scRNAseq) method that allows high resolution transcriptome profiling through single mRNA counting using nucleotide barcodes. We will take a two-step ""Targeted-Saturation"" cell screen approach toward systematic discovery of cortical GABA neurons. First, we will apply scRNAseq to a set of GABA subpopulations, captured by intersectional genetic targeting, and discover their distinct transcription signatures. With these phenotype- characterized populations, we hone our statistical analysis to distinguish biological signal vs experimental noise and artifacts, and shape our computation algorithm based on biological ground truth. Thus in contrast to a unsupervised clustering approach to transcriptome analysis, we incorporate extensive empirical information that enable a biology-motivated supervised approach, where well-delineated phenotypes play the key role of training the algorithm and classifier. Second, we will apply scRNASeq to increasingly broader genetic-defined populations of MGE-derived GABA neurons in the primary motor cortex. We will discover transcriptome-predicted cell types and build 2nd round driver lines that target and validate a subset of novel cell types. Our study will build a comprehensive catalog of a major cohort of cortical GABAergic neurons by integrating transcription profiles and basic cell phenotypes. This will establish a cellular foundation for studying inhibitory circuit organization, function, and dysfunction. 1 PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will combine genetic engineering, single cell gene expression profiling, computational analysis, anatomical and physiological approaches to systematically discover GABAergic cell types in the mouse neocortex.

"Emergence of Functional Network Dynamics from Single Cell Properties Project Summary/Abstract The collective dynamics of the network of neurons in the brain drive its primary holistic function — control of organismal behavior. Pathologies of the nervous system that disrupt this coordinated activity result in dysfunctional patterns of motor output and gross behavior. However, it is unknown how patterns of coordinated activity arise from the properties of single neurons and their connections. In the next five years we seek to develop a rigorous theory and biologically realistic model of the emergence of coordinated dynamics in a complete network of neurons, similar to the current level of understanding of how the dynamics of interacting molecular species produce goal-directed motile behavior in single-cell bacteria. We focus on the relatively simple nervous system of C. elegans; with precisely 302 neurons, it is a natural choice for such fundamental neurodynamical studies. To attack this problem, the research in our lab utilizes a fusion of experimental and computational approaches including advanced microscopy, genomic engineering, machine learning based image processing, quantitative behavior, and dynamical systems analysis. We have developed novel approaches to quantitatively probe and characterize the signal processing properties of single neurons as well as record and quantify the activity of the entire C. elegans nervous system at single-cell resolution using volumetric calcium imaging under genetic perturbation. We are now exploring the relationship between the microscopic properties of cellular signaling and the macroscopic function of collective network dynamics. A mechanistic model of the composition and maintenance of structured, controlled brain dynamics would provide a framework for understanding how gross neurological disease states arise from cellular and molecular dysfunction. Project Narrative A basic theory and data driven model of the emergence of collective, coordinated network dynamics based on the properties of neurons is lacking.

"A Novel Strategy for Combating Obesity: Reprogramming Neural Circuits Obesity and Type 2 diabetes have skyrocketed to epidemic proportions in American children and adults. To prevent the onset, initiate the reversal, and avoid the relapse of obesity, we must first identify the neural underpinnings of unhealthy eating choices and habits. The immediate goals of this innovative proposal are to decipher the neural code predicting compulsive overconsumption of sugar and to develop new approaches, algorithms, and technologies to detect neural signals of craving in real-time to avert maladaptive behaviors with unprecedented precision. Specifically, the project outline will begin by identifying neural circuits mediating compulsive sucrose seeking. Next, we will record neural activity using in vivo electrophysiology and fluorescence microendoscopy of GCaMP5-expressing cells to collect precise, first-order, raw features with high signal-to-noise ratio during cue-induced reinstatement and compulsion behavioral assays with their time-locked neural correlates allows for the identification of craving states. Then, we will use machine learning algorithms such as support vector machine classification of neural activity allows for a Bayesian hidden Markov model for a transition diagram between states in craving-compulsion-consumption behavioral chains. Following identification of neural activity signaling “craving” states (operationally defined as the behavioral state immediately preceding compulsive reward-seeking), real-time state detection will be used to trigger precise optogenetic inhibition of compulsive sucrose-seeking. A successful outcome of this research would establish a new paradigm for the treatment for obesity, focusing on reprogramming the neural circuit perturbations that cause obesity, as opposed to treating the physical consequences of a neural circuit imbalance – an approach that could also be applied to other neuropsychiatric disorders including addiction, anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). This proposal is ideally suited for the New Innovator Award for the following reasons: First, the ultimate goal of this research is to lay the foundation for translating Neural Circuit Reprogramming to human patients. Second, the proposal is focused on technology development, delivering new technologies that will enable not state-identification and dynamic triggering used for Neural Circuit Reprogramming, and serve as springboards for other fields. Third, this proposal heavily leverages my unique background in sucrose-self administration, relapse, optogenetics, electrophysiology and imaging, but is technically and conceptually distinct from my lab’s other studies on acute perturbations that affect anxiety, depression and addiction. As a new faculty member at MIT, I am poised at the nexus of science, engineering, computation and technology and am equipped with the precise skill set and expertise to execute this high-risk, yet potentially revolutionary project. Obesity afflicts ~35% of Americans, representing one of the greatest threats to the health of our nation, for both children and adults. With obesity, Type 2 diabetes, and other associated health problems skyrocketing, it is imperative that we focus on addressing the source of the problem rather than just treating the symptoms. To prevent the onset, initiate the reversal, and avoid the relapse of obesity, we must first identify the neural underpinnings of unhealthy eating choices and habits.",A Novel Strategy for Combating Obesity: Reprogramming Neural Circuits,9605805,DP2DK102256,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anxiety ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Cues ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type two diabetes ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Engineering ', ' Epidemic ', ' Faculty ', ' Fluorescence ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Habits ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Noise ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder ', ' Obsessive-Compulsive Neurosis ', ' Patients ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Rewards ', ' Science ', ' Self Administration ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Sucrose ', ' Saccharose ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Mediating ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' Acute ', ' Nexus Junction ', ' Nexus ', ' Low-resistance Junction ', ' Communicating Junction ', ' Gap Junctions ', ' sugar ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Source ', ' American ', ' technology development ', ' tech development ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' skills ', ' neurotransmission ', ' neuronal signaling ', ' neural signaling ', ' nerve signaling ', ' glial signaling ', ' glia signaling ', ' axonal signaling ', ' axon-glial signaling ', ' axon signaling ', ' Neuronal Transmission ', ' Nerve Transmission ', ' Nerve Impulse Transmission ', ' member ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' neural circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' craving ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Detection ', ' in vivo ', ' Behavioral ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' obesity treatment ', ' Behavioral Assay ', ' markov model ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Consumption ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' addictive disorder ', ' addiction ', ' high risk ', ' combat ', ' optogenetics ', ' compulsion ', ' neural correlate ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' treat symptom ', ' symptomatic treatment ', ' symptom treatment ', ' endomicroscopy ', ' microendoscopy ', ' ']",NIDDK,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,DP2,2018,433667,MA-07,-0.16351082370284598
"CRCNS: Network mechanisms of the learning and encoding of timed motor responses The brain is an inherently dynamic system, it evolved under strong selective pressures to allow animals to interact with the environment in real-time, and predict and prepare for future events. For these reasons, understanding neural dynamics, and how the brain tells and encodes time is fundamental to understanding brain function. The importance of neural dynamics and timing to brain function emphasizes the need for techniques that allow for the collection and analysis of massively parallel single neuron recordings across multiple structures in behaving animals. This project will combine novel electrophysiological, behavioral, analytical and computational methods to reverse engineer the neural circuits underlying learning and timing. The first aim is to combine large-scale neural recordings with computational approaches to determine how time is represented in the striatum and prefrontal cortex, two interacting brain areas that are closely implicated in temporal processing. We will specifically examine whether encoding of time relies on absolute, relative, or stimulus-specific coding mechanisms. Recordings will be carried out in awake, head-fixed mice trained on a classical trace reward conditioning task in which two cues predict reward with a different delay period. When animals learn the cue-reward association, they engage in robust anticipatory licking that precedes the reward presentation; moreover, the timing of this behavior is dependent on the cue-reward delay time. The second aim is to combine electrophysiology and optogenetics to determine if temporal coding in the striatum and prefrontal cortex is perturbed by transiently disrupting network activity. The hypothesis is that if dynamics of the timing circuits are perturbed then the ensuing activity patterns will be irreversibly altered, thus reducing the accuracy or precision of timed behavioral responses. The third aim is to develop a novel computational framework based on recurrent neural networks models that can predict ""future"" patterns of neural ensemble activity based on ""present"" patterns. The ultimate goal of this work is to integrate highly innovative electrophysiological and computational methods for reverse engineering brain circuit function at the level of networks of hundreds of neurons in the striatum and prefrontal cortex. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Learning to produce appropriately timed actions is fundamental to many aspects of behavior, and disruption of the brain circuits underlying this process is implicated in many neurological and psychiatric disorders. This project will develop an integrated approach to studying the mechanisms of timed motor behavior by combining large-scale neural recordings from multiple brain areas and computational modeling of neural networks.

"Deciphering the building blocks of hippocampal circuits   Abstract   Since  Ramon  y  Cajal,  neuroscientists  have  speculated  that  even  the  most  complex  brain  functions  might  eventually be understood at the level of neuronal cell types and their connections. Unfortunately, our under‐ standing of the brain's extensive diversity of cell types and elaborate circuitry remains far from complete. For  example, despite the hippocampus being essential for learning and memory and its dysfunction underlying a  wide variety of devastating neuropsychiatric disorders, we still lack fundamental knowledge about its constit‐ uent cell types and their molecular profiles and connectivity, slowing progress towards a mechanistic circuit‐ level understanding of memory formation. We propose to identify all of the interneuron cell types in area CA1  of the hippocampus and decipher their canonical connectivity. We have assembled a strong interdisciplinary  team  capable  of  combining  cutting‐edge  technologies  including  high‐throughput  multi‐cell  patch  recordings,  morphological reconstructions, single‐cell RNA sequencing, and machine learning to achieve two main goals:  1) dissect CA1 microcircuit organization by generating a morphological and electrophysiological taxonomy of  all interneuron cell types in mouse CA1 and map their connections; and 2) derive transcriptomic signatures of  morphologically defined CA1 interneurons using our newly developed Patch‐seq method. Our team recently  implemented  this  interdisciplinary  experimental  strategy  to  successfully  identify  cell  types  in  the  neocortex  and dissect their microcircuitry. Using multi‐cell patch clamp recording, we will characterize the electrophysi‐ ological properties, morphology, laminar location and connectivity of thousands of neurons from mouse CA1  hippocampus. We will also utilize a new, highly sensitive, cost effective technique for single‐cell RNA sequenc‐ ing (Smart‐seq2) to map their transcriptomes and machine learning techniques to classify cells into molecular  types.  Importantly,  our  high‐throughput  method  will  allow  us  to  obtain  morphological,  electrophysiological  and  complete  transcriptome  information  for  single  neurons,  which  cannot  be  achieved  using  other  methods  such as dissociating tissue for single‐cell sequencing. In‐house customization and automation has reduced our  sequencing costs, enabling us to sequence thousands of cells within a reasonable budget. Cell type identifica‐ tion will be validated using morphological, electrophysiological, and molecular tests. Identifying all of the in‐ terneuron  cell  types  that  comprise  CA1  and  determining  how  they  connect  to  each  other  will  have  a  broad,  paradigm‐shifting impact. For instance, it will contribute to a circuit‐level understanding of the computations  that take place in CA1, such as memory formation. From a clinical perspective, single‐cell transcriptome data  will yield a powerful atlas to investigate relationships between cell types and genes related to neuropsychiatric  diseases and facilitate cell‐type engineering.       Narrative  The  hippocampus  is  a  complex  brain  structure  that  mediates  remarkable  mental  functions  like  learning  and  memory, while its malfunction is associated with devastating neuropsychiatric diseases including Alzheimer's

"Neural mechanisms for reducing interference during episodic memory formation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One of the biggest challenges to successful remembering is the potential for confusion or interference between similar memories. For every password, name, or parking space that we store in memory, there are many other passwords, names or parking spaces that we have already learned or will learn in the future. While interference is a factor in relatively benign-yet annoying-examples of 'normal' forgetting, it is aso a major factor in clinically significant examples of forgetting that occur with aging and/or dementia. Thus, there is a fundamental need to understand the neural mechanisms that support the acquisition/retrieval of similar memories while minimizing interference and corresponding forgetting. Computational models of episodic memory have proposed two core mechanisms that are thought to reduce interference-related forgetting: integration and pattern separation. Integration involves 'fusing' overlapping memories into a common representation such that the relationship between these memories is more complementary than competitive. Pattern separation involves the orthogonalization of similar memories such that differences between memories are exaggerated and the potential for interference minimized. While there is general agreement that these mechanisms are theoretically appealing and offer clear computational advantages, clear evidence for how and when these learning mechanisms are invoked- particularly in humans-remains surprisingly limited. In particular, there remains ambiguity as far as (a) the learning contexts in which each mechanism might be recruited, (b) what the corresponding neural signatures of each mechanism are, and (c) the specific behavioral consequences associated with the engagement of each mechanism. We propose a systematic investigation of the contexts in which integration and pattern separation occur with the goal of using sophisticated, cutting-edge neuroimaging (fMRI) techniques to identify distributed patterns of neural activity that are diagnostic of each mechanism. Critically, we also plan to use these observed patterns of neural activity-that is, neural evidence for integration vs. separation-to predict behavioral memory phenomena, including interference-related forgetting. The research represents a strong synthesis of psychology and neuroscience questions with an emphasis on learning mechanisms inspired by computational models and analysis approaches that draw from the fields of machine learning and data mining. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A primary reason we forget is because we store a vast number of memories and interference between these memories becomes inevitable. While forgetting may represent only an occasional annoyance for most people, among older adults and those with dementia-groups that are growing at a disproportionate rate memory confusions and susceptibility to interference-related forgetting can be debilitating problems. The proposed research seeks to identify neural mechanisms that reduce interference-related forgetting and will develop neurodiagnostic tools that can be used to characterize memory processes and predict susceptibility to memory confusions and forgetting.",Neural mechanisms for reducing interference during episodic memory formation,9533702,R01NS089729,"['Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' Animals ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Confusion ', ' Mental Confusion ', ' Confusional State ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hippocampus ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Learning ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Names ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Psychology ', ' Research ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Rodentia ', ' Testing ', ' base ', ' computational neuroscience ', ' Benign ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' Episodic memory ', ' experience ', ' behavior measurement ', ' behavioral measurement ', ' behavioral measure ', ' forgetting ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' memory process ', ' memory processing ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' Agreement ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' data mining ', ' datamining ', ' Address ', ' Retrieval ', ' Cognitive ', ' computer analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computational analyses ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' Behavioral ', ' neural mechanism ', ' neuromechanism ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinically significant ', ' memory encoding ', ' public health relevance ', ' neural patterning ', ' behavior study ', ' behavioral study ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R01,2018,278688,OR-04,0.04650537505108227
"The behavioral functions of upper and lower cortical layers PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The cerebral cortex mediates all of human and animal cognition, encompassing a diverse set of abilities including sensation, perception, decision making, and motor planning. Dysfunctions of the cerebral cortex are thought to underlie numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders. A major obstacle both to understanding normal behaving and to treating pathology is the high degree of complexity of cortical circuitry, which has remained largely enigmatic. The conventional view of neocortex has been that sensory processing begins in layer 4 (L4), which was identified a century ago as the principal target of thalamic axons carrying information from our sensory organs. Sensory transforms are widely believed to occur as excitation spreads serially along the densest axonal pathways (thalamus→L4→L2/3→L5/6). Recently we discovered that the cerebral cortex, rather than being a monolithic structure, may contain two entirely separate processing systems, activated by the same signals arising from the thalamus. L4 is thus not an obligatory distribution hub for cortical activity, and thalamus activates two distinct “strata” of cortex in parallel.  This proposal's goal is to identify the behavioral and computational roles of the upper (L2-4) and lower strata (L5/6) as well as the interactions between them. We will investigate the behavioral roles of these layers in the mouse whisker system. Specific layers will be optogenetically disrupted in a series of tactile behavioral tasks, in which task complexity is progressively increased. Interlaminar interactions will also be studied by recording electrophysiologically from specific layers during behavior and using novel machine learning techniques designed to identify the type of computation performed in different levels of “deep networks”. The dimensionality of the representation in a layer will be estimated under normal behaviors and when specific layers are inactivated.  Identifying fundamental functions of upper versus cortical layers will likely pave the way for future studies in other neocortical systems and in higher-order species. Moreover, as the different layers contain molecularly and biophysically distinct cell types and project to distinct downstream targets, specific neurological disorders may involve dysfunction of specific pathways, cell types, and layers. Establishing the behavioral and computational roles of these elements may contribute to development of targeted therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Dysfunctions of the cerebral cortex are thought to underlie numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders, but the behavioral and functional roles of cortical layers and cell types are unknown. Identifying the contributions of specific cortical layers to normal circuit function will lead to better treatment of pathological conditions.     ",The behavioral functions of upper and lower cortical layers,9483798,R01NS094659,"['Animals ', ' Axon ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Biophysics ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cerebral cortex ', ' Cognition ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' striatal ', ' Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Decision Making ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Elements ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Mus ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurons ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Pathology ', ' Perception ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Esthesia ', ' Sensation ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Spinal Cord ', ' Medulla Spinalis ', ' Synapses ', ' synapse ', ' Synaptic ', ' Task Performances ', ' Testing ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' thalamic ', ' Thalamus ', ' Vibrissae ', ' Whiskers ', ' Halorhodopsins ', ' Halorhodopsin Chromoprotein ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' neopallium ', ' isocortex ', ' homotypical cortex ', ' Neocortex ', ' Organ ', ' Area ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Morphology ', ' Shapes ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Dimensions ', ' Tactile ', ' Auditory ', ' Complex ', ' Sensory ', ' Source ', ' cell type ', ' Texture ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Performance ', ' sensory discrimination ', ' Structure ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' Modality ', ' response ', ' object shape ', ' Detection ', ' Motor ', ' Sensory Physiology ', ' Pathologic ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Output ', ' Pyramidal neuron ', ' hippocampal pyramidal neuron ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' neocortical ', ' spatial integration ', ' optogenetics ', ' biophysical parameters ', ' biophysical measurement ', ' biophysical characterization ', ' biophysical characteristics ', ' biophysical properties ', ' targeted therapy ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted treatment ', ' ']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2018,350000,NY-13,0.016104323019090785
"""Methods from Computational Topology and Geometry for Analysing Neuronal Tree and Graph Data"" Summary Progress from description to quantification is essential as a science matures. Yet numerical analysis of the elementary unit of brain circuitry—the individual neuron—continues to pose methodological challenges. Even the definition of a measurement yardstick (a metric) for the tree shape of a neuron remains an open research problem. Without such metrics, researchers cannot accurately classify neurons into cell types, an essential step toward understanding the circuit components and how they work together. Advanced methods from computational topology and geometry, which have only recently made their way from pure mathematics into data analysis, will be used to extract, characterize, and classify neuronal shapes in a way that elegantly incorporates the underlying dynamical electrophysiological properties. The first specific aim will apply new mathematical methods to define and compute metrics on the shapes of a wide variety of neurons. A computational topological analysis called “persistence summaries” will be used to generate invariant representations of the neurons that can then be compared using different norms. An important strength of this method is that it works flexibly with arbitrary functions defined on the neurons, including purely structural ones (such as distance from the soma) or functions with electrophysiological meaning (such as electrotonic distance or propagation delays) and can therefore incorporate dynamics. A more advanced approach based on the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between metric spaces will be also explored. The metrics so generated will be used for classification and clustering, visualization of the space of neuronal shapes, and shape-based database search for neuronal reconstructions derived from light or electron microscopy. The second aim will use Morse theory to reconstruct individual neurons from light microscopic data, or skeletonize tracer injection data to summarize the structure of projection patterns. This approach retains shape information, which is lost when such data are characterized in a connectivity matrix. Further, these methods will be applied to construct consensus trees, which can be used as a summary of different reconstructions produced by different algorithms. The tools will be freely shared under a suitable open-source software license, and made available via plugins to widely used software platforms as well as web services to a community repository of neuronal morphologies. The team of researchers includes theorists, experimentalists, data scientists, and end users, all with extensive relevant experience. Apart from enabling the understanding of normal brain circuitry in terms of its component neurons, the proposed methods will also allow researchers to characterize changes in the shape of neurons in pathologically altered circuits, with applications to transgenic animal models of disease.

"Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles Anxiety and related disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), are leading causes of global disability. Brain circuit abnormalities have been identified, but important knowledge gaps remain. It is unclear which abnormalities underlie what symptom profiles, how dysfunction develops and thus which brain abnormalities to target with new interventions. Moreover, circuit abnormalities likely cut across traditional diagnostic categories and, within a diagnostic category, there is individual variability. Our approach is to identify reproducible brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms; these brain signatures can then be used to reveal trans-diagnostic disease dimensions, to chart their development, and to develop treatments that target these circuit abnormalities directly.  The goal of this proposal is to identify reproducible brain signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD. To accomplish this, we will study 250 unmedicated OCD and 250 healthy control subjects (HCs) at five expert research sites spanning five countries (U.S., Brazil, India, Netherlands, and South Africa). Using imaging methods that could ultimately be adapted for clinical use, we will examine multiple brain circuits thought to underlie OCD behaviors, focusing on morphometry (using T1- weighted MRI), structural connectivity (using Diffusion Tensor Imaging [DTI]), and functional connectivity (using resting-state fMRI [rs-fMRI]). We will identify neuroimaging signatures that distinguish individuals with OCD from HCs by analyzing each modality with standardized protocols and by using multi-modal fusion with modern machine learning statistical methods. We will then examine how these imaging signatures are linked to behavioral performance on cognitive tasks that probe these same circuits and to a range of clinical profiles that are common to OCD. Finally, we will explore how specific environmental features (childhood trauma, socioeconomic status, religiosity) may moderate this brain-behavior relationship. Our short-term goal is to identify brain signatures of OCD cognitive and clinical profiles, leveraging our global collaboration both to recruit a very large unmedicated sample and to prove these signatures' reproducibility. Our long-term goal is to identify brain signatures for measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms that cut across traditional diagnostic categories and to use these signatures to transform how we conceptualize, diagnose and ultimately treat mental illnesses like OCD. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a prevalent and disabling disorder, and fewer than half of OCD patients become well with current treatments. This study seeks to identify reproducible neuroimaging signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD and that transcend countries/cultures. Identifying brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms will provide robust new treatment targets and help pave the way to precision psychiatry where individual brain signatures can help guide treatment choices.  ",Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles,9534190,R01MH113250,"['Anxiety Disorders ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Disorders ', ' behavioral disorder ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brazil ', ' Cerebellum ', ' Cognition Disorders ', ' cognitive syndrome ', ' cognitive disorder ', ' cognitive disease ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' striatal ', ' Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Collection ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Globus Pallidus ', ' pallidum ', ' Goals ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hippocampus ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' India ', ' Insula of Reil ', ' Island of Reil ', ' Insula ', ' Central Lobe ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Netherlands ', ' Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder ', ' Obsessive-Compulsive Neurosis ', ' Patients ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' South Africa ', ' Standardization ', ' Stereotyping ', ' Testing ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' thalamic ', ' Thalamus ', ' World Health Organization ', ' Measures ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' base ', ' morphometry ', ' Dorsal ', ' Site ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Age of Onset ', ' Link ', ' disability ', ' Obsession ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Bilateral ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Collaborations ', ' Exposure to ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Knowledge ', ' cognitive function ', ' Dimensions ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Country ', ' Transcend ', ' Inferior ', ' Performance ', ' Obsessive compulsive behavior ', ' obsessive compulsive ', ' Structure ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' Categories ', ' disease classification ', ' nosology ', ' disorder classification ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Modality ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' International Classification of Diseases ', ' International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems ', ' response ', ' illness length ', ' disease length ', ' disease duration ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Meta-Analyses ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' executive function ', ' executive control ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' dMRI ', ' Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Diffusion weighted imaging ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' DWI-MRI ', ' DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) ', ' imaging modality ', ' imaging method ', ' image-based method ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Measurable ', ' Multimodal Imaging ', ' multimodality imaging ', ' multi-modality imaging ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Cognitive ', ' Update ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' childhood trauma ', ' adolescent trauma ', ' pediatric trauma ', ' Prevalence ', ' brain behavior ', ' reward processing ', ' next generation diagnostics ', ' new diagnostics ', ' novel diagnostics ', ' motor control ', ' compulsion ', ' anxiety-related disorders ', ' structural anomalies ', ' structural abnormalities ', ' Structural malformation ', ' Structural defect ', ' cognitive task ', ' treatment choice ', ' brain abnormalities ', ' recruit ', ' individual variability ', ' individual heterogeneity ', ' individual variation ', ' ']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2018,668364,NY-13,-0.05241327461271698
"CRCNS:  Neural coding and computation in large ensembles in prefrontal cortex ﻿PROJECT SUMMARY The essence of cognition is choice, and to understand choice we need to understand the brain mechanisms that guide decisions in complex settings. These mechanisms are implemented through interactions of large neural networks across cortical and subcortical areas. Tracking population response dynamics on single trials and relating them to internal cognitive states and overt behavior are critical for incisive tests of current models of decision-making. Here we propose to characterize the activity patterns of large populations of neurons (100+) in the prefrontal cortex of macaque monkeys engaged in decision-making tasks. We will explain the spatiotemporal patterns of activation in the population by developing the most parsimonious probabilistic model that takes into account pairwise and higher-order interactions of neurons. The model will be utilized to characterize response manifolds of the network and quantify its dynamics in different task epochs. Our approach is unique because rather than trying to embed the population dynamics in a low dimensional manifold using Machine Learning tools, we propose to extend the Maximum Entropy framework to directly capture the high-dimensional dynamics. Further, by characterizing functional dependencies among cells we can map the architecture and design of large networks in terms of subnetwork motifs and computations. Finally, we will investigate how noisy fluctuations of responses or artificial manipulation of network activity influences its dynamics and modifies or disturbs its computations. Scrutinizing the results of these experiments within our modeling framework makes headway toward addressing long-standing questions about decision-making, including the neural basis of psychological models and effects of initial state on the behavior.  Our work will have broader impacts in two domains. First, the path that we will chart for discovering functional subnetworks and their computations will be useable in various subfields of neuroscience. We will significantly advance data analysis and computational modeling tools available to neuroscientists and, therefore, will facilitate future studies of normal mental functions and mental disorders using high-dimensional neural data. Second, characterizing information encoding and response dynamics in the prefrontal cortex sheds light on mechanisms of decision-making and emergence of cognitive abilities in complex neural networks. Deficits of decision-making are at the heart of a number of neurological and psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's disease. Several behavioral and pharmacological therapies have been proposed for those deficits, but we lack a clear understanding of how they work at the level of neuronal systems. To develop the next generation of therapies, we need to understand how cognitive processes emerge across multiple functional levels, from individual neurons to networks of brain areas. Our work is a step in that direction. It has the potential to advance our understanding of pathology of mental disorders and help with the discovery of better treatments. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this proposal is to develop a computational framework that accurately captures response dynamics of a population of prefrontal neurons during decision-making. We will simultaneously measure and manipulate the activity of one hundred or more prefrontal neurons and develop computational models that explain the response dynamics of the prefrontal network. Our study will facilitate a better understanding of the decision-making process, which is impaired in a number of neurological and psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's disease.",CRCNS:  Neural coding and computation in large ensembles in prefrontal cortex,9487337,R01MH109180,"[""Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cognition ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Decision Making ', ' Electrodes ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Heart ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Literature ', ' Macaca ', ' Macaque ', ' Maps ', ' Psychological Models ', ' Psychologic Models ', ' Statistical Models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Monkeys ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurons ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Noise ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Parkinsons disease ', "" Parkinson's disease "", "" Parkinson's "", ' Parkinson ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Pathology ', ' Population Dynamics ', ' Primates ', ' Primates Mammals ', ' Retina ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Testing ', ' Vocabulary ', ' Vocabulary Words ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Experimental Models ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' insight ', ' Intuition ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Entropy ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' association cortex ', ' sensory cortex ', ' Biological Neural Networks ', ' neural network ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Structure ', ' Graph ', ' Reporting ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' neural circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' behavioral pharmacology ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' computational framework ', ' computer framework ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' next generation ', ' Population ', ' neural mechanism ', ' neuromechanism ', ' Impairment ', ' Network-based ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' cognitive process ', ' cognitive ability ', ' behavior outcome ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' mental function ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' high dimensionality ', ' ']",NIMH,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,236692,NY-12,0.03866728215747492
"CRCNS: Common algorithmic strategies used by the brain for labeling points in high-dimensional space The first major goal of this work is to learn how certain brain regions (olfactory system,  hippocampus, and cerebellum) learn very complex stimuli that employ a combinatorial code to  identify stimuli as points in a high-dimensional space. For example, the simple fruit fly  olfactory system uses the firing rates of 50 different types of odorant receptors to  identify each odor by placing it at a point in a SO-dimensional space. Although the fly olfactory  system is well understood, less is known about analogous regions in vertebrate brains, and our  goal is to begin to learn about these other regions. The first step is to start with the mouse olfactory system that is similar to the fly in some ways but has complexities that are  absent in insects. These complexities include an enhanced ability to handle noise in the  odor and to learn over time to discriminate between very similar odors (e.g., two types of  red wines). Preliminary evidence shows that it should be possible to learn the role of  these complexities in vertebrate olfaction. The research design involves studying the  anatomy and recording the firing rates of different types of neurons at different levels of the  mouse olfactory system and in applying computational methods and algorithms that have  proved successful in earlier work to describe these complexities. The second major goal is to use insights into how these brain regions operate to improve the  function of computer algorithms. For a long time, a dream of many neuroscientists and computer  scientists has been to understand how the brain works well enough that we could translate insights  from the brain to improve machine computation. Indeed, experience has shown that the brain   has evolved novel variations of information processing algorithms used by computer  scientists to solve general computational problems. With sufficient insight into algorithms  used by the brain, these insights may provide unexpected ways to improve the function computer  science algorithms. Further, understanding the circuit mechanisms involved in olfactory processing can help illuminate the basis of a variety of smell disorders, and may  in the future lead to the construction of artificial smelling devices. Our main goal is to understand what computations are used by the mammalian olfactory system; this  has two types of public relevance. First, we hope to learn what circuit mechanisms are used in  this brain region, which may help identify how disruption of these mechanisms causes  brain and olfactory malfunction.

"Cortical Spread of Hippocampal  Hyperactivity in Rett Syndrome PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The hippocampus is critical for the formation and consolidation of spatial memories and, through its efferent projections, also contributes to other cognitive tasks. The goal of this project is to determine whether altered neuronal network activity in the hippocampus of a mouse model of autism propagates to, and alters distal cortical regions involved in social behaviors. A deficit in social interaction is one of the core symptoms of autism spectrum disorders, which includes Rett syndrome (RTT), a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by loss-of-function mutations in the transcriptional regulator MECP2. Altering the excitation and inhibition (E/I) balance in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of mice causes social behavior impairments reminiscent of autism spectrum disorders. The ventral hippocampus (vHIP) of Mecp2 knockout mice (KO) mice is hyperactive due to an E/I imbalance driven by impaired inhibition and enhanced excitation, which results in saturated synaptic plasticity at excitatory synapses. Intriguingly, CA1 pyramidal neurons of the vHIP project their axons to the mPFC, making direct monosynaptic connections with excitatory pyramidal neurons and inhibitory interneurons. We propose to characterize the influence of the vHIP on the activity of the mPFC through this long-range monosynaptic glutamatergic projection, testing whether altered vHIP network activity is causal to mPFC dysfunction and social interaction deficits. We hypothesize that hyperactive hippocampal afferents alter network activity in the mPFC of Mecp2 KO mice by affecting the E/I balance, which contributes to social interaction deficits. To test this hypothesis, we will identify the cellular targets of direct vHIP afferents in the mPFC of RTT mice and characterize their function and role in social behaviors using a combination of optogenetics, chemogenetics, ex vivo and in vivo electrophysiology and Ca2+ imaging, anterograde and retrograde tract tracing, and behavioral assessments. We propose the following Specific Aims: (1) characterize the cellular targets of the monosynaptic projection from the vHIP to the mPFC in Mecp2 KO mice; (2) characterize synaptic function and long-term synaptic plasticity of the monosynaptic projection from the vHIP to the mPFC in Mecp2 KO mice; (3) test if chemogenetic modulation of vHIP activity restores mPFC network activity and social behaviors in Mecp2 KO mice. In addition to defining novel pathophysiological mechanisms of RTT, these studies will provide fundamental information regarding the functional and structural properties of the long-range monosynaptic connection between the vHIP and mPFC in typically developing brains. Thus, the impact of this work will extend beyond RTT to other neuropsychiatric disorders in which propagation of network dysfunction from the hippocampus to the mPFC is thought to contribute to cognitive deficits. PROJECT NARRATIVE Rett syndrome is a syndromic autism-spectrum disorder that presents with deficits in social behaviors and cognitive abilities, which may result from impaired function of the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. The proposed study is the first characterization of a long-range monosynaptic connection in Rett mice using optogenetics and chemogenetics, and will test whether hippocampal hyperactivity propagates to the medial prefrontal cortex, leading to autism-related social deficits.",Cortical Spread of Hippocampal  Hyperactivity in Rett Syndrome,9650793,R56NS103089,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Autistic Disorder ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' Infantile Autism ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Autism ', ' Axon ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Glutamates ', ' glutamatergic ', ' L-Glutamate ', ' Goals ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hippocampus ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Immunohistochemistry ', ' Immunohistochemistry Staining Method ', ' Immunohistochemistry Cell/Tissue ', ' Interneurons ', ' Internuncial Neuron ', ' Internuncial Cell ', ' Intercalated Neurons ', ' Intercalary Neuron ', ' Connector Neuron ', ' Memory ', ' Mus ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Neurons ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Rett Syndrome ', ' Rett Disorder ', ' Cerebroatrophic Hyperammonemia ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Social Behavior ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' sociobehavior ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Synapses ', ' synapse ', ' Synaptic ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Work ', ' Opsin ', ' Rod-Opsin ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' Methyl-DNA binding protein MECP2 ', ' Methyl-CpG binding protein 2 ', ' Methyl CpG binding protein MeCP2 ', ' Methyl CpG Binding Protein 2 ', ' MeCP2 protein ', ' MeCP2 ', ' MeCP-2 protein ', ' Methyl-CpG-Binding Protein 2 ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' Medial ', ' Distal ', ' Site ', ' Synaptic Potentials ', ' Long-Term Potentiation ', ' Null Mouse ', ' Knock-out Mice ', ' KO mice ', ' Knockout Mice ', ' Link ', ' Fiber ', ' Confocal Microscopy ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Morphology ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Hyperactive behavior ', ' Motor Hyperactivity ', ' Hyperkinetic Movements ', ' Hyperkinesis ', ' Hyperkinesia ', ' Hyperactivity ', ' Contralateral ', ' postnatal ', ' System ', ' Membrane ', ' membrane structure ', ' cellular targeting ', ' Cognitive deficits ', ' cognitive defects ', ' novel ', ' Appearance ', ' social ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' Behavior assessment ', ' behavioral assessment ', ' Symptoms ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' in vivo ', ' Excitatory Synapse ', ' Slice ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Neurological Development Disorder ', ' Neurodevelopmental Disorder ', ' Behavioral ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Pyramidal neuron ', ' hippocampal pyramidal neuron ', ' network dysfunction ', ' Synaptic plasticity ', ' loss of function mutation ', ' Impairment ', ' synapse function ', ' synaptic function ', ' murine model ', ' mouse model ', ' impaired behavior ', ' behavioral impairment ', ' optogenetics ', ' cognitive task ', ' cognitive ability ', ' spatial memory ', ' DREADDs ', ' designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' potentiometric dye ', ' voltage sensitive dye ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R56,2018,457549,AL-07,0.02248908953081536
"Neuron and Glial Cellular Signatures from Normal and Diseased iPS Cells-Supplement     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a critical need to define the state and predict the behavior of human brain cells in health and disease. The number of different cell types in the CNS remains undefined, and despite a demographically ordained wave of neurodegenerative diseases, not a single disease-modifying therapy exists. Our  knowledge of the CNS and the foundation for intervening rationally in disease would be dramatically  advanced by generating quantitative molecular phenotypes essentially cell signatures of human neurons,  astrocytes and oligodendrocytes from healthy people and from patients with motor neuron disease,  Huntington's disease, and Parkinson's disease. The CNS is so unique that studying non-neuronal cells does not provide much assistance. Despite this desperate need, the inaccessibility of human brain cells meant studying them would have been impossible until the recent discovery of cellular reprogramming and induced pluripotent stem cell technology.  Here we propose to form the NeuroLINCS consortium to accomplish these goals. We have handpicked the team to bring in critical expertise in iPSC technology, disease modeling, transcriptomics, epigenomics, metabolomics, whole genome sequencing, proteomics, high content, high throughput longitudinal single cell analysis, other cell-based assays, bioinformatics, statistics and computational biology. In addition, we are collaborating with Google to bring in special expertise in machine learning and the integration of signatures across platforms into highly predictive models of responses to perturbagens. Together, we expect to develop cell signatures of an array of human brain cell types under different conditions that should be broadly applicable to the LINCs community. We also anticipate generating innovative software tools and approaches that will make the signature generating process cheaper, faster, and more reliable.  Besides the unique combination of expertise represented within NeuroLINCS, another distinguishing feature is the long track record that its members have of collaborating with each other.

"Building analysis tools and a theory framework for inferring principles of neural computation from multi-scale organization in brain recordings Summary The BRAIN initiative is enabling ground-breaking techniques for brain recordings that will permit a unique view onto the dynamics of neural activity. However, inferring brain function from multi-channel physiological recordings is challenging. A key difficulty is that individual neurons and mesoscopic, often rhythmic, cell populations interact in complicated and recurrent ways. Such complex neuronal dynamics is hard to analyze but very likely important to the functioning of the brain. This proposal will address this problem by developing (1) tools for analyzing brain activity; (2) a theoretical framework for expressing underlying computations and generating experimental predictions. The starting point of the project is our earlier discovery that phase structure in oscillatory local field potentials (LFP) of hippocampal areas CA1/CA3 carry location information in exquisite detail (Agarwal et al. 2014). We will release software tools that make the methods for phase decoding and extracting meaningful LFP components available to the broader community. Further, in collaboration with experimental labs we will research the mechanistic underpinnings of this discovery in hippocampus (Buzsaki NYU, Foster, UC Berkeley), and explore how similar approaches can leverage phase diversity in cortical gamma oscillations (Fries, MPI Frankfurt). The research goal is to develop analysis tools for decoding and extraction of functional components (Aims 1 and 2), applicable to a broad range of multivariate brain recordings of hippocampal and cortical activity. Further, we will develop a flexible two-level theory framework with software tools (Aim 3) to help neuroscientists, in particular experimenters, to formulate putative abstract computations underlying a brain function under study, and build a concrete mechanistic circuit model of those computations. The computational description level will leverage ideas of vector symbolic architectures, a class of connectionist models originally proposed for describing cognitive reasoning (Plate, 1995; Kanerva, 1996). Models produced by the software tool will concisely encapsulate assumptions about the computation and its implementation of a brain function and produce predictions that can be tested in a next generation of recording experiments. The proposed theory framework will be tested in building models for navigation in hippocampus and for visual processing in areas V1 and V4 in cortex. Project narrative: A key difficulty with inferring brain function from recordings of neural activity in a working brain is that the dynamics of individual neurons and mesoscopic, often rhythmic, cell populations interact in complicated and recurrent ways. Here we address this problem by delivering new tools for decoding and decomposing neural population activity, leveraging the recent discovery by the PI of behavior-specific phase structure of local field potentials. Further, we provide software and a theoretical framework for describing models of brain function on a computational and mechanistic level that can produce testable predictions for a new generation of brain recording experiments.",Building analysis tools and a theory framework for inferring principles of neural computation from multi-scale organization in brain recordings,9615743,R01EB026955,"['Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communities ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Electrodes ', ' Goals ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hippocampus ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Monkeys ', ' Neurons ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Periodicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Rattus ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Rat ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Traction ', ' Utah ', ' Vision ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Visual Cortex ', ' visual cortical ', ' Generations ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Encapsulated ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' visual processing ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Structure ', ' Modality ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Modeling ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' theories ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' vector ', ' modeling of the data ', ' model the data ', ' model of data ', ' data modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' next generation ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' independent component analysis ', ' area V1 ', ' area V4 ', ' Population ', ' presynaptic ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' operation ', ' BRAIN initiative ', ' model building ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' high dimensionality ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' ']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2018,351212,CA-13,0.025376289566422804
"Uncovering the molecular identity of retinal cell types, and their responses to nerve injury using single-cell transcriptomics ABSTRACT Neurons of the central nervous system (CNS) have been historically categorized into discrete ""types"" based on structure, physiological responses, connectivity patterns, and molecular profiles. Heterogeneity can have other consequences- e.g. recent studies have found that some neuronal types in the retina are more resilient than other types to optic nerve injury, an event that leads to irrecoverable damage in vision. My project combines cutting-edge single-cell genomic technologies, advanced computational data analysis and molecular tools to define heterogeneity of neuronal types comprehensively, to connect molecular definitions to histology, and explore the functional consequences of this heterogeneity during nerve injury. I will focus on a tractable system, the mouse retina, which communicates visual responses to the brain. It is as complex as any other region of the brain (containing ~120 neuronal types), but benefits from having a compact, accessible structure, and experimental tools make it especially suited for detailed analyses. Building on my previous postdoctoral work, this project will, 1) Complete the census of the mouse retina, which will the first for any CNS region, by inferring molecular taxonomies of two of its most heterogenous classes (amacrines and ganglion cells) from data collected using high-throughput single-cell RNA-sequencing. Using the mouse census, initiate a similar mapping of the macaque retina, which is harder to access experimentally, but shares important features with humans that are absent in mice. 2) Conduct a systematic investigation of cell-type specific responses in the retina to optic nerve injury. This usually leads to a rapid, stereotypic death of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), but a recent study by my colleagues reported that some RGC types are more resilient than others. Here, using 1) as a resource, I will identify factors, cell intrinsic and extrinsic, that make these RGC types resilient. 3) Selective resilience of cell types is now recognized as a feature of diseases like glaucoma and stroke. Therapies therefore need to cater to different cell types. To learn more, and derive general principles, I will examine the impact of known therapeutic interventions on the survival of different RGC types, and the underlying molecular responses, within the optic nerve injury model. Taken together, my project will derive substantial molecular information underlying neuronal heterogeneity in the mouse and macaque retina and general principles for cell-type selective resilience following CNS injury in mice. The lessons from this work will provide valuable guidance for similar studies in less accessible regions of the brain (e.g. cerebral cortex).   NARRATIVE The central nervous system (CNS) is made up of a large diversity of neuronal types, a major proportion of which remain to be identified and defined in terms of molecular markers so that their roles in function and dysfunction can be assessed. This project seeks to combine high-throughput single-cell transcriptomics, innovative computational and histological methods to comprehensively define neuronal heterogeneity in an accessible system – the mouse retina, and use this as a foundation to (1) initiate a similar mapping of the macaque retina, and (2) study cell-type specific responses in a tractable model of nerve injury (optic nerve crush) to map the resilience of different cell types, and identify molecular correlates underlying these differences. Our work will create transformational tools to address similar challenges in other CNS regions.","Uncovering the molecular identity of retinal cell types, and their responses to nerve injury using single-cell transcriptomics",9431808,K99EY028625,"['Optic Nerve ', ' Second Cranial Nerve ', ' Cranial Nerve II ', ' Physiology ', ' Natural regeneration ', ' regenerate ', ' Regeneration ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Retina ', ' Retinal Ganglion Cells ', ' retinal ganglion ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Technology ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Vertebrates ', ' vertebrata ', ' Vertebrate Animals ', ' Vision ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Work ', ' Molecular Genetics ', ' Mediating ', ' Taxonomy ', ' General Taxonomy ', ' Traumatic Optic Neuropathy ', ' Second Cranial Nerve Trauma ', ' Second Cranial Nerve Injuries ', ' Optic Nerve Trauma ', ' Cranial Nerve II Injuries ', ' Optic Nerve Injuries ', ' neural injury ', ' nerve injury ', ' Custom ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' Histologically ', ' Histologic ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' gangliocyte ', ' ganglion cell ', ' Amacrine Cells ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' Morphology ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Immune ', ' Immunes ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' neuroprotection ', ' Recovery of Function ', ' functional recovery ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Structure ', ' Reporting ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Genomics ', ' Neuraxis ', ' Central Nervous System ', ' CNS Nervous System ', ' central nervous system injury ', ' injured CNS ', ' CNS Injury ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' molecular signature ', ' molecular profile ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' in vivo ', ' computer analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computational analyses ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' Molecular ', ' Behavioral ', ' injured ', ' knockdown ', ' knock-down ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' resilience ', ' Retinal ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' transcriptomics ', ' retinal neuron ', ' novel biomarker ', ' new marker ', ' novel marker ', ' molecular biomarker ', ' molecular marker ', ' human model ', ' single cell RNA-seq ', ' scRNA-seq ', ' single-cell RNA sequencing ', ' stroke-like ischemic event ', ' stroke-like insult ', ' stroke-like injury ', ' stroke-like event ', ' stroke-like episode ', ' Axon ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Felis catus ', ' Felis sylvestris catus ', ' Felis domesticus ', ' Felis domestica ', ' Feline Species ', ' Domestic Cats ', ' Cats Mammals ', ' Cats ', ' Cell Communication ', ' Cell-to-Cell Interaction ', ' Cell Interaction ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Censuses ', ' Cerebral cortex ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Foundations ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Glaucoma ', ' glaucomatous ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Histology ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Inflammation ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Learning ', ' Macaca ', ' Macaque ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Mus ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Nerve Crush ', ' Neurons ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurosciences ', ' ']",NEI,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",K99,2018,107618,MA-07,0.03336157137193597
"Using deep brain stimulation of the parietal cortex to investigate the electrophysiology of human episodic memory Project Summary Our proposal seeks to build upon the success of our lab investigating the electrophysiology of human memory through novel experiments that will elucidate hippocampal—parietal interactions in memory processing. The key innovations of this proposal are the application of direct brain stimulation to the mesial parietal cortex and the adaptation of an associative recognition paradigm to intracranial data. We will take advantage of our high-volume epilepsy surgical center specializing in stereo EEG electrode implantation. In our first aim, we will compare how electrophysiological patterns of brain activation differ between free recall (which comprises the bulk of intracranial memory data) and associative recognition, specifically examining properties of theta oscillations in the anterior versus posterior hippocampus. In the second aim, we will apply deep brain stimulation to the mesial parietal cortex during memory encoding and retrieval, observing differences in memory performance and hippocampal oscillatory activity that will inform hypotheses of how this area supports episodic memory. In Aim 3, we will use machine learning classifiers to understand how mesial parietal stimulation affects memory performance via its impact on brain oscillatory activity in a responsive stimulation paradigm. These experiments will utilize our lab’s knowledge and infrastructure gained through participation in the DARPA Restoring Active Memory project. While our proposal is highly innovative, our center’s proven success in recruiting a large volume of stereo EEG patients for memory research, data collection, and the application of advanced analytic techniques give us confidence that we will collect high quality data addressing the critical gaps in the understanding of human memory. Project Narrative Two critical gaps in our understanding of human memory are whether or not hippocampal theta oscillations support encoding in the same manner as in rodents, and the contribution of the mesial parietal cortex in encoding versus retrieval. These questions are closely linked together, and we propose to study them in stereo EEG patients using a novel memory paradigm coupled with deep brain stimulation. Our planned experiments include a closed-loop stimulation paradigm seeking to use parietal stimulation to improve memory performance, the results of which will both inform theories of human episodic memory processing and of the design of therapeutic brain stimulation devices to treat cognitive deficits.",Using deep brain stimulation of the parietal cortex to investigate the electrophysiology of human episodic memory,9576061,R01NS107357,"['Affect ', ' Aging ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Data Collection ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electrodes ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Epilepsy ', ' epileptogenic ', ' epileptiform ', ' epilepsia ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' Epileptics ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Exhibits ', ' Goals ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hippocampus ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Literature ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' hepatic body system ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Parietal Lobe ', ' parietal cortex ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Rodentia ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Societies ', ' Temporal Lobe ', ' temporal cortex ', ' Testing ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' thalamic ', ' Thalamus ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Lateral ', ' Anterior ', ' Area ', ' Animal Experiments ', ' Link ', ' Data Quality ', ' analog ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Attenuated ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Deep Brain Stimulation ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Parietal ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' memory recognition ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Episodic memory ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' memory process ', ' memory processing ', ' memory retrieval ', ' Cognitive deficits ', ' cognitive defects ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Memory Loss ', ' memory decline ', ' Property ', ' theories ', ' Brain region ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Degenerative Disorder ', ' degenerative disease ', ' degenerative condition ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Retrieval ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' direct application ', ' Coupled ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' implantation ', ' human disease ', ' memory encoding ', ' novel therapy approach ', ' novel therapeutic approach ', ' new therapy approaches ', ' new therapeutic strategies ', ' new therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic approach ', ' novel therapeutic intervention ', ' human imaging ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NINDS,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2018,359433,TX-30,0.03733364866758693
"Mozak: Creating an Expert Community to accelerate neuronal reconstruction at scale Project Summary This project aims to leverage the best of both computational and human expertise in neuronal reconstruction towards the goal of accelerating global neuroscience discovery from internationally-sourced imaging data. We propose to create a cloud-based unified platform for converging 3-dimensional images of neurons onto a single analysis platform to (1) train and grow a new expert community of global reconstructors to work across the data from these groups, to (2) generate a community-sourced neuronal reconstruction database of open imaging data that can be incorporated into a 3-dimensional map of neuronal interconnectivity - onto which (3) novel annotations and more complex functional and molecular data can be overlaid. Our approach will evolve with the growing needs of the neuroscience community over time. To do this, in Aim One (Neuronal Reconstruction at Scale), we will test if the newly developed crowd-sourced game-based platform Mozak can develop a collective of new human experts at scale, capable of accelerating the rate of current reconstruction by at least an order of magnitude, at the same time as increasing the robustness, quality and unbiasedness of the final reconstructions. In Aim Two (Robust Multi-Purpose Annotation), we will enhance basic neuronal reconstruction by adding specific semantic annotation— including soma volume and morphological quantification, volumetric analysis, and ongoing features (e.g. dendritic spines, axonal varicosities) requested from the neuroscience community. Experienced and high-ranking members will be given the opportunity to advance through increasingly complex neurons into full arbor brain-wide neuronal projections and multiple clustered groups of neurons in localized circuits. Finally, in Aim 3 (Creation of a Research-Adaptive Data Repository), we aim to develop a database of neuronal images reconstructed using the Mozak interface that will directly serve the general and specific needs of different research groups. Our goal is to make this database dynamically adaptive — as new research questions will invariably bring new needs for additional annotations and cross-referencing with other data modalities. This highquality unbiased processing repository will also be perfectly suited for training sets for automated algorithms, and the generation of a 3-dimensional maps such as Allen Institute for Brain Science (AIBS) common coordinate framework. We expect that the computational reconstruction methods will further improve with the new large corpus of “gold standard” reconstructions. Collectively, the completion of these three aims will create an analysis suite as well as an online community of experts capable of performing in depth analysis of large-scale datasets that will significantly accelerate neuroscience research, enhance machine learning for reconstruction analysis, and create a common platform of baseline neuronal morphology data against which aberrantly functioning neurons can be analyzed. Project Narrative  This project will create a new central nexus point for neuronal reconstruction and semantic annotation (Mozak) that can be used by all research labs via an accessible online portal. We will develop a new cadre of neuronal reconstruction experts that will— in conjunction with automated tools that are enhanced by their work — drastically increase the volume, quality and robustness of neuron reconstructions and annotations. Mozak reconstructions will be shared with existing repositories and will be continually updated and re-annotated based on emerging needs of research - ensuring perpetual relevance, and allowing us to generate a platform to establish the range of “baseline” 3-dimensional readouts of neuronal morphology against which diseased or malfunctioning neurons can be analyzed and understood. 1",Mozak: Creating an Expert Community to accelerate neuronal reconstruction at scale,9594042,R01MH116247,"['Algorithms ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Sources ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Institutes ', ' Laboratories ', ' Manuals ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Neurons ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Research ', ' Science ', ' Semantics ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Varicosity ', ' Varicose Veins ', ' Varices ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Nexus Junction ', ' Nexus ', ' Low-resistance Junction ', ' Communicating Junction ', ' Gap Junctions ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' Morphology ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' 3-D ', ' experience ', ' neuronal cell body ', ' soma ', ' neural cell body ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Modality ', ' repository ', ' Dendritic Spines ', ' dendrite spine ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Neurosciences Research ', ' Slice ', ' Update ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Output ', ' reconstruction ', ' 3D analysis ', ' 3-dimensional analysis ', ' 3-D analysis ', ' Three-dimensional analysis ', ' Outcome ', ' Imaging technology ', ' 2-dimensional ', ' two-dimensional ', ' cloud based ', ' scientific citizenship ', ' crowd-sourced science ', ' crowd science ', ' civic science ', ' citizen scientists ', ' amateur scientists ', ' amateur science ', ' citizen science ', ' crowdsource ', ' crowd-sourcing ', ' crowd source ', ' crowdsourcing ', ' virtual community ', ' online community ', ' petabyte ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Banks ', ' data warehouse ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2018,661507,WA-07,0.010326571411315367
"Mechanisms of neural circuit dynamics in working memory anddecision-making Project Summary Working memory, the ability to temporarily hold multiple pieces of information in mind for manipulation, is central to virtually all cognitive abilities. Recent technical advances have opened an unprecedented opportunity to comprehensively dissect the neural circuit mechanisms of this ability across multiple brain areas. The task to be studied is a common form of decision-making that is based on the gradual accumulation of sensory evidence and thus relies on working memory. A team of leading experts propose to investigate the neural basis of this behavior using the latest techniques, including virtual reality, high-throughput automated behavioral training, large-scale cellular-resolution imaging in behaving rodents, manipulation of neural activity in specific brain areas and cell types, and automated anatomical reconstruction. In particular, the researchers will identify key brain regions that are required for this decision task through systematic, temporally specific inactivations via optogenetics technology, across all of dorsal cortex and in key subcortical areas, and use quantitative model-fitting to evaluate the effects. They will use state-of-the-art two-photon calcium imaging methods and electrophysiology to characterize the information flow in many individual neurons within these brain areas during the task. In addition, they will use cutting-edge anatomical reconstructions and new functional connectivity methods, within and across brain regions, to evaluate the interactions of these physiologically characterized neurons. The long-term goal of this project is to arrive at a complete, brain-wide understanding of the cellular and circuit mechanisms of activity dynamics related to working memory. Finally, they will use sophisticated computational methods to incorporate this new understanding into a realistic circuit model that will support a tightly integrated process of model-guided experimental design, in which the model suggests the most informative experiments and their results are then fed back to improve the model’s fidelity. This process is expected to produce the most accurate and detailed multi-brain-region biophysical circuit model of a cognitive process in existence. In addition, the proposed research will enable researchers to generate and test a variety of hypotheses about the neural basis of evidence accumulation, working memory, and decision-making. Taken together, these achievements will represent a crucial step toward a mechanistic understanding of how the brain works with information. Working memory, the capacity to temporarily hold multiple pieces of information in mind for manipulation , is central to almost all cognitive abilities.

"MACHINE LEARNING APPROACHES FOR ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL CELL CLASSIFICATION ABSTRACT We will use our expertise in somatosensory organization and plasticity to develop novel and automated solutions for cell identification based upon neural activity, in order to decode the algorithms neural circuits use for information processing. Extracellular recordings in sensory cortex have been thought to primarily represent excitatory neuron activity, since these cells comprise ~80% of the total cell population. However, targeted cell recordings in S1 reveal that firing activity is dominated by inhibitory neurons, and that excitatory neurons can show 10-100 fold lower firing rates depending on cortical layer. Furthermore, new findings that reveal the complex relationship between different subtypes of inhibitory neurons make it difficult to relate blindly-recorded firing activity to local- or network-level computations. Clearly, cell-types matter, and massively parallel extracellular recordings that do not enable the simultaneous identification of multiple cell types will be limited in identifying principles for information transmission and encoding. Based on our preliminary findings, we hypothesize that the complex spontaneous and evoked spike trains from molecularly-identified neurons will provide unique and cell-type specific signatures that will enable cell identification from in vivo extracellular recordings. In collaboration with computer scientists at Carnegie Mellon, we will develop machine-learning algorithms for cell classification, using data collected from in vitro and in vivo recordings. NARRATIVE  Discovery of the Rosetta stone was an archaeological breakthrough, enabling translation of Egyptian hieroglyphics from parallel texts in ancient Greek. Understanding how the activity of different neuronal subtypes contributes to information processing in the brain is in desperate need of a similar cipher. Detailed studies in the cerebral cortex have revealed principles of how small groups of neurons work together, but these small-scale interactions have been difficult to relate to computations performed by larger groups of neurons, typically recorded without knowledge of cell identity, during animal perception and behavior. We will use advances in molecular-cell identification techniques and machine learning to create an automated classifier to decipher cell identity from dense electrophysiological recordings and decode brain function from neural activity.",MACHINE LEARNING APPROACHES FOR ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL CELL CLASSIFICATION,9568053,R21NS104821,"['Algorithms ', ' Animals ', ' Archaeology ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cerebral cortex ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Cognition ', ' Computers ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Dissent ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Goals ', ' In Vitro ', ' Interneurons ', ' Internuncial Neuron ', ' Internuncial Cell ', ' Intercalated Neurons ', ' Intercalary Neuron ', ' Connector Neuron ', ' Methods ', ' Mus ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Neurons ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Parvalbumins ', ' Perception ', ' Publishing ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Somatostatin ', ' growth hormone release inhibiting factor ', ' Somatotropin Release-Inhibiting Hormone ', ' Somatotropin Release Inhibiting Factors ', ' Somatostatin-14 ', ' SRIH-14 ', ' SRIH ', ' Growth Hormone-Inhibiting Hormone ', ' Growth Hormone Inhibiting Factors ', ' Cyclic Somatostatin ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' thalamic ', ' Thalamus ', ' Translations ', ' Work ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Fiber ', ' Clear Cell ', ' Stimulus ', ' awake ', ' Collaborations ', ' Greek ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Distant ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' extracellular ', ' Performance ', ' sensory cortex ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' novel ', ' Neurophysiology - biologic function ', ' neural function ', ' Cortical Column ', ' Renal Column of Bertini ', ' Column of Bertini ', ' neural circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' Data ', ' in vivo ', ' Collection ', ' Slice ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Molecular ', ' Text ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' excitatory neuron ', ' inhibitory neuron ', ' virtual ', ' Population ', ' somatosensory ', ' information processing ', ' optogenetics ', ' cognitive process ', ' behavior response ', ' behavioral response ', ' ']",NINDS,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,197625,PA-18,0.046564791205141155
"CRCNS: US-Japan Research Proposal: The Computational Principles of a Neural Face Processing System There is a fundamental gap in our understanding of the computational principles and neural mechanisms by which neural circuits represent complex objects like faces. This conceptual gap constitutes an important problem because, until it is filled, we will not be able to understand face recognition and the reasons for face blindness. The long-term goal is to understand the computational principles and neural mechanisms of face recognition and create a computer face-recognition system based on these principles. The overall objective of this proposal is the determination of the computational principles of local and global face feature coding in the brain's face-processing network. The central hypothesis is that high-level feature tuning in face-selective areas can be understood as the result of the statistical properties of stimulus space and general organizational features of the circuits that process these stimuli. The rationale for this proposal is that completion of the proposed research will provide an understanding, of how neural circuits generate a meaningful representation of complex visual shape, imposing critical constraints on theories of vision. The hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims, which will determine 1) neural mechanism for facial feature tuning, 2) neural mechanism for categorical face selectivity, and 3) neural mechanisms for transformations of feature tuning. The joint computational and experimental approach will integrate functional magnetic resonance imaging to localize face areas with electrophysiological recordings targeted to these regions and computational analyses of model systems. The approach is innovative through the tight coupling of theoretical principles and experimental validation and by developing novel theoretical and experimental methodologies. The proposed research is significant, because it will unravel principles of neural circuit function that are of general relevance for understanding visual object recognition and multi-node networks. Because the outcome is an advance in understanding circuit mechanisms of social perception, it will identify vulnerabilities of the face-processing system directly relevant to the understanding of face blindness, prosopagnosia, and of altered social perception in syndromes spanning autism spectrum disorders, fragile X, and Williams syndrome. The proposed research is relevant to public health because the neural mechanisms of face processing are essential to human social life, and altered social perception is characteristic of many pervasive neurodevelopmental disorders. Studies proposed in this application will identify the computational principles of face recognition circuitry and suggest how alterations to these circuits impair function.

"Revealing the transcriptomic basis of neuronal identity through functional meta-analysis PROJECT SUMMARY Our overarching goal is to understand how the relationships between genes contribute to functional properties in neurons and how those functions combine to define types of neurons. This is a central question of basic neuroscience, and one which is newly assessable using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). These data provide high-throughput snapshots of gene activities across thousands of cells and thus shed new light on the relationships between genes within and across cells. We propose to exploit this data in conjunction with previously known details about gene function and neuronal identity to learn new features of both. Our research approach is meta-analytic, using data from many different laboratories to obtain a more robust aggregate signal. In addition to developing meta-analytic methods to pursue our direct research interests, the methods are of broad practical relevance to neuroscience laboratories studying many different questions, including diseases of the nervous system. Disseminating our software deliverables in a convenient-to-use form is a central component of each of our research objectives. The three complementary objectives in this project are to: 1. Learn patterns of gene expression which characterize known cell identity. Building on our previous research showing conserved expression patterns across cell-types, we will define shared gene expression patterns, called co-expression, specific to neuronal sub-populations. These shared expression patterns will be used as an assay into cellular identity. 2.Identify novel cell subtypes through changes in the expression relationships between genes. Variation in co-expression is a form of transcriptional rewiring which often indicates a change in function. To find novel neuronal sub-types we will assess the data for changes in co-expression reflecting a change in functions linked to neuronal identity. We will identify novel transcriptional signatures which replicate across laboratories. 3. Determine consensus methods for customized cell-type learning. Defining wholly unknown expression profiles is likely to benefit from a variety of approaches. In order to find agreement between those approaches, we will develop an algorithm to efficiently search through gene sets likely to find those with complementary value. These gene sets will then be assessed across many pre-existing methods, with customized combinations and aggregate output reported and made available through a public web-server. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent advances in genetics have it made possible to assess gene activity at a cellular level. The primary goal of this project is to develop and validate methods and data resources which combine data from many laboratories to identify how genes interact to produce different functional effects in different types of neurons. Because most gene functions are accomplished in concert with other genes, knowing how genes change their interactions provides key information into how their function might be disrupted in disease.",Revealing the transcriptomic basis of neuronal identity through functional meta-analysis,9527869,R01MH113005,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communities ', ' Crowding ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Joints ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' Libraries ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Methods ', ' Nervous system structure ', ' Neurologic Organ System ', ' Neurologic Body System ', ' Nervous System ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurons ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Noise ', ' Phenotype ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Work ', ' Custom ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' Genetic ', ' gene function ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Consensus ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' exhaustion ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' Ablation ', ' functional group ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Agreement ', ' Laboratory Study ', ' Reporting ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Property ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Meta-Analyses ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Transcript ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' groupings ', ' Grouping ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Output ', ' transcriptional signature ', ' gene expression signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' Expression Signature ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' transcriptomics ', ' candidate biomarker ', ' candidate marker ', ' screening ', ' Data Discovery ', ' data resource ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' in situ sequencing ', ' single cell RNA-seq ', ' scRNA-seq ', ' single-cell RNA sequencing ', ' ']",NIMH,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,R01,2018,472477,NY-03,0.057852380733352006
"Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles Abstract (of the Parent Award) Anxiety and related disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), are leading causes of global disability. Brain circuit abnormalities have been identified, but important knowledge gaps remain. It is unclear which abnormalities underlie what symptom profiles, how dysfunction develops and thus which brain abnormalities to target with new interventions. Moreover, circuit abnormalities likely cut across traditional diagnostic categories and, within a diagnostic category, there is individual variability. Our approach is to identify reproducible brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms; these brain signatures can then be used to reveal trans-diagnostic disease dimensions, to chart their development, and to develop treatments that target these circuit abnormalities directly.  The goal of this proposal is to identify reproducible brain signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD. To accomplish this, we will study 250 unmedicated OCD and 250 healthy control subjects (HCs) at five expert research sites spanning five countries (U.S., Brazil, India, Netherlands, and South Africa). Using imaging methods that could ultimately be adapted for clinical use, we will examine multiple brain circuits thought to underlie OCD behaviors, focusing on morphometry (using T1- weighted MRI), structural connectivity (using Diffusion Tensor Imaging [DTI]), and functional connectivity (using resting-state fMRI [rs-fMRI]). We will identify neuroimaging signatures that distinguish individuals with OCD from HCs by analyzing each modality with standardized protocols and by using multi-modal fusion with modern machine learning statistical methods. We will then examine how these imaging signatures are linked to behavioral performance on cognitive tasks that probe these same circuits and to a range of clinical profiles that are common to OCD. Finally, we will explore how specific environmental features (childhood trauma, socioeconomic status, religiosity) may moderate this brain-behavior relationship. Our short-term goal is to identify brain signatures of OCD cognitive and clinical profiles, leveraging our global collaboration both to recruit a very large unmedicated sample and to prove these signatures' reproducibility. Our long-term goal is to identify brain signatures for measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms that cut across traditional diagnostic categories and to use these signatures to transform how we conceptualize, diagnose and ultimately treat mental illnesses like OCD. This administrative supplement proposes to add a sample of unaffected siblings (n=100, 20 per site over four years) as an additional comparison sample to the 250 OCD and 250 healthy control (HC) subjects already being studied in the parent study. These siblings will complete the same clinical, neurocognitive, and imaging measures as the 250 OCD and 250 healthy control subjects complete in the parent study.",Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles,9689131,R01MH113250,"['Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Disorders ', ' behavioral disorder ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brazil ', ' Cognition Disorders ', ' cognitive syndrome ', ' cognitive disorder ', ' cognitive disease ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Goals ', ' India ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Modernization ', ' Netherlands ', ' Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder ', ' Obsessive-Compulsive Neurosis ', ' Parents ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Siblings ', ' South Africa ', ' Standardization ', ' Measures ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' morphometry ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Collaborations ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Knowledge ', ' Dimensions ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Country ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' Performance ', ' Obsessive compulsive behavior ', ' obsessive compulsive ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' Categories ', ' Modality ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' dMRI ', ' Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Diffusion weighted imaging ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' DWI-MRI ', ' DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) ', ' imaging modality ', ' imaging method ', ' image-based method ', ' Symptoms ', ' Administrative Supplement ', ' Measurable ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Cognitive ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' childhood trauma ', ' adolescent trauma ', ' pediatric trauma ', ' brain behavior ', ' anxiety-related disorders ', ' cognitive task ', ' brain abnormalities ', ' recruit ', ' individual variability ', ' individual heterogeneity ', ' individual variation ', ' ']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2018,213060,NY-13,-0.06212454510260488
"Neuron and Glial Cellular Signatures from Normal and Diseased iPS Cells     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a critical need to define the state and predict the behavior of human brain cells in health and disease. The number of different cell types in the CNS remains undefined, and despite a demographically ordained wave of neurodegenerative diseases, not a single disease-modifying therapy exists. Our  knowledge of the CNS and the foundation for intervening rationally in disease would be dramatically  advanced by generating quantitative molecular phenotypes essentially cell signatures of human neurons,  astrocytes and oligodendrocytes from healthy people and from patients with motor neuron disease,  Huntington's disease, and Parkinson's disease.

Despite this desperate need, the inaccessibility of human brain cells meant studying them would have been impossible until the recent discovery of cellular reprogramming and induced pluripotent stem cell technology.  Here we propose to form the NeuroLINCS consortium to accomplish these goals. We have handpicked the team to bring in critical expertise in iPSC technology, disease modeling, transcriptomics, epigenomics, metabolomics, whole genome sequencing, proteomics, high content, high throughput longitudinal single cell analysis, other cell-based assays, bioinformatics, statistics and computational biology. In addition, we are collaborating with Google to bring in special expertise in machine learning and the integration of signatures across platforms into highly predictive models of responses to perturbagens. Together, we expect to develop cell signatures of an array of human brain cell types under different conditions that should be broadly applicable to the LINCs community. We also anticipate generating innovative software tools and approaches that will make the signature generating process cheaper, faster, and more reliable.

"Neuron and Glial Cellular Signatures from Normal and Diseased iPS Cells     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a critical need to define the state and predict the behavior of human brain cells in health and disease. The number of different cell types in the CNS remains undefined, and despite a demographically ordained wave of neurodegenerative diseases, not a single disease-modifying therapy exists. Our  knowledge of the CNS and the foundation for intervening rationally in disease would be dramatically  advanced by generating quantitative molecular phenotypes essentially cell signatures of human neurons,  astrocytes and oligodendrocytes from healthy people and from patients with motor neuron disease,  Huntington's disease, and Parkinson's disease. The CNS is so unique that studying non-neuronal cells does not provide much assistance. Despite this desperate need, the inaccessibility of human brain cells meant studying them would have been impossible until the recent discovery of cellular reprogramming and induced pluripotent stem cell technology.  Here we propose to form the NeuroLINCS consortium to accomplish these goals. We have handpicked the team to bring in critical expertise in iPSC technology, disease modeling, transcriptomics, epigenomics, metabolomics, whole genome sequencing, proteomics, high content, high throughput longitudinal single cell analysis, other cell-based assays, bioinformatics, statistics and computational biology. In addition, we are collaborating with Google to bring in special expertise in machine learning and the integration of signatures across platforms into highly predictive models of responses to perturbagens. Together, we expect to develop cell signatures of an array of human brain cell types under different conditions that should be broadly applicable to the LINCs community. We also anticipate generating innovative software tools and approaches that will make the signature generating process cheaper, faster, and more reliable.  Besides the unique combination of expertise represented within NeuroLINCS, another distinguishing feature is the long track record that its members have of collaborating with each other. That collaborative spirit will be expressed in NeuroLINCS through its significant and multifaceted community outreach programs.

"Meta-analysis to define neuronal diversity: from genes to functions across species Project Summary To begin unraveling the mysteries of the brain we must first understand its fundamental unit: the neuron. Recent advances in single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology have resulted in the rapid generation of high dimensional data for individual cells, revealing vast heterogeneity and enabling the prediction of novel cell subtypes based on expression patterns. In spite of this wealth of data, a theoretical framework to define subtype identity is lacking. Cross-laboratory expression analysis has emerged as a powerful approach to obtain robust and replicable results and we have previously shown that scRNA-seq data is readily amenable to gene co-expression meta-analysis. Here, we propose that these methods, in combination with cross-species analysis, will provide important validation of novel subtypes, and allow for the identification of new gene functional modules that drive neuronal diversity. Our overall hypothesis is that coordinated gene expression patterns underlie neuronal identity and function. The specific aims to address this hypothesis combine both computational and experimental approaches. First, we will characterize cell-type specific co-expression using RNA-seq data from bulk tissue and from single cells, defining best practices for network construction and identifying and characterizing gene modules that are unique to single cell data. Second, we will define a data- driven cell type taxonomy for the mouse and human nervous systems, and use this to identify neuronal subtype marker genes for validation with co-in situ hybridization and follow up with gene targeting and further scRNA-seq experiments. Finally, we will elucidate functional pathways that are unique to or conserved across species by comparing mouse and human neuronal subtype co-expression networks, with a particular focus on characterizing the cell type specific connectivity of psychiatric disease genes. These aims are consistent with the National Institute of Mental Health's strategic plan to describe the molecules, cells and neural circuits associated with complex behaviors. As a result, these studies will have a significant impact on our understanding of neuronal diversity and identity, leading to improved understanding of the molecular pathology of brain disorders. Project Narrative It has long been known that there are many different kinds of neurons that are involved in controlling brain activity. However, it is unclear precisely how many different types of neurons exist, and to what degree human neurons resemble those of other animals. In this project we propose that by combining information about the gene activity in both human and mouse neurons we will begin to put together a final `parts list' of the nervous system which we can use to understand brain disorders.",Meta-analysis to define neuronal diversity: from genes to functions across species,9513320,F32MH114501,"['Animals ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communities ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Laboratories ', ' Methods ', ' Mus ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Nervous system structure ', ' Neurologic Organ System ', ' Neurologic Body System ', ' Nervous System ', ' Neurons ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Research ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translations ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Molecular Genetics ', ' Taxonomy ', ' General Taxonomy ', ' in situ Hybridization Staining Method ', ' in situ Hybridization Genetics ', ' In Situ Hybridization ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Gene Targeting ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Complex ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' molecular pathology ', ' Performance ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Gene Expression Profiling ', ' transcriptional profiling ', ' gene expression assay ', ' gene expression analysis ', ' Transcript Expression Analysis ', ' Transcript Expression Analyses ', ' Gene Expression Pattern Analysis ', ' Gene Expression Monitoring ', ' neural circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Meta-Analyses ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' computerized data processing ', ' data processing ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Ontology ', ' Validation ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' transcriptional signature ', ' gene expression signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' Expression Signature ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' transcriptomics ', ' comparative ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' high dimensionality ', ' single cell RNA-seq ', ' scRNA-seq ', ' single-cell RNA sequencing ', ' ']",NIMH,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,F32,2018,51923,NY-03,0.040391964600759285
"CRCNS: Computational and neural mechanisms of memory-guided decisions DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): What aspects of previous experiences guide decisions? Much research concerns how the brain computes the average, over many experiences, of rewards received for an option. But such a summary - produced by prominent models of dopaminergic incremental learning- is chiefly useful for repetitive tasks. Much less is understood about how the brain can flexibly evaluate new or changing options in more realistic tasks, which must rely on less aggregated information. This application argues that this is fundamentally a function of memory, so this project looks to the brain's memories for the most individuated experiences - episodes - to seek new computational, cognitive and neural mechanisms that could support more flexible decisions. The overarching hypothesis is that episodic memory, supported by the hippocampus, plays a central role in guiding flexible decision making and complements the wellknown role of dopaminergic and striatal systems in incremental learning of value.     What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity? By connecting the computational neuroscience of decision making with the cognitive neuroscience of memory, and bringing together collaborators from each area, this project promises to shed light on both areas. This is because the neural mechanisms supporting episodic memory are well studied, but less so their contribution to adaptive behavior. Computationally, episodic memories can support a family of learning algorithms that draw on sparse, individual experiences, such as Monte Carlo and kernel methods. These suggest novel, plausible hypotheses for how the brain solves more realistic decision problems, and in particular how it implements ""goal-directed"" or ""model-based"" choices. The proposed studies aim to differentiate the contributions of incremental and episodic learning to value-based decisions, and test to what extent episodic memories contribute to decisions previously identified as model-based. Our hypotheses are tested fitting computational models to neural activity from functional MRI experiments in humans, and also to choice behavior in healthy individuals compared to patients with isolated damage to specific neural systems. This combination of computational, neuroimaging and neuropsychological approaches permits finely tracing the trial-by-trial dynamics of learning as reflected both in brain activity nd behavior, and also testing the causal role of particular brain regions in these same processes.     What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity? A striking range of psychiatric and neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and eating disorders, are accompanied by aberrant decision-making and by dysfunction in circuitry central to this proposal, such as striatal and fronto-temporal mechanisms. But understanding such dysfunction requires a better understanding of how each of these circuits separately influences decisions. A focus on untangling multiple decision systems is particularly pertinent to disorders such as drug abuse, which is hypothesized to center on the compromise of incremental reinforcement mechanisms that may support more habitual actions and underlie the compulsive nature of such diseases. At the same time, drugs may also weaken or compromise more deliberative or goal-directed choice systems that might otherwise be able to support more advantageous decisions. Formally understanding the roles played by both of these influences, and how they interact, promises to improve the conceptualization, diagnosis, and treatment of these and other disorders. The proposed program also provides unique opportunities for training and education. By integrating multiple core tools of systems and cognitive neuroscience (computational modeling, functional imaging, patient studies, behavioral analyses), students in the labs of both PIs are trained in different approaches to a unified research question, preparing them to be effective scientists in a more interdisciplinary future. Components of this training will also be extended to undergraduate and high school student populations through existing programs at both NYU and at Columbia and through outreach to New York area schools. This project will also help promote broader representation of minorities in science, including women. As a female neuroscientist with many women trainees in her laboratory, PI Shohamy serves as a role model and the collaborative project facilitates training for women in computational neuroscience, an area in which women are particularly underrepresented. Drug abuse is acquired through learning. Much research focuses on the involvement of dopaminergic  incremental learning processes. But other learning and memory systems are likely to also contribute to  aspects, such as drug-seeking, not well explained by those mechanisms. By isolating the contribution of  different memory systems to learned choice, this project may help to guide future treatment strategies.",CRCNS: Computational and neural mechanisms of memory-guided decisions,9506737,R01DA038891,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Choice Behavior ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' striatal ', ' Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Cues ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Drug abuse ', ' abuses drugs ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Eating Disorders ', ' Family ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hippocampus ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Memory ', ' Midbrain structure ', ' Midbrain ', ' Mid-brain ', ' Mesencephalon ', ' Monte Carlo Method ', ' Monte Carlo simulation ', ' Monte Carlo procedure ', ' Monte Carlo calculation ', ' Monte Carlo algorithm ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neuropsychology ', ' neuropsychologic ', ' Neuropsychologies ', ' New York ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Parkinsons disease ', "" Parkinson's disease "", "" Parkinson's "", ' Parkinson ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Research ', ' Rewards ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Schools ', ' Science ', ' Specificity ', ' statistics ', ' Students ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Adaptive Behaviors ', ' adaptive behavior ', ' adaptation behavior ', ' Dissociation ', ' base ', ' computational neuroscience ', ' role model ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' System ', ' Training and Education ', ' Education and Training ', ' Episodic memory ', ' experience ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' novel ', ' behavior test ', ' behavioral test ', ' outreach ', ' Modeling ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' physiological imaging ', ' Physiologic Imaging ', ' Functional Imaging ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' neural mechanism ', ' neuromechanism ', ' cognitive neuroscience ', ' dopamine system ', ' treatment strategy ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' undergraduate ', ' undergraduate student ', ' Secondary Student ', ' Secondary School Student ', ' High School Student ', ' neural correlate ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' training opportunity ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' ']",NIDA,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,326829,NJ-12,0.043312008693451226
"Data-driven analysis for neuronal dynamic modeling Project Summary / Abstract Our main goal is to unravel communication dynamics in the brain, as they relate to various sensory-motor actions and to the learning process. The sensory-motor system operates through the concerted interaction of multiple closed-loops feedback systems. While some broad level knowledge is available about single neuron properties and general high-level operations, we lack understanding of functional aspects of neural dynamics, of inter-neuronal interactions and of the modular interaction and integration of brain regions contributing to motor activity. Two photon calcium imaging has revolutionized experimental capabilities to measure large-scale neuronal activity, but poses a significant challenge in terms of massive dynamical data analysis. We intend to confront these challenges face-on, to significantly boost the quality and relevance of experimental data collected during the process of animal learning and execution of motor functions. Our goal is to build an end-to-end modular platform to organize automatically (in a data agnostic way) the dynamical observation space into dynamic scenarios corresponding to contextual groups of neuronal dynamics and to specific motor activity in different related trials. Our plan follows a path from low-level processing of raw calcium imaging data through mid-level organization of extracted neuronal time-traces and finally to high-level inference and prediction of behavior. We aim to extend prior geometric dynamics analysis methods for nonlinear empirical modeling to the complexity of the large-scale neuronal data. Our methodology leads to the determination of low-dimensional intrinsic dynamical sub-processes that provides a coherent explanation of the observed data, and to testable experimental predictions. Unlike conventional neuronal data processing postulating a-priori specific structural models, we rely only on general data-agnostic coherence assumptions. These settings remove bias due to a- priori modeling and enable developing tools that are independent of the acquisition modality, simplifying data fusion (such as neuronal and behavioral observations). Our initial experimental setup is two photon calcium imaging measurements of a head-fixed mouse, performing a motor reach task in multiple repetitive trials. The brain imaging data is synchronized with acquired high- resolution behavioral video. As we show in this proposal, we already have preliminary results demonstrating the power of our empirical analytics methods. Project Narrative In this project, we introduce a methodology for unravelling the complexity of neuronal activity in the brain of a mouse, while performing various tasks. Our main goal is to develop and provide an end-to-end system of modular mathematical tools to automatically analyze, co-organize and model massive amounts of high- resolution spatiotemporal neuronal activity with motor functions.

"2018 Neurobiology of Cognition Gordon Research Conference and Gordon Research Seminar SUMMARY This proposal requests partial support for the fifth Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on the Neurobiology of Cognition, and for its associated Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) for trainees. The driving force behind the GRC is the rapid pace of convergent findings in molecular, cellular circuit and systems Neuroscience, augmented by technical developments in cell-targeting, imaging, computing and brain-machine interfaces. As a result, there are rapidly evolving descriptions of neuronal circuits and dynamics, neurophysiological processes and computational principles that underpin cognitive functions. The overarching goal of this GRC is to promote communication and collaboration across relevant levels of analysis and among empirical scientists, theoreticians and technical development specialists, emphasizing the most recent findings. The associated GRS, held just prior to the GRC, is designed to provide opportunities for doctoral and post-doctoral trainees to communicate their most recent findings and perspectives, and to prepare them for more in-depth participation in the parent GRC that immediately follows. Along with recent findings in traditional “core” areas such as memory and decision making, formal sessions will explore several new themes, including: 1) the evolutionary processes that have led to the human brain's cognitive abilities and 2) machine learning and its implications for cognitive neuroscience, 3) cognition in natural contexts 4) processing of sound for language, and 5) the brain as a network of interconnected areas. The program is highly interdisciplinary, bringing together behavioral, neuroimaging and electrophysiological techniques in humans and non-human animals with computational approaches that explicate empirical findings and construct realistic models to represent the developing picture of cognitive operations and guide future experimentation. The program also underscores novel, state-of-the-art experimental and theoretical approaches that promise to define fundamental principles of cognition, and to extend these to improved treatment of brain dysfunction.

"Encoding Precise Behavioral Features of Anxiety by Cortico-BNST Ensembles PROJECT SUMMARY Maladaptive behaviors are a staple of anxiety disorders, yet how specific neural populations drive these behav- iors is unclear. Despite the high prevalence of anxiety disorders and their devastating burden, truly effective therapeutics are still lacking; understanding the underlying pathophysiology is critical. This is not a trivial feat considering the multitude of regions involved and the complexity of associated behaviors. The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is one region highly implicated in governing adaptive and pathological anxiety states, and medial prefrontal cortical (mPFC) neurons are known to regulate motivated behaviors, including those re- lated to anxiety. How mPFC directly modulates BNST activity in anxiety states though is not known. Therefore, the objective of this proposal is to study how mPFC neurons that project to BNST engage in anxiety-related behaviors. Experiments will employ contemporary tools to study the precise neurocircuitry during expression of specific anxiety-related phenotypes. First, in rodent models, anxiety-related behaviors will be identified in the presence of an anxiogenic stimulus using recently developed computer vision and machine learning tools that define behaviors from subsecond modules (Aim 1.1). This is a highly quantitative approach to analyze behavior that will track commonly studied behaviors and, importantly, novel behaviors that have been overlooked in the literature. Second, the role of BNST-projecting mPFC neurons in anxiety-related behaviors will be assessed using inhibitory and excitatory optogenetics in combination with the previously described behavioral analysis (Aim 1.2). This neural population will be targeted using new viral strategies that allow for projection specific targeting. Finally, the physiological neural dynamics of these mPFC neurons during the expression of anxiety- related behaviors will be visualized using mountable, miniature microscopes in mice expressing the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6s (Aim 2). This activity will be assessed with concurrent behavioral module recording to understand the neuronal dynamics during anxiety-related behaviors. Collectively, these experiments will determine how BNST-projecting mPFC neurons govern expression of the wide gamut of anxiety-related behaviors. Further, the culmination of this study and studies across the neuroscientific community will bear a clearer understanding of how anxiety-related behaviors arise in mental illnesses and will drive development of promising therapeutics. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal is relevant to public health because understanding the neural pathways that contribute to anxiety- related behaviors will drive understanding of its etiology and development of more effective therapeutics.

"Genetic Dissection of Cortical Parvalbumin Interneuron Subtypes Abstract The inhibitory control and dynamic tuning of cortical circuits is mediated by a diversity of GABAergic cell types, but the biological basis of interneuron identity and diversity is not well understood. Here, we combine developmental genetic, anatomic and transcriptomic approaches to define and discover bona fide cell types within a broad class of cortical interneurons. Parvalbumin containing, fast-spiking basket cells (PVCs) are the largest population of interneurons in the neocortex and integrate in infragranular, granular (layer IV), and supragranular circuits, each with unique input/output connectivity. Recent findings from our laboratory and others suggest heterogeneity in PVC morphology, synaptic properties, and connectivity, but it is uncertain how many of these represent distinct subtypes. Using a developmental genetic strategy, we take advantage of the inside-out laminar specification of PVCs to identify and characterize subtypes based on lineage and birth time restricted cohorts. PVCs are derived from the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE), and the transition from progenitor to differentiated neuron is marked by the upregulation of proneural transcription factors. By intersecting inducible Ascl1-CreER and Dlx1-CreER mice with PV-Flp mice and an intersectional reporter and inducing in mid-to-late embryogenesis, we have begun parsing adult laminar PVC subtypes for multifactorial single-cell analysis. We quantify the laminar position and morphology of lineage restricted and birth-dated PVC cohorts. We will also carry out single cell RNAseq to analyze their transcription profiles. The integration of morphological and anatomical characterization with single cell RNAseq will increase our understanding of cell identity in PVCs and can potentially uncover new underlying cellular properties. Because PVCs are implicated in schizophrenia, autism, and other mental disorders, their complete profiling at the single cell level could aid in understanding pathophysiology and suggest better treatment strategies. Project Narrative Public Health Relevance: About 1 in 5 Americans are afflicted with mental health disorders such as schizophrenia, Alzheimer’s disease, and autism, placing a considerable burden on individuals and health care institutions across the country. Parvalbumin interneurons are the most prevalent inhibitory cells in the neocortex and their dysfunction implicated across many disorders, though their precise circuit integration is not well understood. This research proposal will lay the foundation for a single-cell understanding of the individual cell types that underlie this powerful “brake” mechanism and identify specific molecular targets that can hopefully lead to better therapeutic strategies.",Genetic Dissection of Cortical Parvalbumin Interneuron Subtypes,9648030,F31MH114529,"['Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic

"The cerebro-cerebellar-basal-gangliar network for visuomotor learning ABSTRACT Visual learning is critical to the lives of human and non-human primates. Visuomotor association, the assignment of an arbitrary symbol to a particular movement (like a red light to a braking movement), is a well- studied form of visual learning. This proposal tests the hypothesis that the brain accomplishes visuomotor associative learning using an anatomically defined closed-loop network, including the prefrontal cortex, the basal ganglia, and the cerebellum. In our preliminary work we have developed a task that studies how monkeys learn to associate one of two novel fractal symbols with a right hand movement, and the other symbol with a left hand movement. Every experiment begins with the monkeys responding to two overtrained symbols that they have seen hundreds of thousands of times. At an arbitrary time we change the symbols to two fractal symbols that the monkey has never seen. It takes the monkey 40 to 70 trials to learn the new associations. In our preliminary results we have discovered that Purkinje cells in the midlateral cerebellar hemisphere track the monkeys’ learning as they as they figure out the required associations. The neurons signal the result of the prior decision. Half of the neurons respond more when the prior decision was correct; the others respond more when the prior decision was wrong. The difference between the activity of these two types of neurons provides a cognitive error signal that is maximal when the monkeys are performing at a chance level, and gradually becomes not different from zero as the monkeys learn the task. The neurons do not predict the result of the impending decision. Although the neurons change their activity dramatically at the symbol switch, the kinematics of the movements do not change at all. This proposal takes this discovery as the starting point for four aims: 1) to use viral transynaptic tract tracing to discover the cortical and basal ganglia regions that project to the cerebellar visuomotor association area. 2) to record from the four nodes of the network as anatomically defined (midlateral cerebellar hemisphere, dentate nucleus, basal ganglia, prefrontal cortex), simultaneously, using multiple single neuron recordings, to see if these areas also have information about the process of visuomotor association 3) to inactivate each node, to see how their inactivation affects the monkey’s ability to learn new associations, and whether the inactivation affects the activity of the neurons at the other nodes. 4) to develop computational methods to analyze the activity of neural activity recorded simultaneously in all four nodes of the network (Aim 2) in the midlateral cerebellar cortex with regard to parameters such as prior outcome and movement, hand, symbol, and the intensity and epoch of the prior cognitive error signal. We will use dimensional reduction techniques to answer questions like whether hand or symbol can be decoded from network activity. We will model how the cerebellum simple spike cognitive error signal might propagate through the network and be used to facilitate visuomotor association learning and the processing of signals in the cerebellum, basal ganglia and cerebral cortex Project Narrative Learning that a particular object cues a particular action, as a red light makes us stop walking or brake the car, is critical for human behavior and can be degraded by human disease. This project will apply physiological, computational, and anatomical methods to investigate a brain network for visual learning. We will find the exact areas of the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum that participate in this learning, and use machine learning techniques to understand how the activity of neurons recorded simultaneously in these brain areas can facilitate learning.",The cerebro-cerebellar-basal-gangliar network for visuomotor learning,9818745,R01NS113078,"['Affect ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Association Learning ', ' Basal Ganglia ', ' Basal Nuclei ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Cerebellar Cortex ', ' Cerebellar cortex structure ', ' Cerebellum ', ' Cerebral cortex ', ' Cognition ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' associative conditioning ', ' Pavlovian conditioning ', ' Associative Learning ', ' classical conditioning ', ' Cues ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Exhibits ', ' γ-Aminobutyric Acid ', ' GABA ', ' Aminalone ', ' Aminalon ', ' 4-amino-butanoic acid ', ' 4-Aminobutyric Acid ', ' 4-Aminobutanoic Acid ', ' gamma-Aminobutyric Acid ', ' Grant ', ' Hand ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Learning ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' working memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Monkeys ', ' body movement ', ' Movement ', ' Pantherine ', ' Agarin ', ' Muscimol ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' cerebellar Purkinje cell ', "" Purkinje's Corpuscles "", ' Purkinje Cells ', ' Rabies virus ', ' psychomotor reaction time ', ' Response Time ', ' Response RT ', ' Reaction Time ', ' Reading ', ' Reflex ', ' Reflex action ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Suggestion ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' General Viruses ', ' Virus ', ' Work ', ' Walking ', ' nucleus dentatus ', ' Dentate nucleus ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' Left ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Fractals ', ' Failure ', ' Visual ', ' nonhuman primate ', ' non-human primate ', ' Agonist ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' cognitive function ', ' Dimensions ', ' Parietal ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Viral ', ' visual learning ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' kinematics ', ' kinematic model ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' Motor ', ' Cognitive ', ' Computational Technique ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' computer analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computational analyses ', ' To specify ', ' Process ', ' Outcome ', ' visual motor ', ' visuomotor ', ' human disease ', ' motor learning ', ' locomotor learning ', ' motor control ', ' signal processing ', ' cognitive process ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Injections ', ' Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network ', ' eMERGE Network ', ' eMERGE Consortium ', ' ']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,1164920,NY-13,0.005431355273041856
"Modeling and mapping multiple computational processes in human reinforcement learning Project Summary Learning from rewards is one of the fundamental roles of the nervous system, allowing for beneficial behaviors to be repeated, and detrimental behaviors to be avoided. It has recently become clear that when humans learn from rewards in the environment, they rely on multiple neural systems that work in tandem. What are the psychological and biological constraints of these systems, and how do they interact during learning? The proposed experiments are designed to answer these questions by developing precise computational models of human instrumental learning, as well as investigating the neural dynamics of, and interactions between, individual learning processes. Aim 1 will focus on isolating individual learning processes, further developing a novel model of human instrumental learning that highlights contributions to learning from both a flexible executive working memory module and an incremental reinforcement learning module. Behavioral experiments and computational modeling will be used to better characterize these two learning processes, with a focus on how they interact instantaneously and over time. Aim 2 will use a combination of brain stimulation and neuroimaging to better characterize the neural systems supporting each learning process, as well as the putative interactions between these neural circuits. These results will constrain our understanding of the neural mechanisms that drive human instrumental learning. The knowledge gained by this project will provide a vital framework for clinical applications, for instance, in understanding and treating working memory related learning deficits in schizophrenia, and reinforcement learning deficits in Parkinson's disease. Critically, a more precise model of individual learning processes could guide the development of clinical protocols that leverage intact learning systems when other learning systems are compromised. Finally, an enhanced understanding of human reward-based learning could improve theories of habit formation, which may further inform psychological and neurophysiological models of addiction. Project Narrative This project will examine how multiple learning systems (e.g. working memory, incremental reinforcement learning) guide human instrumental learning, model these multiple learning systems computationally, and investigate their respective underlying neural mechanisms. The results will be useful not only for a better scientific understanding of learning deficits in psychological disorders like schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease, but also for developing improved clinical protocols for leveraging intact neural circuits when others are compromised. Furthermore, an improved description of human reward-based learning will be relevant to understanding how habits are formed and reinforced, which may inform our understanding of the acquisition of addictive behaviors.",Modeling and mapping multiple computational processes in human reinforcement learning,9761233,F32MH119797,"['Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Basal Ganglia ', ' Basal Nuclei ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Choice Behavior ', ' Clinical Protocols ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' instrumental conditioning ', ' Instrumental Learning ', ' Operant Conditioning ', ' Hydroxytyramine ', ' Dopamine ', ' Environment ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Habits ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Learning ', ' working memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Study models ', ' Neurologic Organ System ', ' Neurologic Body System ', ' Nervous System ', ' Nervous system structure ', ' neurophysiological ', ' neurophysiology ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Parkinsons disease ', "" Parkinson's disease "", "" Parkinson's "", ' Parkinson ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Play ', ' Psychology ', ' psychophysical ', ' Psychophysics ', ' psychomotor reaction time ', ' Response Time ', ' Response RT ', ' Reaction Time ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Research ', ' Rewards ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Addictive Behavior ', ' Mediating ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Series ', ' Individual ', ' Exposure to ', ' Attenuated ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Knowledge ', ' Event ', ' Scanning ', ' Parietal ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Response to stimulus physiology ', ' stimulus/response ', ' visual stimulus ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Categories ', ' Support System ', ' Social Support System ', ' neural circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' visual motor ', ' visuomotor ', ' Mind ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' Learning Module ', ' Teaching Module ', ' Educational Module ', ' Education Module ', ' cognitive process ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' clinical development ', ' recruit ', ' human model ', ' learning algorithm ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,F32,2019,60854,CA-13,-0.045264112998308806
"Transcriptome-based systematic discovery of GABAergic neurons in the neocortex ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The integrated sensory, motor, and cognitive abilities that guide adaptive behavior in mammals emerge from neural circuit operations in the neocortex. Understanding the organization of cortical circuits requires comprehensive knowledge of the basic cellular components. The neocortex consists of approximately 80% glutamatergic pyramidal neurons and 20% GABAergic neurons. Although a minority, GABA interneurons are exceptionally diverse, and this diversity may be crucial in regulating the balance and functional operations of cortical circuits. However, systematic identification, enumeration and classification of GABAergic neurons have been a challenging goal. We hypothesize that distinct transcription programs underlie GABA prototype identity and diversity as defined by their position, morphology and basic innervation pattern. Thus we suggest that transcription profiling provides a fundamental starting point and efficient strategy for cell type discovery. Here we propose a multi-faceted approach that integrates genetic targeting, single cell transcriptomics, statistical and computational analysis, morpho-physiological studies to systematically identify and classify GABAergic neurons. We focus on GABA neurons derived from the embryonic medial ganglionic eminence (MGE), which constitute two-third of cortical interneurons, and for which we have built effective genetic tools. We have established a robust single cell RNAseq (scRNAseq) method that allows high resolution transcriptome profiling through single mRNA counting using nucleotide barcodes. We will take a two-step ""Targeted-Saturation"" cell screen approach toward systematic discovery of cortical GABA neurons. First, we will apply scRNAseq to a set of GABA subpopulations, captured by intersectional genetic targeting, and discover their distinct transcription signatures. With these phenotype- characterized populations, we hone our statistical analysis to distinguish biological signal vs experimental noise and artifacts, and shape our computation algorithm based on biological ground truth. Thus in contrast to a unsupervised clustering approach to transcriptome analysis, we incorporate extensive empirical information that enable a biology-motivated supervised approach, where well-delineated phenotypes play the key role of training the algorithm and classifier. Second, we will apply scRNASeq to increasingly broader genetic-defined populations of MGE-derived GABA neurons in the primary motor cortex. We will discover transcriptome-predicted cell types and build 2nd round driver lines that target and validate a subset of novel cell types.

"Reverse Engineering the Brain Stem Circuits that Govern Exploratory Behavior Overview - Abstract  Brainstem function is necessary for life-sustaining functions such as breathing and for survival functions, such as foraging for food. Individual motor actions are activated by specific brainstem cranial motor nuclei. The specificity of individual motor actions reflects the participation of motor nuclei in circuits within closed loops between sensors and muscle actuators. However, these loops are also nested and connect to feedback and feedforward pathways, which underlie coordination between orofacial motor actions. A key question for this proposal is how different actions are coordinated to form a rich repertoire of behaviors, such as rhythmic motions linked to breathing, and the orchestrated displacements of the head, nose, tongue, and vibrissae during exploration. We postulate that the best candidate interface for orofacial motor coordination are premotor and pre2motor neuron populations in the brainstem reticular formation: these neurons project to cranial motor nuclei, receive descending inputs from outside of the brainstem, and interconnected to each other.  Our approach exploits and expands upon a broad spectrum of innovative experimental tools. These include state-of-the-art behavioral methods to study motor actions and their coordination into behaviors. From an experimental perspective, the underlying neuronal circuitry for each orofacial motor action may be accessed via transsynaptic transport starting at the muscle activators or associated sensors in the periphery. These studies will make use of molecular, genetic, and functional labeling methods to enable cell phenotyping and circuit tracing. These data will establish the ""Components"", i.e., brainstem nuclei connectivity for all Research Projects. These studies are complemented by in vivo electrophysiology and optogenetics in order measure and perturb the signal flow during exploration and decision-making: these studies will establish orofacial “Wiring Diagrams”. The sum of these techniques will permit us to elucidate the functions of intrinsic brainstem circuits and their modulation by descending pathways.  Our data will be integrated in two ways. First we will begin development of computational models of the dynamics of active sensing by the orofacial motor plant and brainstem circuits. These will initially focus on the vibrissa system, starting with characterizations of mechanics and mechano-neuronal transformations of vibrissa movement and extending to exploration of brainstem circuits that drive vibrissa set-point and rhythmic whisking. Finally, vibrissa feedforward pathways will be computationally modeled to explore how sensory input affects vibrissa dynamics. Second, to record connectivity data that arises from our experimental tracing studies, we will construct an Trainable Texture-based Digital Atlas that utilizes machine learning to automate anatomical annotation of brainstem nuclei. The Atlas is designed to allow accurate 3D alignment of labeled neurons, even when labeled neurons reside in small sub-regions outside of well-defined brainstem nuclei, based on triangulation to Atlas landmark structures. Further, digitization of serially sectioned brain data sets allows 3D reconstruction and alignment of small brainstem subregions as well as the collation of this data from different brains into the same Atlas.  Our proposed program on brainstem circuitry and dynamics will yield general lessons about the nature of neuronal computation. The analytic and anatomical tools developed for these studies will be made available through our data science core to the larger neuroscience community. Narrative Reverse engineering the brain stem circuits that govern exploratory behavior Neuronal circuits in the brainstem control life-sustaining functions, including breathing and orofacial motor actions that underlie exploration, that must be performed without interruption from the moment of birth. We will use and advance the tools of modern neuroscience to add informative labels to individual neurons in the brainstem, place these cells within circuits, connect circuits with motor actions, and coordinate different actions into behaviors. Our procedures, analysis, and modeling will mitigate many of the challenges that have limited our ability to discern the structure and function of brainstem circuits in normal and diseased states.",Reverse Engineering the Brain Stem Circuits that Govern Exploratory Behavior,9775220,U19NS107466,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Breathing ', ' inspiration ', ' Respiratory Inspiration ', ' Respiratory Aspiration ', ' Atlases ', ' Behavior ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain Stem ', ' Brainstem ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Communities ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Decision Making ', ' Dedications ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Engineering ', ' Exploratory Behavior ', ' Feedback ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Goals ', ' Head ', ' Histology ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Joints ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Literature ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Motion ', ' body movement ', ' Movement ', ' muscular ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' Muscle ', ' Neuroanatomies ', ' Neuranatomy ', ' Neuranatomies ', ' Neuroanatomy ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Respiratory System, Nose, Nasal Passages ', ' Nasal Passages Nose ', ' Nasal ', ' Nose ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Periodicity ', ' Phenotype ', ' Plants ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Reticular Formation ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodent ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Schools ', ' Sensation ', ' Esthesia ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Specificity ', ' Tongue ', ' Whiskers ', ' Vibrissae ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Molecular Genetics ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' sensor ', ' Procedures ', ' Cephalic ', ' Cranial ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Mechanics ', ' mechanical ', ' Sensory ', ' Texture ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' 3D ', ' 3-D ', ' neuron component ', ' physical model ', ' neuronal circuitry ', ' neuronal circuit ', ' Structure ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Data ', ' Interruption ', ' Motor ', ' Sum ', ' in vivo ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' active control ', ' Output ', ' orofacial ', ' feeding ', ' reconstruction ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Motor output ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' platform-independent ', ' motor control ', ' optogenetics ', ' sensory input ', ' control theory ', ' Data Science ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' ']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U19,2019,2994145,CA-52,-0.12486356156254463
"Uncovering Population-Level Cellular Relationships to Behavior via Mesoscale Networks Project Summary/Abstract: There is significant current interest in understanding how neurons relate to whole-brain networks and how these networks coordinate to give rise to behavior. We have recently shown that we can decompose Local Field Potential voltage signals recorded from depth electrodes implanted in multiple brain regions into “electrical functional connectomes,” or electomes, which empirically are consistent between individuals in a population and are predictive of behavior. This provides a unique opportunity to use these consistent network properties to anchor and stratify neurons based on their relationship to whole-brain network dynamics, and this approach only uses data that is currently collected or could be collected with minor changes in protocol. This stratification will be consistent across animals, allowing examination of how neurons in different brains relate to whole-brain networks and to behaviors. This will facilitate closer examination of neuron activity by allowing stronger data aggregation across subjects. Neural encoding and decoding models will be required to be faithful at both the individual neuron level and the multi-region voltage dynamic level, constraining neural relationships by known and learned biological properties. This will be accomplished by first building upon our explainable machine learning approach for learning multi-region networks by including historical data to improve the utility of machine learning during pilot studies and creating novel stochastic optimization approaches for real-time mapping of observed data into the networks. Then, we will develop a model capable of embedding neurons into a shared space, where the embedding succinctly reveals how a neuron relates to the electomes. Finally, these vector embeddings will be used to relate neurons to both behavior and the multi-region dynamics in both single-trial and repeated-trial behavioral tasks. Remarkably, a neuron’s embedding and the state of the mesoscale networks can predict the neural encoding a priori to observing behavior and neural firing simultaneously in a new subject. The overarching goal of this proposal is to learn how neurons’ action potentials, long considered to be a fundamental unit of information, relate to whole-brain spatiotemporal voltage patterns and behavior. To uncover this relationship, we will develop novel computational methods capable of learning networks that relate voltage signals from multiple brain regions based upon our previously developed explainable machine learning approach. These networks will then be used to stratify neurons into subtypes consistent across a population of subjects to facilitate the statistical aggregation of data to uncover relationships between multiple scale of neural activity and behavior.",Uncovering Population-Level Cellular Relationships to Behavior via Mesoscale Networks,9775689,R01EB026937,"['Action Potentials ', ' Animals ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' Aggregated Data ', ' Data Aggregation ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Electrodes ', ' Implanted Electrodes ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Feedback ', ' Goals ', ' Learning ', ' Maps ', ' Minor ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Statistical Models ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' Neurosciences ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Research ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Software Tools ', ' statistics ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Dimensions ', ' Frequencies ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' field study ', ' field test ', ' field learning ', ' field based data ', ' voltage ', ' Biological Neural Networks ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' theories ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Stratification ', ' Sum ', ' Rodent Model ', ' Validation ', ' Behavioral ', ' vector ', ' Behavioral Paradigm ', ' Population ', ' analytical tool ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' optogenetics ', ' Behavioral trial ', ' BRAIN initiative ', ' learning network ', ' Formulation ', ' connectome ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' ']",NIBIB,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,1055855,NC-04,0.07827696657487677
"Dissecting and modifying temporal dynamics underlying major depressive disorder Title: Dissecting and modifying temporal dynamics underlying major depressive disorder Multiple human imaging studies have described aberrant spatiotemporal dynamics in specific brain networks across subjects with major depressive disorder. Furthermore, rodent studies have identified dysfunctional synchrony across cortical limbic circuits in genetic and stress- induced models of major depressive disorder. Nevertheless, it remains to be clarified whether these observed changes in neural dynamics play a causal role or simply reflect (i.e., correlate with) the behavioral-state observed in major depressive disorder. Several major challenges to addressing this question exist. 1) The brain synchronizes dynamics across multiple timescales. Rodent studies classically monitor dynamics at the millisecond time scale (reflecting circuits), and human studies typically monitor brain dynamics at the seconds time scale (reflect circuit and network level activity). 2) Rodent studies are generally limited in their ability to monitor large-scale activity from many brain regions concurrently, while human imaging studies observe activity across the whole brain. 3) To our knowledge, few approaches/models integrate changes in cell-type specific gene expression implicated in depression to changes in circuit and network- specific brain dynamics. 4) Techniques which directly manipulate brain dynamics (neural synchrony and cross-frequency coupling) have yet to be largely implemented throughout the rodent research community. To address these challenges, we propose to perform multi-circuit in vivo neural recordings in the two widely used rodent models of depression. We will then utilize machine learning to determine the spatiotemporal dynamic alterations that are shared between the two models. Next, we will test whether cellular molecular manipulations implicated in major depressive disorder are sufficient to induce the same spatiotemporal dynamic alterations. Finally, we will verify that these spatiotemporal dynamics are causal by directly inducing and suppressing them and measuring their impact on behavior. This strategy will yield an unprecedented understanding of how altered dynamics within specific brain circuits contribute to depression. Many cortical and limbic brain regions including prefrontal cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, and thalamus work together to coordinate emotional, social and cognitive function in health and disease. In this study, we will discover the network-level mechanisms whereby fast interactions between these brain regions become altered in major depressive disorder. The discovery and validation of this ‘depression brain-state’ may facilitate the development of new therapeutics that ameliorate depression by directly modulating altered neural dynamics in the brain.",Dissecting and modifying temporal dynamics underlying major depressive disorder,9800892,R01MH120158,"['Amygdaloid structure ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdala ', ' Antidepressive Agents ', ' anti-depressive agents ', ' anti-depressants ', ' anti-depressant drugs ', ' anti-depressant agent ', ' Antidepressants ', ' Antidepressant Drugs ', ' Antidepressant Agent ', ' Anxiety ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Cognition ', ' Communities ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Emotions ', ' Exhibits ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Health ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hippocampus ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' Nucleus Accumbens ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodent ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' sociobehavior ', ' Social Behavior ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' thalamic ', ' Thalamus ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Mediating ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' Ventral Tegmental Area ', ' ventral tegmentum ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Chronic ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Functional disorder ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Behavior Control ', ' behavioral control ', ' Behavioral Manipulation ', ' cognitive function ', ' millisecond ', ' Msec ', ' Frequencies ', ' cell type ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' Viral ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' novel ', ' Disease model ', ' disorder model ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' major depression disorder ', ' major depression ', ' clinical depression ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' Brain region ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' autistic spectrum disorder ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' Infantile Autism ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Autism ', ' Data ', ' Pre-Clinical Model ', ' Preclinical Models ', ' in vivo ', ' Cognitive ', ' Collection ', ' Rodent Model ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' preclinical study ', ' pre-clinical study ', ' Social Functioning ', ' Outcome ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' Coupling ', ' Impairment ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' reward processing ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new drugs ', ' new drug treatments ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' network models ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' optogenetics ', ' depression model ', ' depressive model ', ' human imaging ', ' imaging study ', ' social defeat ', ' ']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,716265,NC-04,-0.10016699924811241
"Exocytosis fuels plasma membrane expansion in developing neurons Project Summary During development, neurons acquire a polarized, elongated, and complex morphology, which requires a significant expansion of plasma membrane surface area. Surface increases have been estimated to reach upward of 20% per day, which far exceeds concomitant neuronal volume increases. We previously demonstrated that SNARE-mediated exocytosis is required during neuritogenesis and axon branching, presumably to provide membrane material to the expanding plasma membrane, which can only stretch ~2-3% prior to rupture. Asymmetric exocytosis has also been implicated in the attractive axonal turning responses that are critical for axon guidance. Achieving proper neuronal morphogenesis and connectivity is central to the formation of a functional nervous system. Together these factors underscore the significance of regulated exocytosis in developing neurons, even prior to synaptogenesis. Over the last 40 years, a multitude of components involved in exocytosis have been identified, although this list is not exhaustive. Further, mechanisms that regulate the mode, progression, frequency, or spatiotemporal organization of vesicle fusion with the membrane, all of which are poised to modulate neuronal morphogenesis, have not been defined. To visualize exocytic events in developing neurons, we express a pH-sensitive variant of GFP (pHluorin) attached to the lumenal side of a v-SNARE, such as VAMP2 or VAMP7, to illuminate the occurrence of fusion pore opening between the acidic vesicular lumen and the neutral extracellular space. Analysis of such images has remained a time-intensive, non-automated bottleneck, delaying understanding of this fundamental cellular behavior. We developed a fully-automated computer- vision software for the detection and analysis of VAMP-pHluorin mediated exocytic events that will quantitatively reveal the spatial and temporal organization and regulation of exocytosis in developing neurons at a level of detail previously unattainable. We exploit this innovative methodology along with unbiased proteomics, microfluidics, biochemical and cell biological approaches to investigate the relationship between exocytosis and neuronal morphogenesis and identifying the molecular mechanisms that regulate exocytosis in developing neurons. PROJECT NARRATIVE During development, neurons acquire a highly elongated, polarized and complex cell shape that requires a dramatic expansion of the neuronal surface area or plasma membrane, which is hypothesized to be fueled by vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane.

"Emergence of Functional Network Dynamics from Single Cell Properties Project Summary/Abstract The collective dynamics of the network of neurons in the brain drive its primary holistic function — control of organismal behavior. Pathologies of the nervous system that disrupt this coordinated activity result in dysfunctional patterns of motor output and gross behavior. However, it is unknown how patterns of coordinated activity arise from the properties of single neurons and their connections. In the next five years we seek to develop a rigorous theory and biologically realistic model of the emergence of coordinated dynamics in a complete network of neurons, similar to the current level of understanding of how the dynamics of interacting molecular species produce goal-directed motile behavior in single-cell bacteria. We focus on the relatively simple nervous system of C. elegans; with precisely 302 neurons, it is a natural choice for such fundamental neurodynamical studies. To attack this problem, the research in our lab utilizes a fusion of experimental and computational approaches including advanced microscopy, genomic engineering, machine learning based image processing, quantitative behavior, and dynamical systems analysis. We have developed novel approaches to quantitatively probe and characterize the signal processing properties of single neurons as well as record and quantify the activity of the entire C. elegans nervous system at single-cell resolution using volumetric calcium imaging under genetic perturbation. We are now exploring the relationship between the microscopic properties of cellular signaling and the macroscopic function of collective network dynamics. A mechanistic model of the composition and maintenance of structured, controlled brain dynamics would provide a framework for understanding how gross neurological disease states arise from cellular and molecular dysfunction. Project Narrative A basic theory and data driven model of the emergence of collective, coordinated network dynamics based on the properties of neurons is lacking.

"CRCNS: Closed-Loop Computational Neuroscience for Causally Dissecting Circuits Despite substantial progress characterizing neural responses, it is particularly challenging to determine  causal interactions within recurrently connected circuits due to the confounding influence of the  interconnections. This proposed project pioneers a nascent field of closed-loop computational neuroscience that enables real-time feedback stimulation during experiments to decouple recurrently connected elements and make stronger causal inferences about their interactions. Specifically, the  contributions of this project will include: Aim 1) Using modern unsupervised machine learning methods to fit latent state dynamical system models of population responses under closed-loop stimulation. The  developed techniques will be used to clamp firing rate in genetically targeted inhibitory interneurons  across S 1 cortical laminae in the mouse to map the causal effect of inhibitory cells on the sensory gain in  excitatory cells. Aim 2) Merging and extending tools from network feedback control and causal inference  to identify functional connections between network nodes using realistic experimental constraints. These  techniques will be used to clamp firing rate in different S1 laminae of the mouse, using distributed  perturbations to identify the functional connectivity between microcircuit layers during sensory stimulation.  Aim 3) Developing a large-scale computational modeling environment to serve as an in si\ico testbed for the community.  Significance: The proposed project changes the de facto standard use of stimulation in experiments to  leverage the full power of new recording and s.timulation technology for decoupling recurrently connected  variables and making stronger causal inferences.  Broader impacts: While the project uses rodent somatosensation as a model system, the results of this  project will provide new techniques to study neurologic disorders involving disfunction of recurrent circuits  (e.g., epilepsy, Parkinson's disease and depression). The open-source implementations will constitute  critical algorithmic infrastructure for closed-loop stimulation experiments. This project will also result in the  production of new trainees in an emerging new interdisciplinary field of closed-loop computational neuroscience. RELEVANCE (See instructions):  The neural circuits that fail in many neurologic disorders (e.g., epilepsy, Parkinson's disease and  depression) are difficult to study because they involve complex feedback loops.

"Mozak: Creating an Expert Community to accelerate neuronal reconstruction at scale Project Summary This project aims to leverage the best of both computational and human expertise in neuronal reconstruction towards the goal of accelerating global neuroscience discovery from internationally-sourced imaging data. We propose to create a cloud-based unified platform for converging 3-dimensional images of neurons onto a single analysis platform to (1) train and grow a new expert community of global reconstructors to work across the data from these groups, to (2) generate a community-sourced neuronal reconstruction database of open imaging data that can be incorporated into a 3-dimensional map of neuronal interconnectivity - onto which (3) novel annotations and more complex functional and molecular data can be overlaid. Our approach will evolve with the growing needs of the neuroscience community over time. To do this, in Aim One (Neuronal Reconstruction at Scale), we will test if the newly developed crowd-sourced game-based platform Mozak can develop a collective of new human experts at scale, capable of accelerating the rate of current reconstruction by at least an order of magnitude, at the same time as increasing the robustness, quality and unbiasedness of the final reconstructions. In Aim Two (Robust Multi-Purpose Annotation), we will enhance basic neuronal reconstruction by adding specific semantic annotation— including soma volume and morphological quantification, volumetric analysis, and ongoing features (e.g. dendritic spines, axonal varicosities) requested from the neuroscience community. Experienced and high-ranking members will be given the opportunity to advance through increasingly complex neurons into full arbor brain-wide neuronal projections and multiple clustered groups of neurons in localized circuits. Finally, in Aim 3 (Creation of a Research-Adaptive Data Repository), we aim to develop a database of neuronal images reconstructed using the Mozak interface that will directly serve the general and specific needs of different research groups. Our goal is to make this database dynamically adaptive — as new research questions will invariably bring new needs for additional annotations and cross-referencing with other data modalities. This highquality unbiased processing repository will also be perfectly suited for training sets for automated algorithms, and the generation of a 3-dimensional maps such as Allen Institute for Brain Science (AIBS) common coordinate framework. We expect that the computational reconstruction methods will further improve with the new large corpus of “gold standard” reconstructions. Collectively, the completion of these three aims will create an analysis suite as well as an online community of experts capable of performing in depth analysis of large-scale datasets that will significantly accelerate neuroscience research, enhance machine learning for reconstruction analysis, and create a common platform of baseline neuronal morphology data against which aberrantly functioning neurons can be analyzed. Project Narrative  This project will create a new central nexus point for neuronal reconstruction and semantic annotation (Mozak) that can be used by all research labs via an accessible online portal. We will develop a new cadre of neuronal reconstruction experts that will— in conjunction with automated tools that are enhanced by their work — drastically increase the volume, quality and robustness of neuron reconstructions and annotations. Mozak reconstructions will be shared with existing repositories and will be continually updated and re-annotated based on emerging needs of research - ensuring perpetual relevance, and allowing us to generate a platform to establish the range of “baseline” 3-dimensional readouts of neuronal morphology against which diseased or malfunctioning neurons can be analyzed and understood. 1",Mozak: Creating an Expert Community to accelerate neuronal reconstruction at scale,9775212,R01MH116247,"['Algorithms ', ' Axon ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Sources ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Institutes ', ' Laboratories ', ' Manuals ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Research ', ' Science ', ' Semantics ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Varicose Veins ', ' Varices ', ' Varicosity ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Gap Junctions ', ' Nexus Junction ', ' Nexus ', ' Low-resistance Junction ', ' Communicating Junction ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Morphology ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' 3D ', ' 3-D ', ' experience ', ' neuronal cell body ', ' soma ', ' neural cell body ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Modality ', ' repository ', ' Dendritic Spines ', ' dendrite spine ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Neurosciences Research ', ' Slice ', ' Update ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' reconstruction ', ' Three-dimensional analysis ', ' 3D analysis ', ' 3-dimensional analysis ', ' 3-D analysis ', ' Outcome ', ' Imaging technology ', ' two-dimensional ', ' 2-dimensional ', ' cloud based ', ' citizen science ', ' scientific citizenship ', ' crowd-sourced science ', ' crowd science ', ' civic science ', ' citizen scientists ', ' amateur scientists ', ' amateur science ', ' crowdsourcing ', ' crowdsource ', ' crowd-sourcing ', ' crowd source ', ' online community ', ' virtual community ', ' on-line community ', ' petabyte ', ' data warehouse ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Banks ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2019,628430,WA-07,0.010326571411315367
"Data-driven analysis for neuronal dynamic modeling Project Summary / Abstract Our main goal is to unravel communication dynamics in the brain, as they relate to various sensory-motor actions and to the learning process. The sensory-motor system operates through the concerted interaction of multiple closed-loops feedback systems. While some broad level knowledge is available about single neuron properties and general high-level operations, we lack understanding of functional aspects of neural dynamics, of inter-neuronal interactions and of the modular interaction and integration of brain regions contributing to motor activity. Two photon calcium imaging has revolutionized experimental capabilities to measure large-scale neuronal activity, but poses a significant challenge in terms of massive dynamical data analysis. We intend to confront these challenges face-on, to significantly boost the quality and relevance of experimental data collected during the process of animal learning and execution of motor functions. Our goal is to build an end-to-end modular platform to organize automatically (in a data agnostic way) the dynamical observation space into dynamic scenarios corresponding to contextual groups of neuronal dynamics and to specific motor activity in different related trials. Our plan follows a path from low-level processing of raw calcium imaging data through mid-level organization of extracted neuronal time-traces and finally to high-level inference and prediction of behavior. We aim to extend prior geometric dynamics analysis methods for nonlinear empirical modeling to the complexity of the large-scale neuronal data. Our methodology leads to the determination of low-dimensional intrinsic dynamical sub-processes that provides a coherent explanation of the observed data, and to testable experimental predictions. Unlike conventional neuronal data processing postulating a-priori specific structural models, we rely only on general data-agnostic coherence assumptions. These settings remove bias due to a- priori modeling and enable developing tools that are independent of the acquisition modality, simplifying data fusion (such as neuronal and behavioral observations). Our initial experimental setup is two photon calcium imaging measurements of a head-fixed mouse, performing a motor reach task in multiple repetitive trials. The brain imaging data is synchronized with acquired high- resolution behavioral video. As we show in this proposal, we already have preliminary results demonstrating the power of our empirical analytics methods. Project Narrative In this project, we introduce a methodology for unravelling the complexity of neuronal activity in the brain of a mouse, while performing various tasks. Our main goal is to develop and provide an end-to-end system of modular mathematical tools to automatically analyze, co-organize and model massive amounts of high- resolution spatiotemporal neuronal activity with motor functions.

"Mechanisms of Active Sensing in Drosophila The goal of this project is to study the cellular basis of active sensation. A crucial function of all nervous systems is to distinguish between sensory stimuli originating from the external world and that generated by our own movements. This task relies on brain circuits that integrate sensory information with an internal model, or expectation, of self-generated movements. The complexity and intractability of many models used to study active sensing means that translating insights from these studies to failures of normal nervous system function remains challenging. Fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) actively move their antennae, and my recent work has elucidated a neural circuit that processes mechanosensory information from the antenna. Given the power of Drosophila as a genetic model organism, this project aims to develop the neural circuits controlling and sensing antennal movement as a cellular model for studying principles of active sensing. In the K99 (mentored) portion of this grant, I will identify the cellular location at which self- versus externally-generated mechanosensory signals become differentially represented in the brain. I will make electrophysiological recordings of intracellular activity from 2nd and 3rd order mechanosensory neurons and compare how these two populations encode passive and active movements of the antennae. I will distinguish between these two types of movements using machine learning analysis of simultaneously recorded video data. For the R00 (independent) phase, I will use optogenetics and immunohistochemistry to identify motor neurons that control antennal movement. I will then ask where input from motor neurons impinge on the sensory circuit. Finally, I will test the role of active antennal movements in behavior. By perturbing active antennal movements in freely walking and flying flies, I will directly test how these movements enable different behavioral tasks such as wind orientation and obstacle avoidance. Together, these experiments will identify the cellular basis for active sensing in Drosophila, and their role in goal- oriented behaviors. The goal of the proposed research is to understand the principles that permit nervous systems to distinguish external from internally-generated sensory stimuli. Here I propose to develop a small circuit model of this process using the antennal mechanosensory system of the fruit fly. The insights gained from a tractable genetic circuit model will enable us to understand how these mechanisms fail in disease, supporting the BRAIN Initiative’s mission to understand the neural circuit basis of a critical brain function.",Mechanisms of Active Sensing in Drosophila,9871513,K99NS114179,"['Animals ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' fruit fly ', ' Drosophila ', ' Drosophila genus ', ' Drosophila melanogaster ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Fingers ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Hand ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Immunohistochemistry Staining Method ', ' Immunohistochemistry Cell/Tissue ', ' Immunohistochemistry ', ' Insects Invertebrates ', ' Insects ', ' Insecta ', ' Learning ', ' Mechanoreceptors ', ' Mentors ', ' Mission ', ' Study models ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Biological Models ', ' Genetic Models ', ' motoneuron ', ' Motor Cell ', ' Motor Neurons ', ' body movement ', ' Movement ', ' muscular ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' Muscle ', ' Neurologic Organ System ', ' Neurologic Body System ', ' Nervous System ', ' Nervous system structure ', ' nervous system function ', ' Neurological function ', ' Neurologic function ', ' Nervous System Physiology ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' Sensory Neurons ', ' Sensory Cell Afferent Neuron ', ' Afferent Neurons ', ' Nerve Transmitter Substances ', ' Neurotransmitters ', ' Odors ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Sensation ', ' Esthesia ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Staining method ', ' Stains ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Wind ', ' Environmental Wind ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Walking ', ' Mediating ', ' goal oriented behavior ', ' Label ', ' sensor ', ' Phase ', ' Failure ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Genetic ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Sensory ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Closure by clamp ', ' Clampings ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' Flying body movement ', ' flying ', ' Speed ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' sensory stimulus ', ' physicochemical phenomena related to the senses ', ' perceptual stimulus ', ' Touch sensation ', ' tactile sensation ', ' Touch ', ' neural circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' autistic spectrum disorder ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' Infantile Autism ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Autism ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Resolution ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' fly ', ' Flies ', ' Population ', ' Cell model ', ' Cellular model ', ' optogenetics ', ' BRAIN initiative ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' ']",NINDS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,K99,2019,134007,NY-12,-0.15676230489441006
"Decoding Early Signs of Alzheimer's Disease in The Lateral Entorhinal Cortex Using Machine Learning The lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) is one of the first regions in the brain to be affected in Alzheimer’s disease, and is important for object recognition, odor discrimination and episodic memory. Hence, early AD symptoms such as misplacing objects, forgetting events and loss of smell could be due to LEC dysfunction. In order to understand how Aβ and tau accumulation impacts the LEC neurons, we will use two mouse models of AD: APP knockin (APP-KI) mice- expressing physiological levels of APP and EC- APP/Tau mice- expressing elevated levels of APP and tau in the EC. Both mouse models show selectively vulnerability in the LEC, making them ideal candidates to probe LEC function. Our preliminary data shows behavioral impairment in the EC-APP/Tau mice at 24 months and data on APP-KI show impairment at 18 months. In the proposal we will evaluate LEC function in the younger mice in order to detect neuronal changes prior to behavioral deficits. We will record LEC activity with silicon probes and test responses towards objects, odors and passage of time. Using computational approach such as machine learning, we will determine if ensemble properties of LEC neurons are affected by tau and Aβ. We hypothesize that APP in the LEC of APP-KI mice will make the neurons dysfunctional which will be evident with poor decoding accuracy for objects, odors and temporal epochs. In the EC-APP/Tau mice, combined effect of Aβ and tau will make the dysfunction worse and affect the decoding accuracy further allowing better prediction of early symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease. The proposal brings together diverse fields (electrophysiology, pathology and computational neuroscience) applying large-scale recording techniques to record ensemble populations of neurons and develop analytical and predictive computational tests to interrogate function in a vulnerable brain region that is dysfunctional in Alzheimer’s disease. Inability to smell odors, misplacing items and confusion with events are some of the earliest symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease and pathology in the lateral entorhinal cortex of the brain could be the major cause for these early symptoms. By using sophisticated electrophysiological techniques and computational analysis, we will investigate the neurons of the lateral entorhinal cortex in Alzheimer’s disease mice and predict disease onset before cognitive symptoms appear.",Decoding Early Signs of Alzheimer's Disease in The Lateral Entorhinal Cortex Using Machine Learning,9891510,R21AG066168,"['Affect ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Animals ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Mental Confusion ', ' Confusional State ', ' Confusion ', ' Cues ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' EEG ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Environment ', ' fire ', ' Fires ', ' Fire -

"Software for Automated Reconstruction of Structure & Dynamics of Neural Circuits ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our understanding of brain functions is hindered by the lack of detailed knowledge of synaptic connectivity in the underlying neural network. While synaptic connectivity of small neural circuits can be determined with electron microscopy, studies of connectivity on a larger scale, e.g. whole mouse brain, must be based on light microscopy imaging. It is now possible to fluorescently label subsets of neurons in vivo and image their axonal and dendritic arbors in 3D from multiple brain tissue sections. The overwhelming remaining challenge is neurite tracing, which must be done automatically due to the high-throughput nature of the problem. Currently, there are no automated tools that have the capacity to perform tracing tasks on the scale of mammalian neural circuits. Needless to say, the existence of such a tool is critical both for basic mapping of synaptic connectivity in normal brains, as well as for describing the changes in the nervous system which underlie neurological disorders. With this proposal we plan to continue the development of Neural Circuit Tracer - software for accurate, automated reconstruction of the structure and dynamics of neurites from 3D light microscopy stacks of images. Our goal is to revolutionize the existing functionalities of the software, making it possible to: (i) automatically reconstruct axonal and dendritic arbors of sparsely labeled populations of neurons from multiple stacks of images and (ii) automatically track and quantify changes in the structures of presynaptic boutons and dendritic spines imaged over time. We propose to utilize the latest machine learning and image processing techniques to develop multi-stack tracing, feature detection, and computer-guided trace editing capabilities of the software. All tools and datasets created as part of this proposal will be made available to the research community. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: At present, accurate methods of analysis of neuron morphology and synaptic connectivity rely on manual or semi-automated tracing tools.

"CRCNS: Network mechanisms of the learning and encoding of timed motor responses The brain is an inherently dynamic system, it evolved under strong selective pressures to allow animals to interact with the environment in real-time, and predict and prepare for future events. For these reasons, understanding neural dynamics, and how the brain tells and encodes time is fundamental to understanding brain function. The importance of neural dynamics and timing to brain function emphasizes the need for techniques that allow for the collection and analysis of massively parallel single neuron recordings across multiple structures in behaving animals. This project will combine novel electrophysiological, behavioral, analytical and computational methods to reverse engineer the neural circuits underlying learning and timing. The first aim is to combine large-scale neural recordings with computational approaches to determine how time is represented in the striatum and prefrontal cortex, two interacting brain areas that are closely implicated in temporal processing. We will specifically examine whether encoding of time relies on absolute, relative, or stimulus-specific coding mechanisms. Recordings will be carried out in awake, head-fixed mice trained on a classical trace reward conditioning task in which two cues predict reward with a different delay period. When animals learn the cue-reward association, they engage in robust anticipatory licking that precedes the reward presentation; moreover, the timing of this behavior is dependent on the cue-reward delay time. The second aim is to combine electrophysiology and optogenetics to determine if temporal coding in the striatum and prefrontal cortex is perturbed by transiently disrupting network activity. The hypothesis is that if dynamics of the timing circuits are perturbed then the ensuing activity patterns will be irreversibly altered, thus reducing the accuracy or precision of timed behavioral responses. The third aim is to develop a novel computational framework based on recurrent neural networks models that can predict ""future"" patterns of neural ensemble activity based on ""present"" patterns. The ultimate goal of this work is to integrate highly innovative electrophysiological and computational methods for reverse engineering brain circuit function at the level of networks of hundreds of neurons in the striatum and prefrontal cortex.

"Modeling a neural circuit for flexible control of innate behaviors The adaptive control of social behaviors, such as aggression and reproduction, is a critical function of the nervous system. In the past decade, new methods for genetically targeted functional manipulation and imaging of neural activity have proven phenomenally fruitful in identifying neural subpopulations that play a role in expression of social behaviors. But our understanding of how these neural populations work together in a behaving animal remains highly fractured. In the proposed work, we develop a computational approach to integrate neural imaging data from multiple genetically targeted neural populations and construct a circuit model of social behavior control. A significant challenge in studying social behavior is its high variability and complexity, features that defy traditional trial-averaging-based analyses of neural activity. To address this challenge, we will leverage our recently developed automated tracking system to build a quantitative and detailed model of social behaviors and sensory processing in pairs of freely interacting mice. This behavior model will provide the basis for a thorough statistical analysis of neural dynamics within and between a collection of four subcortical nuclei, which together span three putative layers of processing, the first just past the sensory periphery and the last just upstream of premotor populations in the periaqueductal gray. This analysis will include 1) predicting animals' future behavior from joint neural and behavioral models, 2) characterizing behavior tuning of individual neurons in each nucleus with a linear-nonlinear model, and 3) fitting a network model to imaging data from multiple nuclei, and testing predicted connectivity from this model with a novel optogenetic perturbation system. Finally, we will build on these analyses to address the flexibility of behavior control by network models of subcortical nuclei. In the K99 phase, this research plan will allow me to develop advanced skills in the use of deep learning and recurrent neural networks for data analysis: skills that will be increasingly important as more labs start to study complex behaviors and meso-scale neural circuits. The strong computational environment at Caltech, including the labs of Pietro Perona, Markus Meister, and Doris Tsao, makes it an ideal place to develop my technical training, while the strength of the Anderson lab's experimental program provides a unique chance to collaborate closely with experimentalists in testing and refining models. Additional training in data presentation, teaching, grant-writing, and student mentorship will allow me to transition to an independent position. In the independent R00 phase, I will use these skills and the objectives of my remaining Aims to build a laboratory focused on the study of flexibility and behavioral adaptability in meso-scale neural circuits. Project Narrative This project investigates the network of densely interconnected brain areas that regulate complex social behavior in mammals. A tremendous number of neuropsychiatric conditions, including schizophrenia, autism, generalized anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder, impair or alter patients' social interactions and motivations. In this proposal, I use theory and modeling to bridge the gap from micro-level understanding of local brain activity to a meso-scale model of how brain areas act in concert to shape behavior, providing a tool to better understand mechanisms that disrupt their collective function.",Modeling a neural circuit for flexible control of innate behaviors,9744432,K99MH117264,"['Social Controls ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Stress ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' PTSD ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Students ', ' Teaching ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Generations ', ' base ', ' Medial ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Non-linear Models ', ' Nonlinear Models ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' midbrain central gray substance ', ' periaqueductal gray matter ', ' annulus of the aqueduct ', ' Periaqueductal Gray ', ' Midbrain Central Gray ', ' Mesencephalic Central Gray ', ' Individual ', ' Metabolic ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Behavior Control ', ' behavioral control ', ' Behavioral Manipulation ', ' programs ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Social status ', ' social standing ', ' social position ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' neural circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' Modeling ', ' neuropsychiatry ', ' neuropsychiatric ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' autistic spectrum disorder ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' Infantile Autism ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Autism ', ' Data ', ' Retrieval ', ' Subgroup ', ' Collection ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' neglect ', ' Behavioral Model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' Impairment ', ' neural model ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' network models ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' optogenetics ', ' generalized anxiety ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' predictive test ', ' predictive assay ', ' recurrent neural network ', ' deep learning ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' Affect ', ' Aggressive behavior ', ' Aggression ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdala ', ' Animals ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Beds ', ' Behavior ', ' Animal Behavior ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Cues ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Environment ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' bone fracture ', ' Fracture ', ' Future ', ' Grant ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Animal Housing ', ' Hunger ', ' hypothalamic ', ' Hypothalamus ', ' Hypothalamic structure ', ' Innate Behavior ', ' Instinct ', ' Joints ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' Mammalia ', ' Mammals ', ' Manuals ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Motivation ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' nervous system function ', ' Neurological function ', ' Neurologic function ', ' Nervous System Physiology ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' preoptic region ', ' Preoptic Areas ', ' Reproduction ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' sociobehavior ', ' Social Behavior ', ' ']",NIMH,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,K99,2019,110754,CA-27,-0.15692153233278502
"Single Neuron Analyzer for Multi-modal, Cross-dataset (Epi)genomic Cell Type Datasets Project Summary/Abstract Our project will create a computational resource, the Single Neuron Analyzer, to support the neuroscience community’s efforts to build a reproducible, comprehensive, data-driven atlas of brain cell types. Laboratories in the BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network and others are generating large-scale molecular datasets from multiple regions of the mouse and human brain using single cell sequencing technology. These datasets include single cell and single nucleus transcriptomes (RNA-Seq), as well as single nucleus DNA methylomes (mC-Seq) and chromatin accessibility (ATAC-Seq). Each data type provides complementary information about the molecular identity of brain cells: transcriptomes directly measure gene expression, while epigenomic data indicates both gene expression levels and the activity of intergenic regulatory regions such as enhancers. However, there is no computational resource for integrating these data from these multiple modalities and for statistically validating the reliability and reproducibility of the cell types defined based on each dataset. The Single Neuron Analyzer will work within the framework of the Single Cell Portal, which provides horizontally-scalable, highly performant solutions that allow researchers to efficiently scale with the growing size of datasets as the technology for single cell sequencing advances. In Aim 1, we will use machine learning and cross-validation to study the reproducibility of cell types defined by researchers based on one or more datasets. The Single Neuron Analyzer will allow users to compute a quantitative score, corresponding to the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC), which quantifies the degree to which cell type labels can be predicted based on independent data such as experimental replicates or complementary molecular assays. Aim 2 will build a data integration system that can jointly analyze single cells profiled by different technologies and modalities, including transcriptomic and epigenomic data. We will take advantage of the reliable correlation of gene expression with low gene body DNA methylation and high chromatin accessibility, to link cells measured in one modality with their closest matching neighbors in the other two modalities. The resulting neighbor graphs will be used to impute the missing data, followed by joint cluster analysis and low-dimensional projection of the integrated dataset. Following joint analysis, the system will provide a variety of visualizations and downloadable reports about key markers for each cell type. By combining transcriptomic and epigenomic information, the system will predict cell type specific genes as well as putative enhancers. Single Neuron Analyzer will offer researchers across the neuroscience community a resource for rigorous multi-modal molecular analysis of neuronal cell types, helping to advance the goal of comprehensively understanding the brain’s cellular parts list. Project Narrative Neuroscientists are currently creating large databases of information about the molecular characteristics of brain cell types, such as their patterns of gene expression and epigenetic regulation, in order to better understand the cellular components that make up brain circuits. Our project will create a computational tool, the Single Neuron Analyzer, to integrate different datasets and validate their conclusions. The result will be a system that can reliable and reproducible characterizations of the brain’s cell types and their molecular and genetic regulation.","Single Neuron Analyzer for Multi-modal, Cross-dataset (Epi)genomic Cell Type Datasets",9795063,RF1MH120015,"['Atlases ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Censuses ', ' Chromatin ', ' Cluster Analyses ', ' Cluster Analysis ', ' Communities ', ' Diffusion ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Feedback ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' Information Systems ', ' Institutes ', ' Joints ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Privatization ', ' Receiver Operator Characteristics ', ' Receiver Operating Characteristics ', ' genetic regulatory element ', ' Regulatory Regions ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulator Regions ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Technology ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Enhancers ', ' Molecular Genetics ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Imagery ', ' Visualization ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Systems Integration ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Dimensions ', ' cell type ', ' System ', ' brain cell ', ' Graph ', ' Modality ', ' Reporting ', ' neural circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' Regulation ', ' Sampling ', ' Genomics ', ' Brain region ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Analysis ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' molecular signature ', ' molecular profile ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Resolution ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' computer analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computational analyses ', ' Genomic Segment ', ' genomic region ', ' Neurosciences Research ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' transcriptional signature ', ' gene expression signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' Expression Signature ', ' epigenomics ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' data integration ', ' molecular scale ', ' transcriptomics ', ' computing resources ', ' computational resources ', ' web-accessible ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' methylome ', ' epigenome ', ' cloud based ', ' single cell sequencing ', ' human reference genome ', ' human reference assembly ', ' ATAC-seq ', ' ATACseq ', ' BRAIN initiative ', ' epigenetic regulation ', ' transcriptome ', ' global transcription profile ', ' global gene expression ', ' single cell technology ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' ']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",RF1,2019,1227489,CA-52,0.013888350449482244
"Regulation of social aggression through hippocampal CA2 inputs to lateral septum Heightened levels of social aggression, a motivated behavior, are often associated with neuropsychiatric disease. Although our understanding of the neural mechanisms regulating aggression is incomplete, both lateral septum (LS) and ventral hypothalamus are known to be important. Even though LS receives one of its strongest inputs from hippocampus, a region important for declarative memory, little is known about how hippocampus regulates aggression. Moreover, as hippocampus is implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders associated with altered social behavior and aggression, a basic understanding of how hippocampus and its circuitry regulate aggression will likely yield important new insights into disease mechanisms.  Here we focus on the role of the hippocampal CA2 region in social aggression. Relatively little is known about CA2, largely because of technical problems that limit its study with conventional lesioning approaches. We therefore developed a Cre mouse line that enables us to label and manipulate the activity of CA2 pyramidal neurons. Using a genetic silencing approach, we found that CA2 was critical during non-aggressive social exploration for the formation of social memory, the ability of an animal to recognize and remember another mouse (conspecific), but CA2 was not needed for other forms of hippocampal memory. Our recent results now show that CA2 also promotes social aggression, through an excitatory projection to LS that disinhibits a subnucleus in ventral medial hypothalamus important for aggression. Moreover, we find that the social neuropeptide arginine vasopressin promotes aggression by enhancing the CA2 to LS synapse.  Here we ask: How does a single brain region, CA2, participate in social memory storage during non- aggressive social exploration and promote social aggression? Is there a single population of CA2 neurons that is activated during both social exploration and social aggression? Or are there specialist neurons for each behavior? Does CA2 actively encode distinct representations of social exploration and social aggression, or does CA2 encode a single social salience signal that does not in itself encode aggression but that is gated by the internal state of an animal to promote aggression through CA2 inputs to LS? We will test the hypothesis that vasopressin release in LS acts as such a permissive gate. As vasopressin also enhances social memory by acting within CA2, we will ask: How can a single neuromodulator produce two such distinct actions? Do distinct sources of vasopressin input to CA2 and LS promote, respectively, social memory and aggression?  We will address these questions by characterizing CA2 circuits and neural activity during aggressive and non-aggressive social interactions using: 1. Activity-dependent genetic marking of active CA2 ensembles; 2. Electrophysiological characterization of CA2LS circuits and their regulation by vasopressin in ex vivo brain slices; 3. Behavioral control of aggression using chemogenetics and optogenetics; and 4. In vivo optical and electrophysiological recordings of CA2 activity during non-aggressive and aggressive social interactions. Many neuropsychiatric disorders are associated with increased levels of aggression, which impair patient care and place a burden on society. Here we will examine the neural mechanisms by which the CA2 region of the hippocampus, a relatively unexplored brain region implicated in social memory and schizophrenia, regulates aggressive behavior in mice.",Regulation of social aggression through hippocampal CA2 inputs to lateral septum,9802580,R01MH120292,"['Aggressive behavior ', ' Aggression ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Animals ', ' Argipressin ', ' Vasopressin-Neurophysin II-Copeptin ', ' Arginine Vasopressin ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hippocampus ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' hypothalamic ', ' Hypothalamus ', ' Hypothalamic structure ', ' Medial Hypothalamus ', ' Intermediate Hypothalamic Region ', ' Middle Hypothalamus ', ' Locales ', ' male ', ' Memory ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' Neuropeptides ', ' optical ', ' Optics ', ' Play ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' sociobehavior ', ' Social Behavior ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Societies ', ' synapse ', ' Synaptic ', ' Synapses ', ' Testing ', ' beta-Hypophamine ', ' Antidiuretic Hormones ', ' Antidiuretic Hormone ', ' Vasopressins ', ' Mediating ', ' Specialist ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' Lateral ', ' Dorsal ', ' Presynaptic Terminals ', ' Synaptic Terminals ', ' Synaptic Boutons ', ' Presynaptic Nerve Endings ', ' Axon Terminals ', ' Immediate-Early Genes ', ' Lesion ', ' insight ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Behavior Control ', ' behavioral control ', ' Behavioral Manipulation ', ' Source ', ' extracellular ', ' receptor ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' neuroregulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neural regulation ', ' neural control ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' novel ', ' social ', ' Regulation ', ' Neuromodulator ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' autistic spectrum disorder ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' Infantile Autism ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Autism ', ' in vivo ', ' Slice ', ' Monitor ', ' Output ', ' hippocampal pyramidal neuron ', ' Pyramidal neuron ', ' motivated behavior ', ' maternal aggression ', ' Population ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' Impairment ', ' presynaptic ', ' selective expression ', ' selectively expressed ', ' optogenetics ', ' anatomical tracing ', ' anatomical tract tracer ', ' anatomical tracer ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' ']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,530057,NY-13,0.022938112897824763
"Revealing the transcriptomic basis of neuronal identity through functional meta-analysis PROJECT SUMMARY Our overarching goal is to understand how the relationships between genes contribute to functional properties in neurons and how those functions combine to define types of neurons. This is a central question of basic neuroscience, and one which is newly assessable using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). These data provide high-throughput snapshots of gene activities across thousands of cells and thus shed new light on the relationships between genes within and across cells. We propose to exploit this data in conjunction with previously known details about gene function and neuronal identity to learn new features of both. Our research approach is meta-analytic, using data from many different laboratories to obtain a more robust aggregate signal. In addition to developing meta-analytic methods to pursue our direct research interests, the methods are of broad practical relevance to neuroscience laboratories studying many different questions, including diseases of the nervous system. Disseminating our software deliverables in a convenient-to-use form is a central component of each of our research objectives. The three complementary objectives in this project are to: 1. Learn patterns of gene expression which characterize known cell identity. Building on our previous research showing conserved expression patterns across cell-types, we will define shared gene expression patterns, called co-expression, specific to neuronal sub-populations. These shared expression patterns will be used as an assay into cellular identity. 2.Identify novel cell subtypes through changes in the expression relationships between genes. Variation in co-expression is a form of transcriptional rewiring which often indicates a change in function. To find novel neuronal sub-types we will assess the data for changes in co-expression reflecting a change in functions linked to neuronal identity. We will identify novel transcriptional signatures which replicate across laboratories. 3. Determine consensus methods for customized cell-type learning. Defining wholly unknown expression profiles is likely to benefit from a variety of approaches. In order to find agreement between those approaches, we will develop an algorithm to efficiently search through gene sets likely to find those with complementary value. These gene sets will then be assessed across many pre-existing methods, with customized combinations and aggregate output reported and made available through a public web-server. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent advances in genetics have it made possible to assess gene activity at a cellular level. The primary goal of this project is to develop and validate methods and data resources which combine data from many laboratories to identify how genes interact to produce different functional effects in different types of neurons. Because most gene functions are accomplished in concert with other genes, knowing how genes change their interactions provides key information into how their function might be disrupted in disease.",Revealing the transcriptomic basis of neuronal identity through functional meta-analysis,9706661,R01MH113005,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Communities ', ' Crowding ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Joints ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' Libraries ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Methods ', ' Neurologic Organ System ', ' Neurologic Body System ', ' Nervous System ', ' Nervous system structure ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Noise ', ' Phenotype ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Work ', ' Custom ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Genetic ', ' gene function ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Consensus ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' exhaustion ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' Ablation ', ' functional group ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Agreement ', ' Laboratory Study ', ' Reporting ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Property ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Transcript ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Grouping ', ' groupings ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Output ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' transcriptional signature ', ' gene expression signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' Expression Signature ', ' transcriptomics ', ' candidate marker ', ' candidate biomarker ', ' screening ', ' Data Discovery ', ' data resource ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' in situ sequencing ', ' single-cell RNA sequencing ', ' single cell RNA-seq ', ' scRNA-seq ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' web server ', ' learning algorithm ', ' ']",NIMH,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,R01,2019,480000,NY-03,0.057852380733352006
"Motion Sequencing for Neuropsychiatric Drug Development SUMMARY Neuropsychiatric disorders afflict more than 20% of the global population, resulting enormous personal and societal burdens, including trillions of dollars in total costs. Despite its prevalence and widespread impact, the development of drugs to treat neuropsychiatric diseases significantly lags behind other disease areas. This gap is due primarily to the fact that so few candidate drugs ever make it to the clinic; the average lag time for those that do make it is 13 years, further exacerbating the problem. The success rate for psychiatric drugs is historically low, even as financial investments in the area rise. Developing safe and effective drugs for neuropsychiatric disorders is inherently difficult, as it relies on characterizing the behavioral phenotypes of animal models. Current approaches to this are low-throughput, unreliable, expensive, and minimally informative. Most methods attempt to reduce complex behaviors that depend upon many neural circuits into one or a few quantifiable metrics, which are then used to predict how the candidates will impact the even more complex human nervous system. Syllable Life Sciences was founded on the vision of improving the way we measure and interpret changes in the behavior in the lab to improve pre-clinical drug development. To address this challenge, we have developed a behavioral analysis platform called Motion Sequencing (MoSeq). MoSeq combines machine vision and unsupervised machine learning techniques to objectively identify a set of stereotyped three-dimensional behavioral motifs (rears, turns, head-bobs, runs, pauses, etc.) that encapsulates all the spontaneous actions of mice within a particular experiment. In addition to revealing which motif (termed a “behavioral syllable”) is expressed at each moment, MoSeq identifies the statistics that govern how syllables transition from one to anther over time (“behavioral grammar”). Using MoSeq, therefore, we can comprehensively and quantitatively profile rodent behavior. Our previous work demonstrates that MoSeq directly reflects ongoing brain activity in psychiatry- relevant brain circuits, and that it may significantly outperform more standard methods of phenotyping drug effects in mice. In this SBIR Phase I project, we propose to extend the capabilities of MoSeq and explicitly demonstrate its translational value. Specifically, in Aim 1 we will expand the purview of MoSeq to include neuropsychiatry-relevant circuits; in Aim 2 we will build a behavioral space that describes relationships among drugs spanning the current psychopharmacopeia; and in Aim 3 we will demonstrate the clinical utility of MoSeq by using it to predict clinical trial outcomes. This project will lay essential groundwork for revolutionizing the preclinical pipeline for neuro- and psychotherapeutics. NARRATIVE Syllable Life Sciences is committed to addressing key preclinical bottlenecks that hinder neuropsychiatric drug development. Key to this is to develop more efficient and accurate ways to identify and measure drug impact on behavior in model systems. Motion Sequencing (MoSeq) integrates state-of-the-art 3D cameras and novel machine learning techniques to track changes in rodent behavior in response to drug, and it does so with unprecedented levels of accuracy and temporal resolution.

"Axonal connectomics: dense mapping of projection patterns between cortical areas Project Summary/Abstract Connectomics is a new field, created with the goal of densely or completely mapping the connections in the brain. Because this goal is at present only achievable for small organisms, connectomics has taken on two forms in the study of larger brains. Macroscale connectomics is used to describe the connections between brain areas, which in experimental animals is achieved with tracers, while humans it is typically pursued at a very coarse scale with diffusion imaging, a form of MRI. Microscale connectomics aims to create dense wiring diagrams of local circuits, small volumes of the brain with neurons that form rich networks within a local neighborhood. Macroscale connectomics lacks cellular resolution, while microscale connectomics can only reconstruct small volumes, with little information about the source of inputs entering the volume, or the targets of axons exiting it. We propose to develop a technique to bridge the gap between the microscale and the macroscale by creating experimental and analytical methods for mapping individual axons over long distances, concentrating on the largest 50% of myelinated axons (long-distance “wires”) in the brain. For the current RFA to develop “Tools to Facilitate High-Throughput Microconnectivity Analysis” we are specifically targeting one of the recommended goals, to “Develop a high-quality toolbox of methods for efficiently mapping and annotating projections” in the human brain. The method—based on high-resolution 3D imaging of antibody-stained axons—can be scaled to analyze entire brains, but here we propose to apply it to the posterior pole of a macaque brain, a large (~10 cm3) volume will contain >20 visual cortical areas. The goal is to trace most of the larger axons (>1 um) between these areas, thus creating a dense axonal connectomics data set from the cortical visual system, allowing us to examine not only the hierarchy of visual areas, but also the structure of computational maps. Ultimately, this approach will permit whole-brain analysis of axonal projections, with targeted examination of key circuits for microscale connectomics. While microscale connectomics of whole human brains will remain impossible for the foreseeable future, dense axonal mapping should be achievable in the next 5 to 10 years. This proposal offers a pathway towards this new type brain-wide anatomy: Axonal Connectomics. Project Narrative/Relevance This proposal will contribute to the fundamental question of how the brain is wired, in particular the pathways by which individual neurons communicate over long distances between different parts of the brain. One of the most promising treatments for a variety of brain disease—deep brain stimulation—is thought to work largely by activating these long distance “wires”, so a thorough understanding of their trajectories might have considerable long-term clinical importance.",Axonal connectomics: dense mapping of projection patterns between cortical areas,9822860,RF1MH117820,"['Anatomy ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Animals ', ' Antibodies ', ' Atlases ', ' Automation ', ' Axon ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Cerebral cortex ', ' Data Collection ', ' Diffusion ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' substantia grisea ', ' gray matter ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Judgment ', ' Laboratories ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Illumination ', ' Lighting ', ' Macaque ', ' Macaca ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Microscopy ', ' Electron Microscopy ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Neuroanatomies ', ' Neuranatomy ', ' Neuranatomies ', ' Neuroanatomy ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' Neurosciences ', ' occipital cortex ', ' Occipital lobe ', ' living system ', ' Organism ', ' Paper ', ' parietal cortex ', ' Parietal Lobe ', ' Perception ', ' Primates Mammals ', ' Primates ', ' Staining method ', ' Stains ', ' temporal cortex ', ' Temporal Lobe ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' visual cortical ', ' Visual Cortex ', ' Work ', ' neurofilament NF-H protein ', ' neurofilament 200 ', ' high-molecular-weight neurofilament protein ', ' NFP-200 ', ' NF-H protein ', ' neurofilament protein H ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Microscopic ', ' Link ', ' Lesion ', ' Individual ', ' nonhuman primate ', ' non-human primate ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Deep Brain Stimulation ', ' light microscopy ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' 3D ', ' 3-D ', ' Visual system structure ', ' Visual System ', ' physical mapping ', ' Informatics ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' white matter ', ' substantia alba ', ' Three-Dimensional Imaging ', ' 3D imaging ', ' 3-D Imaging ', ' brain volume ', ' Diameter ', ' Caliber ', ' tissue processing ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Tracer ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' vector ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' extrastriate visual cortex ', ' visual area ', ' extrastriate cortex ', ' extrastriate area ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' connectome ', ' petabyte ', ' imaging approach ', ' imaging based approach ', ' Infrastructure ', ' connectome data ', ' connectomic data ', ' ']",NIMH,ALLEN INSTITUTE,RF1,2019,2312287,WA-07,-0.02225704871210327
"Motion Sequencing for All: pipelining, distribution and training to enable broad adoption of a next-generation platform for behavioral and neurobehavioral analysis Understanding the function of the nervous system requires a sophisticated understanding of its main output, behavior. Although our ability to record from and to manipulate neurons and neural circuits has accelerated at a spectacular pace over the last decade, progress has lagged in coupling the interrogation of the nervous system to similarly high-resolution measures of behavior. As a consequence, we lack a sophisticated understanding of how the brain composes, modifies and controls action.  We have recently developed a transformative behavioral characterization technology called Motion Sequencing (MoSeq), which circumvents many of the limitations imposed by typical approaches to behavioral measurement (e.g., overtraining, head-fixation, limited behavioral flexibility). This analytical system works by capturing comprehensive and continuous morphometric data about the three-dimensional (3D) posture of a mouse as it freely behaves. The 3D data are then analyzed using an unsupervised machine learning algorithm to identify patterns of motion that correspond to stereotyped and reused modules of sub-second behavior (which by analogy to natural language we refer to as behavioral “syllables”). The output of this fitting procedure is a parts list for behavior: a limited set of syllables out of which the rodent creates all of its observable action. In addition, within any given experiment MoSeq identifies the specific transition structure (or “grammar”) that places individual syllables into sequences; these sequences encode all patterns of spontaneous behavior expressed by an animal in a given experimental context. We have recently combined this behavioral assessment technology with techniques for neural recording, allowing us to assess the relationship between neural activity in behaviorally-relevant circuits and patterns of action. This combined approach allowed us, for example, to identify a code for elemental 3D pose dynamics in striatum; importantly, these observed correlations validate MoSeq as a technology that enables accurate inference of internal states from external states. However, the code that underlies MoSeq is essentially bespoke, inappropriate for distribution, and difficult for all but expert users to navigate. In addition, implementing MoSeq in its current form requires extensive prior mathematical and computational experience, limiting its use to a small set of users with specialized skills. Here we propose Aims to democratize MoSeq by (1) transforming it into an end-to-end pipeline that can be easily used by graduate-student level neuroscientists with minimal expertise, and which can be modified on an ongoing basis to accommodate improvements to MoSeq and (2) to offer hands-on training in the set-up and appropriate use of MoSeq for characterizing behavior and neural-behavioral relationships. Together these aims will create a vibrant community of MoSeq users; the creation of such a group has the potential to transform the way behavior is analyzed across neuroscience, and promises to lead to broad insights into the many and varied relationships between neural circuits and behavior. A central goal of neurobiology is to reveal how the brain generates and organizes action, but we lack sophisticated tools for objectively and comprehensively characterizing behavior. We have developed a next- generation method called Motion Sequencing (MoSeq) that affords unprecedented insight into how the brain organizes behavior; however, using this approach requires substantial expertise, which has slowed its adoption by the scientific community. Here we propose to streamline and package the underlying code, and to offer hands-on training, so that users without extensive computer science or math backgrounds can easily use MoSeq to characterize animal behavior as part of efforts to understand how genes, drugs or neural activity changes action.","Motion Sequencing for All: pipelining, distribution and training to enable broad adoption of a next-generation platform for behavioral and neurobehavioral analysis",9654850,U24NS109520,"['Adoption ', ' Animals ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Behavior ', ' Animal Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Calcium ', ' Communities ', ' striatal ', ' Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Head ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Math ', ' Mathematics ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Motion ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' Persons ', ' Neurologic Organ System ', ' Neurologic Body System ', ' Nervous System ', ' Nervous system structure ', ' nervous system function ', ' Neurological function ', ' Neurologic function ', ' Nervous System Physiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Posture ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodent ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Stereotyping ', ' Technology ', ' Technology Assessment ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Pythons ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' awake ', ' Individual ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Data Storage and Retrieval ', ' data storage ', ' data retrieval ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' 3D ', ' 3-D ', ' experience ', ' behavior measurement ', ' behavioral measurement ', ' behavioral measure ', ' voltage ', ' computer science ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' graduate student ', ' Reporting ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' neural circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' Modeling ', ' behavioral assessment ', ' Behavior assessment ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Collection ', ' Validation ', ' sample fixation ', ' Fixation ', ' Behavioral ', ' Output ', ' web services ', ' web-based service ', ' Instruction ', ' neurobehavioral ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' Imaging technology ', ' Population ', ' Coupling ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' open source ', ' graphical user interface ', ' graphic user interface ', ' Graphical interface ', ' data format ', ' natural language ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' Cloud Computing ', ' cloud computer ', ' Cloud Infrastructure ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine vision ', ' ']",NINDS,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,U24,2019,455655,MA-07,-0.07381783952572737
"Uncovering the molecular identity of retinal cell types, and their responses to nerve injury using single-cell transcriptomics ABSTRACT Neurons of the central nervous system (CNS) have been historically categorized into discrete ""types"" based on structure, physiological responses, connectivity patterns, and molecular profiles. Heterogeneity can have other consequences- e.g. recent studies have found that some neuronal types in the retina are more resilient than other types to optic nerve injury, an event that leads to irrecoverable damage in vision. My project combines cutting-edge single-cell genomic technologies, advanced computational data analysis and molecular tools to define heterogeneity of neuronal types comprehensively, to connect molecular definitions to histology, and explore the functional consequences of this heterogeneity during nerve injury. I will focus on a tractable system, the mouse retina, which communicates visual responses to the brain. It is as complex as any other region of the brain (containing ~120 neuronal types), but benefits from having a compact, accessible structure, and experimental tools make it especially suited for detailed analyses. Building on my previous postdoctoral work, this project will, 1) Complete the census of the mouse retina, which will the first for any CNS region, by inferring molecular taxonomies of two of its most heterogenous classes (amacrines and ganglion cells) from data collected using high-throughput single-cell RNA-sequencing. Using the mouse census, initiate a similar mapping of the macaque retina, which is harder to access experimentally, but shares important features with humans that are absent in mice. 2) Conduct a systematic investigation of cell-type specific responses in the retina to optic nerve injury. This usually leads to a rapid, stereotypic death of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), but a recent study by my colleagues reported that some RGC types are more resilient than others. Here, using 1) as a resource, I will identify factors, cell intrinsic and extrinsic, that make these RGC types resilient. 3) Selective resilience of cell types is now recognized as a feature of diseases like glaucoma and stroke. Therapies therefore need to cater to different cell types. To learn more, and derive general principles, I will examine the impact of known therapeutic interventions on the survival of different RGC types, and the underlying molecular responses, within the optic nerve injury model. Taken together, my project will derive substantial molecular information underlying neuronal heterogeneity in the mouse and macaque retina and general principles for cell-type selective resilience following CNS injury in mice. The lessons from this work will provide valuable guidance for similar studies in less accessible regions of the brain (e.g. cerebral cortex).   NARRATIVE The central nervous system (CNS) is made up of a large diversity of neuronal types, a major proportion of which remain to be identified and defined in terms of molecular markers so that their roles in function and dysfunction can be assessed. This project seeks to combine high-throughput single-cell transcriptomics, innovative computational and histological methods to comprehensively define neuronal heterogeneity in an accessible system – the mouse retina, and use this as a foundation to (1) initiate a similar mapping of the macaque retina, and (2) study cell-type specific responses in a tractable model of nerve injury (optic nerve crush) to map the resilience of different cell types, and identify molecular correlates underlying these differences. Our work will create transformational tools to address similar challenges in other CNS regions.","Uncovering the molecular identity of retinal cell types, and their responses to nerve injury using single-cell transcriptomics",9650587,K99EY028625,"['Axon ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Felis sylvestris catus ', ' Felis domesticus ', ' Felis domestica ', ' Feline Species ', ' Domestic Cats ', ' Cats Mammals ', ' Cats ', ' Felis catus ', ' Cell-to-Cell Interaction ', ' Cell Interaction ', ' Cell Communication ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Censuses ', ' Cerebral cortex ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Foundations ', ' Gene Expression ', ' glaucomatous ', ' Glaucoma ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Histology ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Inflammation ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Learning ', ' Macaque ', ' Macaca ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' Nerve Crush ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Second Cranial Nerve ', ' Cranial Nerve II ', ' Optic Nerve ', ' Physiology ', ' regenerate ', ' Regeneration ', ' Natural regeneration ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Retina ', ' retinal ganglion ', ' Retinal Ganglion Cells ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Stroke ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Technology ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' vertebrata ', ' Vertebrate Animals ', ' Vertebrates ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' Work ', ' Molecular Genetics ', ' Mediating ', ' General Taxonomy ', ' Taxonomy ', ' Optic Nerve Injuries ', ' Traumatic Optic Neuropathy ', ' Second Cranial Nerve Trauma ', ' Second Cranial Nerve Injuries ', ' Optic Nerve Trauma ', ' Cranial Nerve II Injuries ', ' nerve injury ', ' neural injury ', ' Custom ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' Histologic ', ' Histologically ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' ganglion cell ', ' gangliocyte ', ' Amacrine Cells ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Plant Roots ', ' root ', ' Functional disorder ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' Morphology ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Immune ', ' Immunes ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' neuroprotection ', ' Recovery of Function ', ' functional recovery ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Structure ', ' Reporting ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Genomics ', ' Neuraxis ', ' Central Nervous System ', ' CNS Nervous System ', ' injured CNS ', ' CNS Injury ', ' central nervous system injury ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' molecular signature ', ' molecular profile ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' in vivo ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' computer analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computational analyses ', ' Molecular ', ' Behavioral ', ' injured ', ' knock-down ', ' knockdown ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' resilience ', ' Retinal ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' transcriptomics ', ' retinal neuron ', ' novel marker ', ' novel biomarker ', ' new marker ', ' molecular marker ', ' molecular biomarker ', ' Tumor-infiltrating immune cells ', ' T cell tumor trafficking ', ' T cell infiltration ', ' Immune infiltrates ', ' human model ', ' single-cell RNA sequencing ', ' single cell RNA-seq ', ' scRNA-seq ', ' stroke-like episode ', ' stroke-like ischemic event ', ' stroke-like insult ', ' stroke-like injury ', ' stroke-like event ', ' retinal ganglion cell regeneration ', ' ']",NEI,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",K99,2019,107618,MA-07,0.03336157137193597
"The behavioral functions of upper and lower cortical layers PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The cerebral cortex mediates all of human and animal cognition, encompassing a diverse set of abilities including sensation, perception, decision making, and motor planning. Dysfunctions of the cerebral cortex are thought to underlie numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders. A major obstacle both to understanding normal behaving and to treating pathology is the high degree of complexity of cortical circuitry, which has remained largely enigmatic. The conventional view of neocortex has been that sensory processing begins in layer 4 (L4), which was identified a century ago as the principal target of thalamic axons carrying information from our sensory organs. Sensory transforms are widely believed to occur as excitation spreads serially along the densest axonal pathways (thalamus→L4→L2/3→L5/6). Recently we discovered that the cerebral cortex, rather than being a monolithic structure, may contain two entirely separate processing systems, activated by the same signals arising from the thalamus. L4 is thus not an obligatory distribution hub for cortical activity, and thalamus activates two distinct “strata” of cortex in parallel.  This proposal's goal is to identify the behavioral and computational roles of the upper (L2-4) and lower strata (L5/6) as well as the interactions between them. We will investigate the behavioral roles of these layers in the mouse whisker system. Specific layers will be optogenetically disrupted in a series of tactile behavioral tasks, in which task complexity is progressively increased. Interlaminar interactions will also be studied by recording electrophysiologically from specific layers during behavior and using novel machine learning techniques designed to identify the type of computation performed in different levels of “deep networks”. The dimensionality of the representation in a layer will be estimated under normal behaviors and when specific layers are inactivated.  Identifying fundamental functions of upper versus cortical layers will likely pave the way for future studies in other neocortical systems and in higher-order species. Moreover, as the different layers contain molecularly and biophysically distinct cell types and project to distinct downstream targets, specific neurological disorders may involve dysfunction of specific pathways, cell types, and layers. Establishing the behavioral and computational roles of these elements may contribute to development of targeted therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Dysfunctions of the cerebral cortex are thought to underlie numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders, but the behavioral and functional roles of cortical layers and cell types are unknown. Identifying the contributions of specific cortical layers to normal circuit function will lead to better treatment of pathological conditions.     ",The behavioral functions of upper and lower cortical layers,9695015,R01NS094659,"['Animals ', ' Axon ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Biophysics ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Cerebral cortex ', ' Cognition ', ' striatal ', ' Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Decision Making ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Elements ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' Pathology ', ' Perception ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Sensation ', ' Esthesia ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Medulla Spinalis ', ' Spinal Cord ', ' synapse ', ' Synaptic ', ' Synapses ', ' Task Performances ', ' Testing ', ' thalamic ', ' Thalamus ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' Whiskers ', ' Vibrissae ', ' Halorhodopsin Chromoprotein ', ' Halorhodopsins ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Neocortex ', ' neopallium ', ' isocortex ', ' homotypical cortex ', ' Organ ', ' Area ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' Functional disorder ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Morphology ', ' Shapes ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Dimensions ', ' Tactile ', ' Auditory ', ' Complex ', ' Sensory ', ' Source ', ' cell type ', ' Texture ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Performance ', ' sensory discrimination ', ' Structure ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' Modality ', ' response ', ' object shape ', ' Detection ', ' Motor ', ' Sensory Physiology ', ' Pathologic ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Output ', ' hippocampal pyramidal neuron ', ' Pyramidal neuron ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' neocortical ', ' spatial integration ', ' optogenetics ', ' biophysical properties ', ' biophysical parameters ', ' biophysical measurement ', ' biophysical characterization ', ' biophysical characteristics ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted therapy ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' ']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,350000,NY-13,0.016104323019090785
"Accessible technologies for high-throughput, whole-brain reconstructions of molecularly characterized mammalian neurons SUMMARY The BRAIN Initiative seeks to accelerate the development and application of innovative technologies that ultimately will revolutionize our understanding of the human brain. A central current focus of the brain initiative is to enable a swift and comprehensive survey of all brain cell types and circuits. Recently, single cell transcriptomics is helping to classify cell types by their expression patterns. Transcriptomic analysis is currently unique in that it scales to the entire mouse brain and all cell types. However, the correspondence between transcriptomic clusters and cell types, as defined by connectivity or physiology, is not clear. Classification of cell types will require integrative analysis of at least two data elements at the cellular level: (1) molecular signature (e.g., transcriptome), (2) anatomy (e.g., location, morphology, connectivity). We therefore propose here to elevate the complete reconstruction of the morphology of molecularly defined neurons from a small-scale artisanal method to a technology that scales to the analysis of all neuron types across the entire brain thereby providing critical information about cell types, neuronal structure and connectivity. To achieve this goal, we will build on an existing research partnership between the Departments of Neuroscience and Biomedial Engineering at Johns Hopkins University and Janelia Research Campus to develop novel tools for the reconstruction of molecularly defined neuronal subtypes. We will develop scalable imaging technology and neuro-informatics tools for morpho-molecular analysis that will be made available to researchers for a community wide effort of the mapping of all neuronal cell types and connections at and unprecedented scale and depth. Preliminary data demonstrate the feasibility of our approach that will be further developed to enhance speed on a generally usable platform. We will also develop affordable tools for data storage and retrieval. Molecular identification of neurons is designed to take advantage of information from the BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network (BICCN) to integrate data across platforms into a common Brain Atlas. Data collected in this proposal will be integrated into the searchable BICCN database at the Allen Brain Institute.

"Using deep brain stimulation of the parietal cortex to investigate the electrophysiology of human episodic memory Project Summary Our proposal seeks to build upon the success of our lab investigating the electrophysiology of human memory through novel experiments that will elucidate hippocampal—parietal interactions in memory processing. The key innovations of this proposal are the application of direct brain stimulation to the mesial parietal cortex and the adaptation of an associative recognition paradigm to intracranial data. We will take advantage of our high-volume epilepsy surgical center specializing in stereo EEG electrode implantation. In our first aim, we will compare how electrophysiological patterns of brain activation differ between free recall (which comprises the bulk of intracranial memory data) and associative recognition, specifically examining properties of theta oscillations in the anterior versus posterior hippocampus. In the second aim, we will apply deep brain stimulation to the mesial parietal cortex during memory encoding and retrieval, observing differences in memory performance and hippocampal oscillatory activity that will inform hypotheses of how this area supports episodic memory. In Aim 3, we will use machine learning classifiers to understand how mesial parietal stimulation affects memory performance via its impact on brain oscillatory activity in a responsive stimulation paradigm. These experiments will utilize our lab’s knowledge and infrastructure gained through participation in the DARPA Restoring Active Memory project. While our proposal is highly innovative, our center’s proven success in recruiting a large volume of stereo EEG patients for memory research, data collection, and the application of advanced analytic techniques give us confidence that we will collect high quality data addressing the critical gaps in the understanding of human memory. Project Narrative Two critical gaps in our understanding of human memory are whether or not hippocampal theta oscillations support encoding in the same manner as in rodents, and the contribution of the mesial parietal cortex in encoding versus retrieval. These questions are closely linked together, and we propose to study them in stereo EEG patients using a novel memory paradigm coupled with deep brain stimulation. Our planned experiments include a closed-loop stimulation paradigm seeking to use parietal stimulation to improve memory performance, the results of which will both inform theories of human episodic memory processing and of the design of therapeutic brain stimulation devices to treat cognitive deficits.",Using deep brain stimulation of the parietal cortex to investigate the electrophysiology of human episodic memory,9767893,R01NS107357,"['Affect ', ' Aging ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Data Collection ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Electrodes ', ' EEG ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' epileptogenic ', ' epileptiform ', ' epilepsia ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' Epileptics ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Exhibits ', ' Goals ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hippocampus ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Literature ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' hepatic body system ', ' Liver ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' parietal cortex ', ' Parietal Lobe ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodent ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Societies ', ' temporal cortex ', ' Temporal Lobe ', ' Testing ', ' thalamic ', ' Thalamus ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Lateral ', ' Anterior ', ' Area ', ' Animal Experiments ', ' Link ', ' Data Quality ', ' analog ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Attenuated ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Deep Brain Stimulation ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Parietal ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' memory recognition ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Episodic memory ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' memory process ', ' memory processing ', ' memory retrieval ', ' Cognitive deficits ', ' cognitive defects ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Memory Loss ', ' memory decline ', ' Property ', ' theories ', ' Brain region ', ' Effectiveness ', ' degenerative disease ', ' degenerative condition ', ' Degenerative Disorder ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Retrieval ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' direct application ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' implantation ', ' human disease ', ' memory encoding ', ' novel therapeutic intervention ', ' novel therapy approach ', ' novel therapeutic approach ', ' new therapy approaches ', ' new therapeutic strategies ', ' new therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic approach ', ' human imaging ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' recruit ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NINDS,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2019,359585,TX-30,0.03733364866758693
"Quantifying causality for neuroscience Abstract: Causality is central to neuroscience. For example, we might ask about the causal effect of a neuron on another neuron, or its influence on perception, action, or cognition. Moreover, any medical approaches aim at producing a causal effect – effecting improvements for patients. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are the gold standard to establish causality, but they are not always practical. For example, while we can electrically or optogenetically activate entire areas, large-scale targeted stimulation of individual neurons is hard. Other ways of establishing causality are problematic: if we observe a correlation it is hard to know its cause. The problem is confounding: there are variables that we do not record that affect the variables we do. This also renders model comparisons problematic – a causally wrong model with few parameters may well fit the observed data better than a causally correct one with many parameters. We thus need data analysis tools that allow authoritatively asking causal questions without the need for random perturbation experiments.  Just like neuroscience now, the field of econometrics once focused on correlations. But since the 1980s, empirical economics has undergone a so-called credibility revolution, requiring the development of rigorous methods to establish causality. Several successful methods have emerged to become the workhorses of empirical economics. The idea underlying these methods is that if one can observe variables that approximate random perturbations, then one can still discover causal relations. This is what economists call a quasi-experiment. We here propose to carry over such quasi-experimental techniques to neuroscience. For example in neuroscience, if there is a random variable that affects only one neuron, then any activity in other neurons correlated with that variable must be causally affected by the neuron. Another famous quasi- experimental method is regression discontinuity design (RDD). This approach effectively uses the noise introduced at the threshold to identify causal relations. Importantly, such techniques have, thanks to decades of research in econometrics, very well understood statistical properties. These approaches promise to considerably enrich the approaches towards causality we have in neuroscience. We have a strong interdisciplinary team, spanning economics, experimental, and computational neuroscience, collaborating on adapting these quasi-experimental techniques to problems in neuroscience through a combination of machine learning and domain-specific engineering. This promises to be a major advance relative to current techniques that generally approach causality in neuroscience through model comparison. Project Narrative: The goal of this project is to develop a set of computational techniques that allow neuroscientists to quantify how neurons causally influence one another. To do so, it utilizes approaches popular in econometrics called quasiexperiments. Such approaches to quantify causality is important as medical perturbations of brains, e.g. treatments of epilepsy or depression are aimed at effecting or causing a change in the brain.",Quantifying causality for neuroscience,9775861,R01EB028162,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Cognition ', ' Communities ', ' Epidemiologic Confounding Factor ', ' Confounding Variables ', ' Confounding Factors (Epidemiology) ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Economics ', ' Engineering ', ' epileptogenic ', ' epileptiform ', ' epilepsia ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' Epileptics ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Noise ', ' living system ', ' Organism ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Research ', ' synapse ', ' Synaptic ', ' Synapses ', ' Glean ', ' base ', ' computational neuroscience ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Refractory ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Medical ', ' Individual ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Techniques ', ' Performance ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' phrases ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Data ', ' Computational Technique ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Output ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Quasi-experiment ', ' optogenetics ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Injections ', ' econometrics ', ' ']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,1102106,PA-03,0.03774620837982755
"Neuron and Glial Cellular Signatures from Normal and Diseased iPS Cells     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a critical need to define the state and predict the behavior of human brain cells in health and disease. The number of different cell types in the CNS remains undefined, and despite a demographically ordained wave of neurodegenerative diseases, not a single disease-modifying therapy exists. Our  knowledge of the CNS and the foundation for intervening rationally in disease would be dramatically  advanced by generating quantitative molecular phenotypes essentially cell signatures of human neurons,  astrocytes and oligodendrocytes from healthy people and from patients with motor neuron disease,  Huntington's disease, and Parkinson's disease. The CNS is so unique that studying non-neuronal cells does not provide much assistance. Despite this desperate need, the inaccessibility of human brain cells meant studying them would have been impossible until the recent discovery of cellular reprogramming and induced pluripotent stem cell technology.  Here we propose to form the NeuroLINCS consortium to accomplish these goals. We have handpicked the team to bring in critical expertise in iPSC technology, disease modeling, transcriptomics, epigenomics, metabolomics, whole genome sequencing, proteomics, high content, high throughput longitudinal single cell analysis, other cell-based assays, bioinformatics, statistics and computational biology. In addition, we are collaborating with Google to bring in special expertise in machine learning and the integration of signatures across platforms into highly predictive models of responses to perturbagens. Together, we expect to develop cell signatures of an array of human brain cell types under different conditions that should be broadly applicable to the LINCs community. We also anticipate generating innovative software tools and approaches that will make the signature generating process cheaper, faster, and more reliable.  Besides the unique combination of expertise represented within NeuroLINCS, another distinguishing feature is the long track record that its members have of collaborating with each other. That collaborative spirit will be expressed in NeuroLINCS through its significant and multifaceted community outreach programs. These will involve specific and detailed plans to make the data and tools that NeuroLINCS generates available to the community, to interact with other LINCS sites, and to prepare for DCIC and the prospect of disseminating knowledge and resources at scale.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The cellular signatures of human neurons we identify can be used to provide insights into the molecular factors that distinguish central neurons from healthy people from those of patients with neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS, SMA, PD and HD. These insights will provide molecular targets that can be used to develop new drugs to block the progression of these diseases which are presently untreatable.            ",Neuron and Glial Cellular Signatures from Normal and Diseased iPS Cells,9790982,U54NS091046,"['Affect ', ' Astrocytes ', ' astrocytic glia ', ' Astroglia ', ' Astrocytus ', ' Behavior ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cell Differentiation ', ' Cell Differentiation process ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Communities ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Foundations ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' inherited genetic disorder ', ' inherited genetic disease ', ' inherited diseases ', ' inborn error ', ' hereditary disorder ', ' Inherited disorder ', ' Inborn Genetic Diseases ', ' Hereditary Disease ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Huntingtons Disease ', "" Huntington's Disease Pathway "", "" Huntington's Disease "", "" Huntington's "", ' Huntington Chorea ', ' Huntington Disease ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Libraries ', ' motoneuron ', ' Motor Cell ', ' Motor Neurons ', ' Cruveilhier disease ', ' Aran-Duchenne disease ', ' Spinal Muscular Atrophy ', ' Persons ', ' nerve cement ', ' Nonneuronal cell ', ' Non-neuronal cell ', ' Neuroglial Cells ', "" Kolliker's reticulum "", ' Glial Cells ', ' Glia ', ' Neuroglia ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' Oligodendroglia Cell ', ' Oligodendrocytus ', ' Oligodendrocytes ', ' Oligodendroglia ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Parkinsons disease ', "" Parkinson's disease "", "" Parkinson's "", ' Parkinson ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Patients ', ' Physiology ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Software Tools ', ' statistics ', ' Technology ', ' Textbooks ', ' Time ', ' degenerative disorder of motor neurons ', ' Motor Neuron Disease ', ' Signal Transduction Pathway ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' cancer cell ', ' Malignant Cell ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Computational Biology ', ' computer biology ', ' Knowledge ', ' Cellular biology ', ' cell biology ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' cell type ', ' Neurodegenerative Disorders ', ' neurodegenerative illness ', ' degenerative neurological diseases ', ' degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons ', ' Neurologic Degenerative Conditions ', ' Neurodegenerative Diseases ', ' Neural degenerative Disorders ', ' Neural Degenerative Diseases ', ' Nervous System Degenerative Diseases ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Disorders ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Diseases ', ' brain cell ', ' receptor ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' single cell analysis ', ' Scourge ', ' Structure ', ' member ', ' Disease model ', ' disorder model ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' outreach program ', ' response ', ' Proteomics ', ' Neuraxis ', ' Central Nervous System ', ' CNS Nervous System ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabolomics ', ' genome sequencing ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' molecular signature ', ' molecular profile ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' Molecular Target ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' epigenomics ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' Familial Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' transcriptomics ', ' Network-based ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new drugs ', ' new drug treatments ', ' loss of function ', ' induced pluripotent stem cell ', ' iPSCs ', ' iPSC ', ' iPS ', ' disease-causing mutation ', ' stem cell technology ', ' public health relevance ', ' molecular phenotype ', ' Data Provenance ', ' whole genome ', ' full genome ', ' entire genome ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,U54,2019,1422765,CA-45,0.054984560782235244
"Hippocampo-cortical circuit mechanisms of neuronal sequences during learning PROJECT SUMMARY  The goal of this project is to understand the circuit mechanisms underlying neuronal sequence coordination across hippocampus and neocortex and their role in learning and memory. Cells that participated in a recent experience are reactivated in the form of ordered sequences that recapitulate behavior in a temporally compressed manner. These reactivations are coordinated by synchronous network events known as sharp-wave ripples (SWRs) that originate in the hippocampus and propagate to the neocortex. It has been proposed that SWRs and associated neuronal sequences mediate memory consolidation, planning and learning but a direct proof of these functions is still lacking. Additionally, several brain disorders characterized by learning and memory deficits have been related to disrupted SWRs. To guide behavior and decision making, the neocortex is believed to generalize across individual experiences encoded in the hippocampus to infer environmental regularities and rules. SWRs entrain neocortical activity, but how downstream cortical areas read out the hippocampal code transmitted during SWRs and use this information to guide goal-oriented behavior is unknown.  I will perform silicon probe recordings and optogenetic manipulations in the hippocampus and its main cortical target regions of behaving rats and mice to test the functional role and circuit mechanisms of SWR sequences during the different phases of goal-oriented behavior. First, I will use a novel optogenetic approach for closed-loop manipulation of SWRs to directly test whether SWRs associated sequences support memory-guided behavior. My preliminary data supports the hypothesis that SWRs became longer with increased memory demands thus allowing extended replay events, and that those prolonged sequences are necessary and sufficient for memory-guided navigation and spatial learning. Second, I will examine the impact of SWRs on downstream cortical targets, in the context of goal-oriented spatial behavior. I will test if there is a specific functional topography of hippocampo-cortical interactions, with dorsal and ventral hippocampal SWRs propagating preferentially to retrosplenial and prefrontal cortices. I hypothesized that hippocampo –cortical synchrony during SWRs will gradually increase with learning and that this process could lead to the generation of abstract representations, or schemas, in the cortex that will facilitate future decisions. Finally, I will test whether SWR-associated cortical sequences are locally generated or inherited from the hippocampus and how different classes of interneurons contribute to them. To achieve this, I will record and optogenetically manipulate different cell sub-types in transgenic mice.  By using an innovative experimental approach, the proposed project will provide novel insights into the circuit mechanisms and behavioral role of neuronal sequences involved in learning and memory. This knowledge will also shed light into the mechanisms underlying memory deficits in neural disorders such as Alzheimer disease, schizophrenia and intellectual disability. It may also open new avenues for more targeted, closed-loop interventions in these disorders.  The scientific skills developed during the training period of this project will be crucial for the accomplishment of the immediate scientific goals and become the pillars for the research I will develop in my future independent laboratory. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this project is to understand how distributed brain circuits generate neuronal dynamics that support learning and memory. It will directly test if the sequential reactivation of cell assemblies that recapitulate experience is necessary for memory-guided behavior and elucidate how these sequences are coordinated on a global scale. These experiments will not only be important for understanding the physiological mechanisms of learning and memory in healthy brains but also how neuronal disorders such as Alzheimer or schizophrenia lead to their impairment.",Hippocampo-cortical circuit mechanisms of neuronal sequences during learning,9805996,K99MH120343,"[""Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Decision Making ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hippocampus ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Internuncial Neuron ', ' Internuncial Cell ', ' Intercalated Neurons ', ' Intercalary Neuron ', ' Connector Neuron ', ' Interneurons ', ' Laboratories ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Memory ', ' working memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Transgenic Mice ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Rat ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Rattus ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Si element ', ' Silicon ', ' Sleep ', ' Spatial Behavior ', ' synapse ', ' Synaptic ', ' Synapses ', ' Testing ', ' Generations ', ' Mediating ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' Neocortex ', ' neopallium ', ' isocortex ', ' homotypical cortex ', ' goal oriented behavior ', ' improved ', ' Dorsal ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Memory impairment ', ' memory dysfunction ', ' Memory Deficit ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Behavior Control ', ' behavioral control ', ' Behavioral Manipulation ', ' Knowledge ', ' Inherited ', ' Hereditary ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Intellectual functioning disability ', ' intellectual and developmental disability ', ' Intellectual limitation ', ' Intellectual disability ', ' Viral ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' cell assembly ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' neural circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Brain region ', ' Data ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Impairment ', ' neocortical ', ' neural patterning ', ' optogenetics ', ' memory consolidation ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' ']",NIMH,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,K99,2019,129087,NY-12,-0.010291226600347406
"Role of the Hippocampal-mPFC Pathway in Social Memory Deficits in Autism PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The hippocampus is critical for the formation and consolidation of spatial memories and contributes to other cognitive tasks through its efferent projections. The goal of this project is to determine whether altered neuronal network activity in the hippocampus of an autism mouse model propagates to, and alters distal cortical regions involved in social behaviors.  One of the core symptoms of autism spectrum disorders, such as Rett syndrome (RTT), is a deficit in social interaction. In mice, similar social behavior impairments can be modeled by altering the excitation and inhibition (E/I) balance in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). For RTT, knocking out the gene that is mutated in humans, Mecp2, causes hyperactivity in the ventral hippocampus (vHIP) due to an E/I imbalance driven by impaired inhibition and enhanced excitation, resulting in saturated synaptic plasticity at excitatory synapses. Intriguingly, CA1 pyramidal neurons of the vHIP project their axons to the mPFC, making direct monosynaptic connections with excitatory pyramidal neurons and inhibitory interneurons. We propose to characterize how the vHIP influences mPFC activity through this long-range monosynaptic glutamatergic projection. Importantly, we will test whether altered vHIP network activity is causal to mPFC dysfunction and deficits in social interaction. We hypothesize that atypically strong vHIP afferents alter network activity in the mPFC of Mecp2 KO mice by affecting the E/I balance and synaptic plasticity, which in turn contributes to social interaction deficits. To test this hypothesis, we will identify the cellular targets of direct vHIP afferents in the mPFC of RTT mice and characterize their function in social behaviors using a combination of optogenetics, chemogenetics, ex vivo and in vivo electrophysiology and Ca2+ imaging, anterograde and retrograde tract tracing, and unbiased machine-learning behavioral assessments.  We propose the following Specific Aims: 1) identify and characterize the cellular targets of the monosynaptic projection from the vHIP to the mPFC in Mecp2 KO mice; 2) characterize long-term synaptic plasticity of the vHIP-mPFC projection in Mecp2 KO mice; and 3) determine if chemogenetic modulation of the activity of mPFC-projecting vHIP neurons alters mPFC function and social behaviors.  These studies will provide fundamental information on the functional and structural properties of the long- range connection between the vHIP and mPFC in the developing brain. The impact of this work extends beyond RTT to other neuropsychiatric disorders in which propagation of network dysfunction from the hippocampus to the mPFC is believed to contribute to cognitive deficits. PROJECT NARRATIVE Rett syndrome is a syndromic autism-spectrum disorder that presents with deficits in social behaviors and cognitive abilities, which may result from impaired function of the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. The proposed study is the first characterization of a long-range monosynaptic connection in Rett mice using optogenetics and chemogenetics, and will test whether hippocampal hyperactivity propagates to the medial prefrontal cortex, leading to autism-related social deficits.",Role of the Hippocampal-mPFC Pathway in Social Memory Deficits in Autism,9645277,R01MH118563,"['Affect ', ' Axon ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Genes ', ' glutamatergic ', ' L-Glutamate ', ' Glutamates ', ' Goals ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hippocampus ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Immunohistochemistry Staining Method ', ' Immunohistochemistry Cell/Tissue ', ' Immunohistochemistry ', ' Internuncial Neuron ', ' Internuncial Cell ', ' Intercalated Neurons ', ' Intercalary Neuron ', ' Connector Neuron ', ' Interneurons ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' Rett Disorder ', ' Cerebroatrophic Hyperammonemia ', ' Rett Syndrome ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' sociobehavior ', ' Social Behavior ', ' Social Interaction ', ' synapse ', ' Synaptic ', ' Synapses ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Rod-Opsin ', ' Opsin ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' Methyl-CpG-Binding Protein 2 ', ' Methyl-DNA binding protein MECP2 ', ' Methyl-CpG binding protein 2 ', ' Methyl CpG binding protein MeCP2 ', ' Methyl CpG Binding Protein 2 ', ' MeCP2 protein ', ' MeCP2 ', ' MeCP-2 protein ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Medial ', ' Distal ', ' Site ', ' Synaptic Potentials ', ' Long-Term Potentiation ', ' Longterm Potentiation ', ' Knockout Mice ', ' Null Mouse ', ' Knock-out Mice ', ' KO mice ', ' Link ', ' Fiber ', ' Memory impairment ', ' memory dysfunction ', ' Memory Deficit ', ' Confocal Microscopy ', ' Functional disorder ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Morphology ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Hyperactive behavior ', ' Motor Hyperactivity ', ' Hyperkinetic Movements ', ' Hyperkinesis ', ' Hyperkinesia ', ' Hyperactivity ', ' Contralateral ', ' System ', ' Membrane ', ' membrane structure ', ' cellular targeting ', ' Structure ', ' Cognitive deficits ', ' cognitive defects ', ' novel ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' Long-Term Depression ', ' longterm synaptic depression ', ' longterm depression ', ' Long-Term Synaptic Depression ', ' behavioral assessment ', ' Behavior assessment ', ' Symptoms ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' autistic spectrum disorder ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' Infantile Autism ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Autism ', ' Mutate ', ' in vivo ', ' Excitatory Synapse ', ' Slice ', ' Wild Type Mouse ', ' Knock-out ', ' Knockout ', ' Neurodevelopmental Disorder ', ' Neurological Development Disorder ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' hippocampal pyramidal neuron ', ' Pyramidal neuron ', ' network dysfunction ', ' Synaptic plasticity ', ' Impairment ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' behavioral impairment ', ' impaired behavior ', ' optogenetics ', ' cognitive task ', ' cognitive ability ', ' spatial memory ', ' designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs ', ' DREADDs ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' voltage sensitive dye ', ' potentiometric dye ', ' social deficits ', ' social dysfunction ', ' social disorders ', ' social defects ', ' postnatal development ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R01,2019,393603,AL-07,0.04020753302267829
"In vivo Imaging of Neuroactivity in the Deep Forward Scattering Regime Using Speckle Identification and Demixing (SPID) Microscopy PROJECT SUMMARY Optical imaging of neuronal activity in the mammalian brain at depth and at high spatial and temporal resolution remains a key challenge in neuroscience. This is because tissue scattering eliminates directional information carried by photons, with a characteristic length scale of hundreds of microns. As a result, the remaining unscattered, or “ballistic” component of light decays exponentially with depth. Since all optical microscopy modalities rely—either in the excitation or the emission—on this ballistic component of light for image formation, the limitations imposed by scattering limit the maximally obtainable imaging depths to ~1.5 mm in the rodent brain. Hereby, we propose a systematic approach for exploring and developing a new platform for in vivo deep tissue calcium imaging that actively exploits the scattering properties of the tissue as a resource to localize, demix and extract neuronal activity traces in the millimeter depth range in the highly scattering rodent brain. Our approach utilizes the fact that the scattering process results in an accumulation of different relative phases between scattered light components, leading to the formation of deterministic but complex interference patterns known as speckles. Emission from different locations of the sample results in speckles with different intensity distributions. Thus, these patterns carry complex information about both the location of the emitter and the properties of the scattering medium. Our current results show that the obtainable contrast for these speckle patterns should be sufficient to identify, localize and demix them even for extended objects and with partially coherent light. We will design and build an array of hardware and computational tools that will allow us to systematically explore the limits within which such demixing and neuronal signal extraction can be achieved in vivo. We will use these insights and develop an optical platform for volumetric calcium imaging in the mouse brain in the deep forward-scattering regime, as well as for transcranial calcium imaging in the mouse brain. Our approach will synergistically combine the expertise on the physics of light propagation in disordered media in the Gigan Lab with the experience in machine learning, computational imaging and in vivo high-speed volumetric neuronal recording in the Vaziri Lab. Our method has the potential of opening up a new paradigm for neuronal imagining and signal extraction in the multiple scattering regime by enabling millimeter-range calcium imaging in the highly scattering rodent brain. PROJECT NARRATIVE Optical recording of neuronal activity in the mammalian brain at depth with high spatial resolution remains, due to the highly scattering properties of brain tissue, a key challenge in neuroscience. This is because all microscopy modalities rely on the non-scattered ballistic component of light—which is exponentially attenuated with tissue depth—either in the excitation or the emission for image formation.

"CRCNS: US-Japan Research Proposal: The Computational Principles of a Neural Face Processing System There is a fundamental gap in our understanding of the computational principles and neural mechanisms by which neural circuits represent complex objects like faces. This conceptual gap constitutes an important problem because, until it is filled, we will not be able to understand face recognition and the reasons for face blindness. The long-term goal is to understand the computational principles and neural mechanisms of face recognition and create a computer face-recognition system based on these principles. The overall objective of this proposal is the determination of the computational principles of local and global face feature coding in the brain's face-processing network. The central hypothesis is that high-level feature tuning in face-selective areas can be understood as the result of the statistical properties of stimulus space and general organizational features of the circuits that process these stimuli. The rationale for this proposal is that completion of the proposed research will provide an understanding, of how neural circuits generate a meaningful representation of complex visual shape, imposing critical constraints on theories of vision. The hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims, which will determine 1) neural mechanism for facial feature tuning, 2) neural mechanism for categorical face selectivity, and 3) neural mechanisms for transformations of feature tuning. The joint computational and experimental approach will integrate functional magnetic resonance imaging to localize face areas with electrophysiological recordings targeted to these regions and computational analyses of model systems. The approach is innovative through the tight coupling of theoretical principles and experimental validation and by developing novel theoretical and experimental methodologies. The proposed research is significant, because it will unravel principles of neural circuit function that are of general relevance for understanding visual object recognition and multi-node networks. Because the outcome is an advance in understanding circuit mechanisms of social perception, it will identify vulnerabilities of the face-processing system directly relevant to the understanding of face blindness, prosopagnosia, and of altered social perception in syndromes spanning autism spectrum disorders, fragile X, and Williams syndrome. The proposed research is relevant to public health because the neural mechanisms of face processing are essential to human social life, and altered social perception is characteristic of many pervasive neurodevelopmental disorders. Studies proposed in this application will identify the computational principles of face recognition circuitry and suggest how alterations to these circuits impair function.

"Mechanisms of neural circuit dynamics in working memory anddecision-making Project Summary Working memory, the ability to temporarily hold multiple pieces of information in mind for manipulation, is central to virtually all cognitive abilities. Recent technical advances have opened an unprecedented opportunity to comprehensively dissect the neural circuit mechanisms of this ability across multiple brain areas. The task to be studied is a common form of decision-making that is based on the gradual accumulation of sensory evidence and thus relies on working memory. A team of leading experts propose to investigate the neural basis of this behavior using the latest techniques, including virtual reality, high-throughput automated behavioral training, large-scale cellular-resolution imaging in behaving rodents, manipulation of neural activity in specific brain areas and cell types, and automated anatomical reconstruction. In particular, the researchers will identify key brain regions that are required for this decision task through systematic, temporally specific inactivations via optogenetics technology, across all of dorsal cortex and in key subcortical areas, and use quantitative model-fitting to evaluate the effects. They will use state-of-the-art two-photon calcium imaging methods and electrophysiology to characterize the information flow in many individual neurons within these brain areas during the task. In addition, they will use cutting-edge anatomical reconstructions and new functional connectivity methods, within and across brain regions, to evaluate the interactions of these physiologically characterized neurons. The long-term goal of this project is to arrive at a complete, brain-wide understanding of the cellular and circuit mechanisms of activity dynamics related to working memory. Finally, they will use sophisticated computational methods to incorporate this new understanding into a realistic circuit model that will support a tightly integrated process of model-guided experimental design, in which the model suggests the most informative experiments and their results are then fed back to improve the model’s fidelity. This process is expected to produce the most accurate and detailed multi-brain-region biophysical circuit model of a cognitive process in existence. In addition, the proposed research will enable researchers to generate and test a variety of hypotheses about the neural basis of evidence accumulation, working memory, and decision-making. Taken together, these achievements will represent a crucial step toward a mechanistic understanding of how the brain works with information. Working memory, the capacity to temporarily hold multiple pieces of information in mind for manipulation , is central to almost all cognitive abilities. Many mental diseases, including Alzheimer’s, schizophrenia, dementia, bipolar depression, autism, and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, involve working memory. The major goal of this project is to determine how the brain produces decisions based on working memory, via a coordinated effort by multiple researchers to observe, map, perturb, and model brain circuits with state-of-the-art technologies, which will provide critical clues to therapeutic approaches and constitute a major advance in basic science.",Mechanisms of neural circuit dynamics in working memory anddecision-making,9778913,U19NS104648,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Animals ', ' Atlases ', ' Automation ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Behavior ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biophysics ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' Bipolar Depression ', ' bipolar depressed ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Calcium ', ' Cerebellum ', ' Cognition ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Decision Making ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Goals ', ' instrumentation ', ' Maps ', ' working memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Microscopy ', ' Molecular Probes ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' optical ', ' Optics ', ' Quality Control ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Support ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodent ', ' Running ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Ventral Tegmental Area ', ' ventral tegmentum ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Dorsal ', ' Area ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Training ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' Individual ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Collaborations ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Pulse ', ' Complex ', ' Sensory ', ' cell type ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' member ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' neural circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' virtual reality ', ' virtual world ', ' virtual environment ', ' VR simulation ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Hyperactivity Disorder NOS ', ' ADHD ', ' AD/HD ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' Brain region ', ' imaging method ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging modality ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' autistic spectrum disorder ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' Infantile Autism ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Autism ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' two-photon ', ' 2-photon ', ' reconstruction ', ' virtual ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' scale up ', ' Population ', ' Mind ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' network models ', ' information processing ', ' optogenetics ', ' cognitive process ', ' cognitive ability ', ' Data Science ', ' data to knowledge ', ' data into knowledge ', ' social computing ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' ']",NINDS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,U19,2019,3062362,NJ-12,-0.06249535405645809
"Generation of Human iPSC-derived Entorhinal Cortex Neurons for Probing Selective Neuronal Vulnerability in Alzheimer's Disease In early phases of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) only specific types of neurons are affected by pathological lesions. As the disease progresses, additional neurons types gradually start expressing signs of pathology and degeneration throughout the brain. A major obstacle to treating Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is our lack of understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying this selective neuronal vulnerability. Neurons from the layer II of the entorhinal cortex (ECII) are the most vulnerable neurons of the brain, but there are currently no in vitro culture system for these neurons, preventing both an in-depth analysis of genes involved in neuronal vulnerability, and the search for drugs inhibiting early neurodegeneration affecting these neurons. In the parent RF1 grant, we proposed to identify transcription factors (TFs) involved in specifying ECII neuron identity, using both detailed molecular profiles for ECII and control neurons, which we generated at different points of their development, and cutting-edge functional genomics analyses. These TFs will then be used to drive the differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) into ECII neurons. While iPSCs provide a versatile platform that can be differentiated into many different neuron types, concerns have been raised that neurons derived from iPSCs are biologically very young, as the iPSC generation protocol “resets” the biological clock of a cell. AD-associated lesions are age-dependent, and we think that an in vitro paradigm adapted to this study of aging is crucial. In this administrative supplement, we thus want to adapt this iPSC protocol for the direct reprogramming of human fibroblasts, using the TFs identified in the parent grant. Directly reprogrammed fibroblasts are not reset biologically and present a biological age that correlates with the age of the fibroblast donor. After having optimized a protocol for direct reprogramming of fibroblasts into ECII neurons, we will provide a proof of concept that these ECII neurons are a good model for probing selective neuronal vulnerability by studying Tau pathology in neurons reprogrammed from fibroblasts of aging donors and of donors with AD mutations. Overall these ECII neurons directly reprogrammed from fibroblasts would be the first in vitro model for the study of the interplay between selective neuronal vulnerability in AD and aging. In Alzheimer’s diseases (AD), only certain regions of the brain are initially affected, followed later by more wide-ranging degeneration. In our parent grant, we proposed to establish the first cell culture system to model the neurons that are most vulnerable in AD, using stem cells. It was recently shown that culture systems involving stem cells generate cells that are young biologically, and not perfectly suited for the study of age- associated degeneration. We now propose to modify our initial protocol using “fibroblast direct reprogramming”, a protocol that does not involve stem cells, and that yields cells than can be biologically much older. This cell culture system would allow AD researchers to investigate, for the first time, the interaction between age and neuronal vulnerability to AD.",Generation of Human iPSC-derived Entorhinal Cortex Neurons for Probing Selective Neuronal Vulnerability in Alzheimer's Disease,9791605,RF1AG054564,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Biological Clocks ', ' internal clock ', ' body clock ', ' Biologic Clock ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' striatal ', ' Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Fibroblasts ', ' Genes ', ' Grant ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' In Vitro ', ' Study models ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' neurological degeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' Parents ', ' Pathology ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Progenitor Cells ', ' Stem cells ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' transcription factor ', ' Generations ', ' τ Proteins ', ' tau factor ', ' tau ', ' microtubule-bound tau ', ' microtubule bound tau ', ' MT-bound tau ', ' tau Proteins ', ' entorhinal cortex ', ' Entorhinal Area ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Subfamily lentivirinae ', ' Virus-Lenti ', ' Lentivirus ', ' Lentivirinae ', ' Lesion ', ' Individual ', ' presenilin-1 ', ' presenilin 1 protein ', ' S182 protein ', ' PSEN1 ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Event ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' System ', ' mutant ', ' transcription factor S-II ', ' transcription factor IIS ', ' transcription elongation factor S-II ', ' transcription elongation factor A ', ' strand transfer protein alpha ', ' elongation factor SII ', ' TFIIS elongation factor ', ' TFIIS ', ' SII transcription elongation factor ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' functional genomics ', ' Brain region ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Administrative Supplement ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' molecular signature ', ' molecular profile ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' in vitro Model ', ' Cell Culture System ', ' Pathologic ', ' Monitor ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' stem cell differentiation ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' neurofibrillary tangle formation ', ' tangle formation ', ' aged ', ' abeta accumulation ', ' aβ aggregation ', ' aβ accumulation ', ' amyloid β aggregation ', ' amyloid β accumulation ', ' amyloid beta aggregation ', ' amyloid beta accumulation ', ' abeta aggregation ', ' induced pluripotent stem cell ', ' iPSCs ', ' iPSC ', ' iPS ', ' age related neurodegeneration ', ' age-related\xa0neurodegenerative disease ', ' age-related neurodegenerative disorder ', ' parent grant ', ' overexpression ', ' overexpress ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' ']",NIA,ROCKEFELLER UNIVERSITY,RF1,2019,423750,NY-12,-0.043719841949449674
"Building analysis tools and a theory framework for inferring principles of neural computation from multi-scale organization in brain recordings Summary The BRAIN initiative is enabling ground-breaking techniques for brain recordings that will permit a unique view onto the dynamics of neural activity. However, inferring brain function from multi-channel physiological recordings is challenging. A key difficulty is that individual neurons and mesoscopic, often rhythmic, cell populations interact in complicated and recurrent ways. Such complex neuronal dynamics is hard to analyze but very likely important to the functioning of the brain. This proposal will address this problem by developing (1) tools for analyzing brain activity; (2) a theoretical framework for expressing underlying computations and generating experimental predictions. The starting point of the project is our earlier discovery that phase structure in oscillatory local field potentials (LFP) of hippocampal areas CA1/CA3 carry location information in exquisite detail (Agarwal et al. 2014). We will release software tools that make the methods for phase decoding and extracting meaningful LFP components available to the broader community. Further, in collaboration with experimental labs we will research the mechanistic underpinnings of this discovery in hippocampus (Buzsaki NYU, Foster, UC Berkeley), and explore how similar approaches can leverage phase diversity in cortical gamma oscillations (Fries, MPI Frankfurt). The research goal is to develop analysis tools for decoding and extraction of functional components (Aims 1 and 2), applicable to a broad range of multivariate brain recordings of hippocampal and cortical activity. Further, we will develop a flexible two-level theory framework with software tools (Aim 3) to help neuroscientists, in particular experimenters, to formulate putative abstract computations underlying a brain function under study, and build a concrete mechanistic circuit model of those computations. The computational description level will leverage ideas of vector symbolic architectures, a class of connectionist models originally proposed for describing cognitive reasoning (Plate, 1995; Kanerva, 1996). Models produced by the software tool will concisely encapsulate assumptions about the computation and its implementation of a brain function and produce predictions that can be tested in a next generation of recording experiments. The proposed theory framework will be tested in building models for navigation in hippocampus and for visual processing in areas V1 and V4 in cortex. Project narrative: A key difficulty with inferring brain function from recordings of neural activity in a working brain is that the dynamics of individual neurons and mesoscopic, often rhythmic, cell populations interact in complicated and recurrent ways. Here we address this problem by delivering new tools for decoding and decomposing neural population activity, leveraging the recent discovery by the PI of behavior-specific phase structure of local field potentials. Further, we provide software and a theoretical framework for describing models of brain function on a computational and mechanistic level that can produce testable predictions for a new generation of brain recording experiments.",Building analysis tools and a theory framework for inferring principles of neural computation from multi-scale organization in brain recordings,9789876,R01EB026955,"['Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Communities ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Electrodes ', ' Goals ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hippocampus ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Monkeys ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Periodicity ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Rat ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Rattus ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Software Tools ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Traction ', ' Utah ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' visual cortical ', ' Visual Cortex ', ' Generations ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Encapsulated ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' visual processing ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Structure ', ' Modality ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Modeling ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' theories ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' vector ', ' data modeling ', ' modeling of the data ', ' model the data ', ' model of data ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' independent component analysis ', ' area V1 ', ' area V4 ', ' Population ', ' presynaptic ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' operation ', ' BRAIN initiative ', ' model building ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' high dimensionality ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' ']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2019,350717,CA-13,0.025376289566422804
"The Nanoscale Connectome of the Cochlear Nucleus The cochlear nucleus is the gateway for central nervous system processing of auditory information in mammals. It has been proposed that parallel processing channels are set up in the CN, and these form the basis for further computation at higher stations of the auditory system. Despite decades of study, enumeration of CN cell types is incomplete and CN circuitry is described only superficially. In neuroscience generally, classification and naming of neurons has relied primarily upon qualitative approaches based upon human observational capabilities. We have implemented and in some cases developed novel high-throughput and unbiased techniques for labeling, segmenting and classifying neurons in 3D, generated from large-scale electron microscopy image volumes. We propose to deliver a nanoscale map, or connectome, of the mouse CN with enumerated and localized cell types and their synaptic connections. This effort is unbiased because all neurons will be sampled. To achieve this goal, we bring together four parallel modes of tissue analysis for neuron classification: morphology, connectivity, molecular identity and function. We propose that connectivity analysis will define long-proposed parallel processing circuits that will be tested functionally using realistic biophysical models of identified cell types. Notably, the cochlear nucleus contains both amorphous and layered organizations of cells, which serve as templates for all other brain regions. By investigating the fundamental structure of this sensory center, we will establish principles of neural computation and methods for structural and functional phenotyping that will apply to other brain regions regardless of their particular neural architecture. Relevance to Public Health The goal of this project is to deliver to the auditory research community the connectome of the mouse cochlear nucleus. In the process we will refine and develop comprehensive and high throughput methods to catalogue cell types and their connections in any brain region, and will provide molecular phenotypes for cochlear nucleus cell types that may be useful in their targeted manipulation for research and therapeutic purposes.

"Deciphering the building blocks of hippocampal circuits   Abstract   Since  Ramon  y  Cajal,  neuroscientists  have  speculated  that  even  the  most  complex  brain  functions  might  eventually be understood at the level of neuronal cell types and their connections. Unfortunately, our under‐ standing of the brain's extensive diversity of cell types and elaborate circuitry remains far from complete. For  example, despite the hippocampus being essential for learning and memory and its dysfunction underlying a  wide variety of devastating neuropsychiatric disorders, we still lack fundamental knowledge about its constit‐ uent cell types and their molecular profiles and connectivity, slowing progress towards a mechanistic circuit‐ level understanding of memory formation. We propose to identify all of the interneuron cell types in area CA1  of the hippocampus and decipher their canonical connectivity. We have assembled a strong interdisciplinary  team  capable  of  combining  cutting‐edge  technologies  including  high‐throughput  multi‐cell  patch  recordings,  morphological reconstructions, single‐cell RNA sequencing, and machine learning to achieve two main goals:  1) dissect CA1 microcircuit organization by generating a morphological and electrophysiological taxonomy of  all interneuron cell types in mouse CA1 and map their connections; and 2) derive transcriptomic signatures of  morphologically defined CA1 interneurons using our newly developed Patch‐seq method. Our team recently  implemented  this  interdisciplinary  experimental  strategy  to  successfully  identify  cell  types  in  the  neocortex  and dissect their microcircuitry. Using multi‐cell patch clamp recording, we will characterize the electrophysi‐ ological properties, morphology, laminar location and connectivity of thousands of neurons from mouse CA1  hippocampus. We will also utilize a new, highly sensitive, cost effective technique for single‐cell RNA sequenc‐ ing (Smart‐seq2) to map their transcriptomes and machine learning techniques to classify cells into molecular  types.  Importantly,  our  high‐throughput  method  will  allow  us  to  obtain  morphological,  electrophysiological  and  complete  transcriptome  information  for  single  neurons,  which  cannot  be  achieved  using  other  methods  such as dissociating tissue for single‐cell sequencing. In‐house customization and automation has reduced our  sequencing costs, enabling us to sequence thousands of cells within a reasonable budget. Cell type identifica‐ tion will be validated using morphological, electrophysiological, and molecular tests. Identifying all of the in‐ terneuron  cell  types  that  comprise  CA1  and  determining  how  they  connect  to  each  other  will  have  a  broad,  paradigm‐shifting impact. For instance, it will contribute to a circuit‐level understanding of the computations  that take place in CA1, such as memory formation. From a clinical perspective, single‐cell transcriptome data  will yield a powerful atlas to investigate relationships between cell types and genes related to neuropsychiatric  diseases and facilitate cell‐type engineering.       Narrative  The  hippocampus  is  a  complex  brain  structure  that  mediates  remarkable  mental  functions  like  learning  and  memory, while its malfunction is associated with devastating neuropsychiatric diseases including Alzheimer's

"The Role of Neuronal Ensembles Supporting Auditory Fear Conditioning (Engrams) in the Amygdala in Memory Formation, Generalization and Extinction Project Summary/Abstract Memory may be defined as the retention over time of internal representations gained through experience, and the capacity to reconstruct these representations at later times (Dudai 2007). These internal representations are thought to be encoded by long-lasting physical brain changes (memory traces or `engrams') (Josselyn, Kohler & Frankland 2015, 2017; Tonegawa et al. 2015; Schacter 2001). Remembering fear-evoking events is adaptive; it helps one make future choices based on past experience. It may even be beneficial to generalize some fearful memories. However, excessive fear generalization or treating no-longer threatening stimuli as dangerous may be maladaptive. Indeed, recurrent or inappropriately expressed fearful memories are a major component of several psychiatric diseases, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety. Therefore, understanding how memory traces for fearful events are formed, change over time, under what conditions they remain specific or generalize, and how they are impacted by behavioral extinction are critical questions to not only understanding how the brain uses information but also for informing the development of new treatment/prevention strategies for disorders characterized by inappropriate fear memories. Here two PIs (Drs. Josselyn and Frankland), both New Investigators, will combine their expertise to address these important questions. Because all techniques are associated with caveats and limitations, we will use a variety of techniques including optogenetic manipulation, brain-wide neuronal activity mapping and the use of graph-theory to produce “engram maps” and real time in vivo calcium imaging combined with behavior. Together, the ability to manipulate and observe an engram as it forms, changes over time and with behavioral extinction is innovative and may lead to a shift in the very definition of an engram, as well as increase our understanding for developing treatments aimed at resolving inappropriate fear memories. Project Narrative More effective treatment approaches for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or other anxiety disorders will be facilitated by better understanding how the brain forms memory traces supporting fear memories, how these change over time and with extinction.","The Role of Neuronal Ensembles Supporting Auditory Fear Conditioning (Engrams) in the Amygdala in Memory Formation, Generalization and Extinction",9713394,R01MH119421,"['Amygdaloid structure ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdala ', ' Anxiety ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Calcium ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Dangerousness ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Endoscopes ', ' behavioral extinction ', ' Extinction ', ' Extinction (Psychology) ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' Freezing ', ' Future ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hippocampus ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Maps ', ' Memory ', ' Microscopy ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' mRNA ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' PTSD ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' training module ', ' Training Activity ', ' General Viruses ', ' Virus ', ' Halorhodopsin Chromoprotein ', ' Halorhodopsins ', ' Rod-Opsin ', ' Opsin ', ' Mediating ', ' promotor ', ' promoter ', ' Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization ', ' Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization ', ' FISH assay ', ' FISH analysis ', ' FISH Technique ', ' FISH Technic ', ' base ', ' Lateral ', ' Immediate-Early Genes ', ' Training ', ' Stimulus ', ' Auditory ', ' Event ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Nuclear ', ' experience ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Address ', ' conditioned fear ', ' fear conditioning ', ' Data ', ' Retrieval ', ' Wild Type Mouse ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' neuronal excitability ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' treatment strategy ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' optogenetics ', ' fear memory ', ' memory consolidation ', ' graph theory ', ' in vivo calcium imaging ', ' In vivo two-photon calcium imaging ', ' recruit ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' analysis pipeline ', ' ']",NIMH,HOSPITAL FOR SICK CHLDRN (TORONTO),R01,2019,355558,,0.055783606203512644
"Intelligent connectomic analysis tool for dense neuronal circuits Intelligent Connectomic Analysis Tool for Dense Neuronal Circuits Project Summary: The lack of basic understanding of neuronal functions and disease processes is a big factor of failures in creating drugs for neurological diseases. High-resolution maps of the complex connectivity of neuronal circuits correlating with functional and/or molecular markers offer invaluable insights into the functional organization of the neuronal structures, which is a key to understanding the brain in health and disease. There is a strong interest in elucidating and quantifying the connectomics of brain networks with subcellular resolution using electron microscopy (EM) and correlate with functional fluorescence microscopy data. The ultimate goal is to elucidate human brain functions and the mechanisms of human brain disorders. This is critically important to enable new diagnostics and therapies for brain disorders.  The reconstruction and analyses of neuronal networks is challenging in part due to the joint requirement of large volume and high resolution and a large gap in connectomic analysis solutions. There is a strong need for next generation, well supported, integrated, easy to use and highly automated analysis tools to detect and classify neurons, trace arbor branches, identify synapses, spines and synaptic vesicles that increase the throughput of otherwise prohibitively time-consuming analyses in connectomic experiments. There is also a strong need for tools to perform downstream data-driven analysis such as functional inference from structure and phenotypic discovery.  Powered by machine learning and DRVision innovations and collaborating with Dr. Rachel Wong and 9 additional labs, this project proposes to create an intelligent connectomic analysis (ICA) tool optimized for dense neuronal circuits. The tool will be commercially supported and integrated with DRVision’s flagship product Aivia to (1) provide accurate and automated neuron tracing in 3D EM and 3D fluorescence data up to multi-terabytes, (2) identify pre- and post-synaptic dendrite segments, (3) correlate light and electron microscopy data, quantify and classify neurons and sub-cellular components, (4) extract and analyze neuron circuits, (5) provide tools for phenotype discoveries, (6) seamlessly integrate the pipeline of ground truth (GT) annotation, editing, and machine learning workflow, and (7) access the required computing infrastructure, database connection, and exchange of data with other tools.

"Deciphering the building blocks of the macaque prefrontal cortical microcircuit Abstract Since Ramon y Cajal, neuroscientists have speculated that even the most complex brain functions might even- tually be understood at the level of neuronal cell types and their connections. More recently, while we have be- gun to understand the wiring principles of cortical microcircuit in rodents at the level of cell types, we are still in infancy in understanding the circuit organization of the primate neocortex at the level of cell types and their connections, slowing the progress toward a mechanistic understanding of complex cognitive capabilities char- acteristic of primates. For instance, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) of the primate brain is the most evolutionarily developed brain region that supports complex cognitive processes characteristic of primates, such as reasoning, planning, and abstract thinking. However, we know little about the constituent cell types comprising DLPFC circuit, how each cell type connects each other to form a functional circuit, and what circuit components specific to this circuit endow it with superb computational capabilities for complex cognitive pro- cesses. To fill in this knowledge gap, we scale up a cost-effective, interdisciplinary approach to macaque DLPFC, aiming at identifying all its consitiuent cell types and decipher their connectivity rules, with emphasis on highly diverse GABAergic interneurons. We propose to use multi-cell patch recordings, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), novel and rapid viral GABAergic labeling, and machine learning to achieve two main goals: 1) dissect macaque DLPFC microcircuit by generating a morphological taxonomy of cell types in DLPFC and mapping their connections; and 2) derive transcriptomic signatures of morphologically defined DLPFC neurons using Patch-seq method, a novel scRNA-seq protocol. We have demonstrated the feasibility and suc- cess of this approach in mouse neocortex, and our preliminary data indicate no technical issue in applying this approach to primates. Using multi-cell patch recordings, we will characterize electrophysiology and morphology of thousands of neurons and map connections between tens of thousands of cell pairs from DLPFC. Using Patch-seq method, we will combine patch recording with a novel/sensitive scRNA-seq method (Smart-seq2) to simultaneously obtain electrophysiology, morphology and transcriptome from single neurons, which can further substantiate cell type classification and identify novel molecular markers for each cell type. We will prioritize our effort on superficial layers of DLPFC, but eventually scale up our efforts to all layers if time permits. At the end, the project will uncover a high-resolution microcircuit blueprint of macaque DLPFC with each circuit com- ponent identified by specific genetic markers. Such a comprehensive dataset will provide the essential ground- work to design molecular tools for further functional dissection of the complex cognitive processes subserved by PFC. From a clinical perspective, having reference transcriptomes and connectivity patterns for different cell types in primate DLPFC will facilitate our understanding of the relationship between disease-associated genes, cell types, and circuit deficits in neuropsychiatric diseases, schizophrenia in particular. Narrative The prefrontal cortex (PFC) of the primate is the most evolutionarily developed brain structure mediating complex cognitive functions characteristic of primates, such as reasoning and planning, while its malfunction is associated with devastating neuropsychiatric diseases including schizophrenia, depression, and Alzheimer disease. Despite its vital importance, we currently know very little about the constituent cell types populating the primate PFC and how they are wired together to mediate complex cognitive functions characteristic of primates. We propose to use a cost-efficient, multidisciplinary approach to decipher the cell type-specific wiring principles of the monkey PFC circuit at an unprecedented scale and level of detail, which could lead to a better circuit-level mechanistic understanding of complex functions subserved by primate PFC and more effective strategies for the treatment of devastating disorders, such as schizophrenia.",Deciphering the building blocks of the macaque prefrontal cortical microcircuit,9802062,R01MH120404,"[""Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Felis sylvestris catus ', ' Felis domesticus ', ' Felis domestica ', ' Feline Species ', ' Domestic Cats ', ' Cats Mammals ', ' Cats ', ' Felis catus ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Decision Making ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Dissection ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' genetic biomarker ', ' Genetic Markers ', ' Goals ', ' gun ', ' Guns ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' In Vitro ', ' Internuncial Neuron ', ' Internuncial Cell ', ' Intercalated Neurons ', ' Intercalary Neuron ', ' Connector Neuron ', ' Interneurons ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Macaque ', ' Macaca ', ' Maps ', ' working memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Monkeys ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' Perception ', ' Primates Mammals ', ' Primates ', ' Research ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodent ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Testing ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Time ', ' General Viruses ', ' Virus ', ' Work ', ' Mediating ', ' General Taxonomy ', ' Taxonomy ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' Neocortex ', ' neopallium ', ' isocortex ', ' homotypical cortex ', ' Label ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' infancy ', ' infantile ', ' Genetic ', ' Morphology ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' cognitive function ', ' Complex ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' Viral ', ' interest ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Physical shape ', ' morphological signature ', ' morphological criteria ', ' morphologic signature ', ' morphologic criteria ', ' Morphologic Finding ', ' Property ', ' Brain region ', ' ward ', ' Homologous Gene ', ' Homologue ', ' Homolog ', ' GeneHomolog ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Classification Scheme ', ' Cognitive ', ' Scheme ', ' Cellular Morphology ', ' cell morphology ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' Behavioral ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' transcriptional signature ', ' gene expression signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' Expression Signature ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' scale up ', ' cost effective ', ' cost efficient ', ' transcriptomics ', ' neocortical ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' treatment strategy ', ' molecular marker ', ' molecular biomarker ', ' cognitive process ', ' cognitive capacity ', ' cortex mapping ', ' cortical mapping ', ' cortical map ', ' transcriptome ', ' global transcription profile ', ' global gene expression ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' high dimensionality ', ' Injections ', ' preservation ', ' single-cell RNA sequencing ', ' single cell RNA-seq ', ' scRNA-seq ', ' ']",NIMH,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,399688,TX-09,-0.05470351722025434
"Hippocampal and prefrontal contributions to memory integration PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Hippocampus (HPC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) structure and connectivity continue to develop through childhood and adolescence, developmental periods that are associated with substantial gains in memory and cognitive ability. While such structural changes are well documented, we know little about the functions that HPC and PFC development confer, fundamentally limiting our understanding of the mechanisms of cognitive development. The overarching goal of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that the representational capacity of the HPC—PFC memory circuit transforms across development from a system that stores individual memories in childhood to a mature system in adulthood wherein cognitive maps represent the relationships among multiple episodes. Cognitive maps allow memory to extend beyond direct experience by coding unobserved relationships among multiple events. In the absence of a mature HPC—PFC system, such knowledge extension through cognitive map formation may be limited in children and adolescents, and therefore result in development differences in learning, decision making, and reasoning behaviors that require consideration of the relationships among multiple events. Moreover, the differential time course of HPC and PFC development, in which mature HPC function may emerge earlier than that of PFC, suggests there may be distinct patterns of memory representation and behavior in adolescence that differ from both childhood and adulthood. To answer these open questions, the proposed studies use a combination of high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and sophisticated multivariate pattern analyses in children (7-9 years), younger adolescents (10-12 years), older adolescents (13-15 years), and adults (25-30 years). Using these methods, we will quantify: (1) age-related differences in HPC—PFC memory integration and separation strategies that support cognitive map formation and (2) how developmental differences in neural representation impact temporal (Aim 1), spatial (Aim 2), and event memory (Aim 3). Collectively, the results from this project will provide a key test of fundamental theories of cognitive development and substantially advance our knowledge of the representational capacities of the HPC—PFC memory system at different ages. In doing so, the findings have the potential to inform interventions designed to enhance memory and reasoning abilities that rely on cognitive maps, including in individuals diagnosed with mental health or neurodevelopmental disorders associated with memory deficits (e.g., autism, depression, Fragile X, or schizophrenia). . PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The proposed research investigates how development of hippocampus and prefrontal cortex the human brain supports memory and reasoning during childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. A growing body of empirical work has shown that difficulties with memory and reasoning in development are associated with poor academic outcomes, as well as with several mental health disorders with developmental onsets, including autism, depression, Fragile X, and schizophrenia. Isolating the neural mechanisms that underlie changes in memory and reasoning ability from childhood to adulthood may thus help identify markers of atypical development and contribute to interventions that may improve both cognitive and academic outcomes.",Hippocampal and prefrontal contributions to memory integration,9736791,R01MH100121,"['Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Decision Making ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Environment ', ' mental retardation-macroorchidism syndrome ', ' marker X syndrome ', ' mar(X) syndrome ', ' macro-orchidism-marker X syndrome ', ' macro-orchidism-marker X (MOMX) syndrome ', ' fragile site mental retardation 1 ', ' fragile Xq syndrome ', ' fragile X-mental retardation syndrome ', ' fra(X)(q27-28) syndrome ', ' fra(X)(q27) syndrome ', ' fra(X)(28) syndrome ', ' fra(X) syndrome ', ' autism-fragile X syndrome ', ' autism-fragile X (AFRAX) syndrome ', ' X-linked mental retardation-fragile site 1 syndrome ', ' X-linked mental retardation with fragile X syndrome ', ' X-linked mental deficiency-megalotestes syndrome ', ' Renpenning syndrome 2 ', ' Martin-Bell-Renpenning syndrome ', ' Martin-Bell Syndrome ', ' Fragile X ', ' Escalante syndrome ', ' Fragile X Syndrome ', ' Goals ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hippocampus ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Influentials ', ' Learning ', ' Maps ', ' Memory ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Research ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' improved ', ' Anterior ', ' Medial ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Memory impairment ', ' memory dysfunction ', ' Memory Deficit ', ' Individual ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Knowledge ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' experience ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' virtual reality ', ' virtual world ', ' virtual environment ', ' VR simulation ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' autistic spectrum disorder ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' Infantile Autism ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Autism ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Retrieval ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Neurodevelopmental Disorder ', ' Neurological Development Disorder ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' Outcome ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' spatial integration ', ' public health relevance ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' cognitive development ', ' cognitive ability ', ' spatial memory ', ' ']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R01,2019,661398,TX-10,0.028618594214825557
"Encoding Precise Behavioral Features of Anxiety by Cortico-BNST Ensembles PROJECT SUMMARY Maladaptive behaviors are a staple of anxiety disorders, yet how specific neural populations drive these behav- iors is unclear. Despite the high prevalence of anxiety disorders and their devastating burden, truly effective therapeutics are still lacking; understanding the underlying pathophysiology is critical. This is not a trivial feat considering the multitude of regions involved and the complexity of associated behaviors. The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is one region highly implicated in governing adaptive and pathological anxiety states, and medial prefrontal cortical (mPFC) neurons are known to regulate motivated behaviors, including those re- lated to anxiety. How mPFC directly modulates BNST activity in anxiety states though is not known. Therefore, the objective of this proposal is to study how mPFC neurons that project to BNST engage in anxiety-related behaviors. Experiments will employ contemporary tools to study the precise neurocircuitry during expression of specific anxiety-related phenotypes. First, in rodent models, anxiety-related behaviors will be identified in the presence of an anxiogenic stimulus using recently developed computer vision and machine learning tools that define behaviors from subsecond modules (Aim 1.1). This is a highly quantitative approach to analyze behavior that will track commonly studied behaviors and, importantly, novel behaviors that have been overlooked in the literature. Second, the role of BNST-projecting mPFC neurons in anxiety-related behaviors will be assessed using inhibitory and excitatory optogenetics in combination with the previously described behavioral analysis (Aim 1.2). This neural population will be targeted using new viral strategies that allow for projection specific targeting. Finally, the physiological neural dynamics of these mPFC neurons during the expression of anxiety- related behaviors will be visualized using mountable, miniature microscopes in mice expressing the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6s (Aim 2). This activity will be assessed with concurrent behavioral module recording to understand the neuronal dynamics during anxiety-related behaviors. Collectively, these experiments will determine how BNST-projecting mPFC neurons govern expression of the wide gamut of anxiety-related behaviors. Further, the culmination of this study and studies across the neuroscientific community will bear a clearer understanding of how anxiety-related behaviors arise in mental illnesses and will drive development of promising therapeutics. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal is relevant to public health because understanding the neural pathways that contribute to anxiety- related behaviors will drive understanding of its etiology and development of more effective therapeutics.

"The interactive roles of the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex during reversal learning As animals move about in the environment, they must be able to rapidly assess and update the meaning of cues around them in order to approach reward and avoid danger. Reversal learning, a paradigm commonly used to test behavioral flexibility, involves switching the association between a stimulus and its outcome. For example, a tone that initially predicted a sweet tastant can come to predict a bitter tastant. Two brain regions, the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and basolateral amygdala (BLA), are involved in tasks that demand flexible responses to the changing significance of stimuli during reversal learning. While several studies have provided evidence that the OFC and BLA interact during reversal learning, little is known about the specific mechanisms of this interaction. In this grant, we propose to use a combination of genetic and cellular imaging techniques in mice to identify and characterize the physiological response properties during reversal learning of BLA neurons that project to OFC. The reversal learning task we employ involves stimuli of multiple modalities that predict outcomes of both positive and negative value to thoroughly elucidate the differential response properties of BLA neurons to stimuli that change their associated reinforcement outcome (Aim 1). In these experiments, the physiological response properties of neurons identified as projecting from BLA to OFC will be compared to the response properties of the overall population. Then, using an optogenetic approach, we will test the causal role of OFC input onto BLA neurons during reversal learning by inhibiting the specific projections from OFC to BLA to test their causal role on behavioral flexibility and on the nature of representations in BLA (Aim 2). The data analysis for both aims involves collaboration with theoretical neuroscientists to use linear classifiers and other sophisticated techniques to understand the nature and dynamics of neural encoding in BLA and its relation to behavior. These experiments promise to shed light on the mechanisms by which cortico-amygdalar circuits mediate flexibility critical for adaptive emotional responses and behavior, an ability that is impaired in individuals with psychiatric disorders. This grant investigates the dynamic interactions between orbitofrontal cortex and the amygdala during a reversal learning task involving both rewarding and aversive outcomes. The study promises to elucidate mechanisms fundamental to the flexible updating of emotional behavior, mechanisms that likely become dysfunctional in psychiatric disorders.",The interactive roles of the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex during reversal learning,9676583,R21MH116348,"['Amygdaloid structure ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdala ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Animals ', ' Desire for food ', ' Appetite ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Calcium ', ' Cues ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Dissection ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Genetic Technics ', ' Genetic Techniques ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Head ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Learning ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Maintenance ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' Patients ', ' Quinine ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Research ', ' Reversal Learning ', ' Rewards ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' PTSD ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Saccharose ', ' Sucrose ', ' Testing ', ' General Viruses ', ' Virus ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' Functional disorder ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Auditory ', ' Sensory ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Performance ', ' virus genetics ', ' Viral Genetics ', ' fluorophore ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Structure ', ' expectation ', ' behavior test ', ' behavioral test ', ' Modality ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Emotional ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' Brain region ', ' Behavioral Mechanisms ', ' behavior mechanism ', ' Mechanisms of Behavior and Behavior Change ', ' Data ', ' Update ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cellular imaging ', ' cell imaging ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' two-photon ', ' 2-photon ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Impairment ', ' neurotoxic ', ' Implant ', ' lens ', ' lenses ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' optogenetics ', ' genetic approach ', ' emotional behavior ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' anatomic imaging ', ' anatomical imaging ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' ']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2019,243000,NY-13,0.023914940083650832
"CRCNS: Sensory-Motor Integration in Mammalian Brian: experiment, analysis, modeling A major goal facing organisms acting in the natural world is the selection of appropriate actions based on sensory information and prior knowledge accumulated through previous experience. Understanding how neural networks process information and control such actions requires a breakthrough both in large scale chronic data collection methods during behavioral tasks and in the development of new analysis and modeling tools that will be able to capture the dynamics and organization of such neural networks. To address key questions in the context of sensory-motor control and learning we propose a multidisciplinary approach that will synergize the expertise of the four groups involved in cellular and systems neuroscience, machine learning, signal processing, control theory and modeling. Our goal is to establish an empirically-grounded systems-level model explaining the interaction and integration within the sensory-motor system during behavioral tasks, which is consistent with the experimental data, and which provides concrete predictions for future experiments. More specifically, we intend to further our understanding on two main fronts. First, study cell type specific components that participate in the movement command and in sensory-motor error prediction. We hypothesize that layer 2-3 neurons subserve different roles from layer 5 neurons, and may be more strongly involved in error estimation rather than in control. Second, we intend to investigate whether and how the sensory and motor ends change in order to adapt to the new learned task. Here again we expect differences between the different cortical layers. Such a framework will not only provide new insights into the specific investigated system, but could be transferrable more generally to probe the structure and functionality of complex biological networks. In addition, the unique analysis methods developed and the deep understanding of biological sensory-motor systems may contribute invaluably to fields such as robotics and network control, and to the development of new prosthetics approaches within the field of Brain Computer Interfaces. RELEVANCE (See instructions): The goals of this research proposal are expected to provide novel insight on sensory-motor control as well as structural and functional plasticity processes of the cortical network during sensory-motor learning. Deep understanding of sensory-motor systems will aid in development of new treatment modalities for diseases that impair motor function, such as Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases.

"Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles Anxiety and related disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), are leading causes of global disability. Brain circuit abnormalities have been identified, but important knowledge gaps remain. It is unclear which abnormalities underlie what symptom profiles, how dysfunction develops and thus which brain abnormalities to target with new interventions. Moreover, circuit abnormalities likely cut across traditional diagnostic categories and, within a diagnostic category, there is individual variability. Our approach is to identify reproducible brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms; these brain signatures can then be used to reveal trans-diagnostic disease dimensions, to chart their development, and to develop treatments that target these circuit abnormalities directly.  The goal of this proposal is to identify reproducible brain signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD. To accomplish this, we will study 250 unmedicated OCD and 250 healthy control subjects (HCs) at five expert research sites spanning five countries (U.S., Brazil, India, Netherlands, and South Africa). Using imaging methods that could ultimately be adapted for clinical use, we will examine multiple brain circuits thought to underlie OCD behaviors, focusing on morphometry (using T1- weighted MRI), structural connectivity (using Diffusion Tensor Imaging [DTI]), and functional connectivity (using resting-state fMRI [rs-fMRI]). We will identify neuroimaging signatures that distinguish individuals with OCD from HCs by analyzing each modality with standardized protocols and by using multi-modal fusion with modern machine learning statistical methods. We will then examine how these imaging signatures are linked to behavioral performance on cognitive tasks that probe these same circuits and to a range of clinical profiles that are common to OCD. Finally, we will explore how specific environmental features (childhood trauma, socioeconomic status, religiosity) may moderate this brain-behavior relationship. Our short-term goal is to identify brain signatures of OCD cognitive and clinical profiles, leveraging our global collaboration both to recruit a very large unmedicated sample and to prove these signatures' reproducibility. Our long-term goal is to identify brain signatures for measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms that cut across traditional diagnostic categories and to use these signatures to transform how we conceptualize, diagnose and ultimately treat mental illnesses like OCD. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a prevalent and disabling disorder, and fewer than half of OCD patients become well with current treatments. This study seeks to identify reproducible neuroimaging signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD and that transcend countries/cultures. Identifying brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms will provide robust new treatment targets and help pave the way to precision psychiatry where individual brain signatures can help guide treatment choices.  ",Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles,9692060,R01MH113250,"['Anxiety Disorders ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Disorders ', '

"Defining the role of a prefrontal-midbrain circuit in exploratory behavior ABSTRACT Investigating how neural circuits mediate natural behavior is a critical to our understanding of the brain. Exploratory behaviors are necessary for rodent survival in the natural world and ubiquitous in freely-moving rodent experiments. One neural circuit that may mediate natural exploratory behaviors are the projections from prelimbic cortex (PL, part of rodent prefrontal cortex) to ventral tegmental area (VTA). Stimulation of PL-VTA projections causes increased velocity but is not rewarding, despite the well-known rewarding effect of direct stimulation of VTA-dopamine neurons. Taken together with the fact that VTA has been implicated in exploration, my central hypothesis is that PL-VTA neurons mediate natural exploratory behaviors through downstream effects on a subpopulation of non-dopaminergic VTA neurons. To investigate this hypothesis, I will first develop an unbiased, machine-learning-based method to quantify untrained, freely-moving mouse behaviors (Experiment 1.1). My method will leverage multi-view, high resolution video, supervised body part tracking, and unsupervised machine learning-based postural clustering methods. I will use this method to identify which specific behaviors (rearing, walking, grooming, sniffing, etc.) are affected by optogenetic stimulation or inhibition of PL-VTA cells in the presence and absence of rewards (Experiment 1.2). Preliminary data demonstrates the feasibility of my behavioral quantification method and suggests that PL-VTA stimulation increases exploratory behaviors. Next, to identify the genetically- and target-defined VTA cells that are preferentially synapsed onto by PL projections, I will use a combination of optogenetics, in vitro electrophysiology, transgenic mice, and retrograde tracing. First, I will use transgenic mice to measure the functional strength of PL input specifically onto VTA cells that are dopaminergic, GABAergic, or glutamatergic (Experiment 2.1). In a different set of mice, I will use retrograde tracing to identify if PL synapses preferentially onto VTA cells that project to nucleus accumbens or amygdala (Experiment 2.2). After learning which genetic and target-defined VTA subpopulations receive PL input, I will use retrograde tracing in combination with transgenic labeling to identify specifically which genetically and projection-defined VTA subpopulation receives PL input (Experiment 2.3). Finally, I will use a retrograde cre-dependent virus to selectively infect this VTA subpopulation with ChR2 and use my behavioral quantification pipeline to investigate whether in vivo stimulation of this subpopulation recapitulates the exploratory effects of PL-VTA stimulation (Experiment 2.4). Thus, the project proposed will develop a novel method for quantifying naturalistic behavior and integrate this computational method with diverse experimental methods, including in vivo and in vitro optogenetics, natural behavior, and synaptic physiology. These experiments will contribute novel information on how the PL-VTA circuit mediates naturalistic motor output, independent of the reinforcement effects of VTA-dopamine activity. PROJECT NARRATIVE Investigating how neural circuits mediate natural behavior is a critical to our understanding of the brain, but until recently methods for quantifying spontaneous behavior have been limited. I will develop a novel computational method for assessing how naturalistic exploratory behaviors are mediated by a subset of prefrontal cortex cells and the midbrain cells onto which they synapse. In total, this project will combine computational and experimental methods to map prefrontal-midbrain circuit and identify its effects on natural exploratory behavior.",Defining the role of a prefrontal-midbrain circuit in exploratory behavior,10146550,F32MH125546,"['Affect ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Animals ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Color ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Dopamine ', ' Hydroxytyramine ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Environment ', ' Exploratory Behavior ', ' Glutamates ', ' L-Glutamate ', ' glutamatergic ', ' Goals ', ' Grooming ', ' In Vitro ', ' Learning ', ' Locomotion ', ' Maps ', ' Midbrain structure ', ' Mesencephalon ', ' Mid-brain ', ' Midbrain ', ' Methods ', ' Transgenic Mice ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Nucleus Accumbens ', ' Physiology ', ' Posture ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Research ', ' Rewards ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' Supervision ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Time ', ' Virus ', ' Measures ', ' Walking ', ' Mediating ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' ventral tegmentum ', ' Ventral Tegmental Area ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' Medial ', ' Training ', ' Body part ', ' Stimulus ', ' Genetic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' cell type ', ' Viral ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' transgenic ', ' Transgenic Organisms ', ' novel ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' DA Neuron ', ' Dopamine neuron ', ' dopaminergic neuron ', ' response ', ' cell cortex ', ' Data ', ' Dopaminergic Cell ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Motor output ', ' Population ', ' optogenetics ', ' behavior response ', ' behavioral response ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NIMH,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,F32,2020,69926,NJ-12,-0.11309809156456349
"Dissecting and modifying temporal dynamics underlying major depressive disorder Title: Dissecting and modifying temporal dynamics underlying major depressive disorder Multiple human imaging studies have described aberrant spatiotemporal dynamics in specific brain networks across subjects with major depressive disorder. Furthermore, rodent studies have identified dysfunctional synchrony across cortical limbic circuits in genetic and stress- induced models of major depressive disorder. Nevertheless, it remains to be clarified whether these observed changes in neural dynamics play a causal role or simply reflect (i.e., correlate with) the behavioral-state observed in major depressive disorder. Several major challenges to addressing this question exist. 1) The brain synchronizes dynamics across multiple timescales. Rodent studies classically monitor dynamics at the millisecond time scale (reflecting circuits), and human studies typically monitor brain dynamics at the seconds time scale (reflect circuit and network level activity). 2) Rodent studies are generally limited in their ability to monitor large-scale activity from many brain regions concurrently, while human imaging studies observe activity across the whole brain. 3) To our knowledge, few approaches/models integrate changes in cell-type specific gene expression implicated in depression to changes in circuit and network- specific brain dynamics. 4) Techniques which directly manipulate brain dynamics (neural synchrony and cross-frequency coupling) have yet to be largely implemented throughout the rodent research community. To address these challenges, we propose to perform multi-circuit in vivo neural recordings in the two widely used rodent models of depression. We will then utilize machine learning to determine the spatiotemporal dynamic alterations that are shared between the two models. Next, we will test whether cellular molecular manipulations implicated in major depressive disorder are sufficient to induce the same spatiotemporal dynamic alterations. Finally, we will verify that these spatiotemporal dynamics are causal by directly inducing and suppressing them and measuring their impact on behavior. This strategy will yield an unprecedented understanding of how altered dynamics within specific brain circuits contribute to depression. Many cortical and limbic brain regions including prefrontal cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, and thalamus work together to coordinate emotional, social and cognitive function in health and disease. In this study, we will discover the network-level mechanisms whereby fast interactions between these brain regions become altered in major depressive disorder. The discovery and validation of this ‘depression brain-state’ may facilitate the development of new therapeutics that ameliorate depression by directly modulating altered neural dynamics in the brain.",Dissecting and modifying temporal dynamics underlying major depressive disorder,10004169,R01MH120158,"['Amygdaloid structure ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Antidepressive Agents ', ' Antidepressant Agent ', ' Antidepressant Drugs ', ' Antidepressants ', ' anti-depressant agent ', ' anti-depressant drugs ', ' anti-depressants ', ' anti-depressive agents ', ' Anxiety ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cognition ', ' Communities ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Emotions ', ' Exhibits ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Health ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Nucleus Accumbens ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Social Behavior ', ' sociobehavior ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' Thalamus ', ' thalamic ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Mediating ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' ventral tegmentum ', ' Ventral Tegmental Area ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Chronic ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Behavioral Manipulation ', ' behavioral control ', ' Behavior Control ', ' cognitive function ', ' Msec ', ' millisecond ', ' Frequencies ', ' cell type ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' Viral ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' novel ', ' disorder model ', ' Disease model ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' clinical depression ', ' major depression ', ' major depression disorder ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' Brain region ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' Preclinical Models ', ' Pre-Clinical Model ', ' in vivo ', ' Cognitive ', ' Collection ', ' Rodent Model ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pre-clinical study ', ' preclinical study ', ' Social Functioning ', ' Outcome ', ' neural mechanism ', ' neuromechanism ', ' Coupling ', ' Impairment ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' reward processing ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' murine model ', ' mouse model ', ' network models ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' optogenetics ', ' depressive model ', ' depression model ', ' human imaging ', ' imaging study ', ' social defeat ', ' emotional functioning ', ' ']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,713309,NC-04,-0.10016699924811241
"Layer-specific encoding of working memory in an automated 8-arm radial maze PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Working memory (WM), the cognitive entity that allows for temporary storage and manipulation of informa- tion, is crucial for much of what gives life subjective meaning, and enables an individual to participate in larger society. This includes following a conversation, finding a supermarket item, planning, driving, learning new skills—most anything that requires holding in mind information from long-term memory and/or sensory input for use requires WM. As a result, WM dysfunction has devastating effects, and regrettably, millions—individuals with schizophrenia, depression, ADHD, dementia, and more—experience varying degrees of WM impairment, which is almost totally treatment resistant. Given its role in neurocognitive health and disease, understanding the mechanisms of WM is imperative. Correspondingly, this project will explore in depth the circuit basis for WM.  The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is known to be a primary orchestrator of WM, processing input from other brain regions for WM instantiation. In spatial working memory (SWM), a WM subdomain regularly studied across species, interactions of the PFC with the ventral hippocampus and mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus (MD) are considered essential, with PFC-MD interactions undergirding neural maintenance of WM content and subsequent action selection. Notably, the PFC is quite heterogeneous, being composed of layers that differ both in their cellular composition and in their connectivity. Yet the possibility that these laminar subregions might uniquely contribute to the multifaceted ways in which the PFC empowers WM is only now being explored: recent studies suggest that superficial PFC layers support WM content maintenance, while deep PFC layers support post-maintenance action selection. This proposal expands upon these studies by using novel technology to explore cellular-resolution laminar representations in WM.  Specifically, this proposal examines what WM content is encoded in the activity of individual cells vs. popula- tions in the different PFC layers (Aim 1) and assesses the dependence of these laminar WM representations on input from the MD (Aim 2). To do so, calcium imaging will be performed through microendoscopes in mice genetically and surgically specified to express calcium indicators in particular PFC layers. These mice will perform a trial-based delayed nonmatch to sample WM task in a custom-built, automated 8-armed radial maze, and for Aim 2 will have MD input to the PFC optogenetically silenced during behavior and imaging (to simulate the MD-PFC hypoconnectivity regularly observed in those with WM deficits). Finally, for rigorous mapping of behavior to neural activity, novel machine learning behavioral classification paradigms will be used.  WM provides the cognitive building blocks for the very fabric of quotidian life—sustaining social relationships, maintaining a job, living independently, learning new things and more. Given such complexity, detailed interrogation of WM circuit mechanisms is required. Accordingly, this proposal uses emerging technologies to explore circuit mechanisms of both WM function and dysfunction, advancing pursuits of therapeutic innovation. PROJECT NARRATIVE Working memory, the cognitive entity through which information can be temporarily held in mind for processing, is fundamental to many essential human activities, from holding a conversation, to walking home from the bus stop, to introspecting. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) has long been known to undergird working memory, with information maintenance empowered by input from the mediodorsal thalamus (MD), but how the different PFC layers support this complex and versatile capability remains largely unclear. This proposal will assess the neural representations in PFC layers during spatial working memory, and how they depend on MD input, to better establish circuit mechanisms for working memory instantiation, to the end of moving us closer to eventual therapies for the millions affected by working memory impairment.",Layer-specific encoding of working memory in an automated 8-arm radial maze,10067892,F31MH124323,"['Neurocognitive ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Visit ', ' Supermarket ', ' empowered ', ' calcium indicator ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' skills ', ' memory processing ', ' memory process ', ' novel ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' AD/HD ', ' ADHD ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' Brain region ', ' Motor ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Resolution ', ' Cognitive ', ' Emergent Technologies ', ' Emerging Technologies ', ' To specify ', ' Process ', ' cell imaging ', ' cellular imaging ', ' Behavioral ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' cost ', ' Population ', ' Mind ', ' prospective ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' resistant ', ' Resistance ', ' Implant ', ' memory encoding ', ' lenses ', ' lens ', ' arm ', ' operation ', ' optogenetics ', ' Complex thinking ', ' Evaluative Thinking ', ' Critical Thinking ', ' sensory input ', ' independent learning ', ' self-regulated learning ', ' self-directed learning ', ' endomicrosope ', ' microendoscope ', ' Injections ', ' Grain ', ' social relationships ', ' Affect ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Calcium ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Cues ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Evolution ', ' Genotype ', ' Health ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Human Activities ', ' Independent Living ', ' indexing ', ' Learning ', ' Maintenance ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' working memory ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Occupations ', ' Jobs ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Primates ', ' Primates Mammals ', ' Research ', ' Rewards ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Societies ', ' Task Performances ', ' Technology ', ' Textiles ', ' fabric ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' Thalamus ', ' thalamic ', ' Enterobacteria phage P1 Cre recombinase ', ' CRE Recombinase ', ' bacteriophage P1 recombinase Cre ', ' Opsin ', ' Rod-Opsin ', ' Walking ', ' Custom ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' base ', ' Medial ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Training ', ' Dorsomedial Nucleus ', ' Dorsomedial Nucleus of the Thalamus ', ' Dorsomedial Thalamic Nucleus ', ' Mediodorsal Nucleus ', ' Mediodorsal Thalamic Nucleus ', ' Medial Dorsal Nucleus ', ' Memory Deficit ', ' memory dysfunction ', ' Memory impairment ', ' Individual ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Metabolic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Behavioral Manipulation ', ' behavioral control ', ' Behavior Control ', ' Life ', ' longterm memory ', ' long term memory ', ' Investigation ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Radius ', ' Radial ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Sensory ', ' Location ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' ']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,F31,2020,45520,NY-13,-0.006218793829890727
"Decoding Early Signs of Alzheimer's Disease in The Lateral Entorhinal Cortex Using Machine Learning The lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) is one of the first regions in the brain to be affected in Alzheimer’s disease, and is important for object recognition, odor discrimination and episodic memory. Hence, early AD symptoms such as misplacing objects, forgetting events and loss of smell could be due to LEC dysfunction. In order to understand how Aβ and tau accumulation impacts the LEC neurons, we will use two mouse models of AD: APP knockin (APP-KI) mice- expressing physiological levels of APP and EC- APP/Tau mice- expressing elevated levels of APP and tau in the EC. Both mouse models show selectively vulnerability in the LEC, making them ideal candidates to probe LEC function. Our preliminary data shows behavioral impairment in the EC-APP/Tau mice at 24 months and data on APP-KI show impairment at 18 months. In the proposal we will evaluate LEC function in the younger mice in order to detect neuronal changes prior to behavioral deficits. We will record LEC activity with silicon probes and test responses towards objects, odors and passage of time. Using computational approach such as machine learning, we will determine if ensemble properties of LEC neurons are affected by tau and Aβ. We hypothesize that APP in the LEC of APP-KI mice will make the neurons dysfunctional which will be evident with poor decoding accuracy for objects, odors and temporal epochs. In the EC-APP/Tau mice, combined effect of Aβ and tau will make the dysfunction worse and affect the decoding accuracy further allowing better prediction of early symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease. The proposal brings together diverse fields (electrophysiology, pathology and computational neuroscience) applying large-scale recording techniques to record ensemble populations of neurons and develop analytical and predictive computational tests to interrogate function in a vulnerable brain region that is dysfunctional in Alzheimer’s disease. Inability to smell odors, misplacing items and confusion with events are some of the earliest symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease and pathology in the lateral entorhinal cortex of the brain could be the major cause for these early symptoms. By using sophisticated electrophysiological techniques and computational analysis, we will investigate the neurons of the lateral entorhinal cortex in Alzheimer’s disease mice and predict disease onset before cognitive symptoms appear.",Decoding Early Signs of Alzheimer's Disease in The Lateral Entorhinal Cortex Using Machine Learning,10017142,R21AG066168,"['Affect ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Animals ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Confusion ', ' Confusional State ', ' Mental Confusion ', ' Cues ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Environment ', ' Fire -

"Integrative labeling, imaging, and reconstruction tools for high-throughput inhibitory microconnectivity analysis in the mouse brain Abstract Neural circuits composed of interconnected neurons with distinct properties lay the physical foundation of any brain function. Identifying connections between individual neurons is central to understand how information is processed and propagated in the brain. While emerging high throughput light microscopy technologies are highly promising in allowing whole brain scale imaging at the single cell level, optical resolution limitation prevents their use in differentiating densely labeled neuronal processes in the same brain. In addition, computational tools for automatically extracting morphological information from intermingled neurons with high accuracy are still lacking. Our team will concurrently develop novel genetic tools for neuronal labeling, super-resolution imaging, and automated neuronal tracing for high-throughput circuit reconstruction. We will apply these tools to obtain densely reconstructed inhibitory microcircuits in the mouse cortex. These tools will be readily applicable for studying other long-standing questions in neuroscience and the resources generated by this project will be useful for future computational tool development. Narrative Neuronal morphology is an important attribute for characterizing neural developmental and degenerative diseases. Abnormal dendritic and/or axonal arbors indicate disfunction in neuronal activity and connectivity. Automated reconstruction of neural circuit from a densely labeled brain remains a technical challenge as the intermingled neuronal processes result in many ambiguities when they appear as running into each other in a light microscopy image. We will develop an integrative strategy, which combines advanced labeling, sample preparing, imaging and computing techniques to permit automated microconnectivity analysis in regular neurobiology labs. Our study on inhibitory microcircuits in the mouse cortex will greatly advance the fundamental knowledge about how inhibition is formed. This is highly relevant to the circuitry mechanism of Autism Spectrum Disorder and many other neural disorder diseases, which are caused by an excitation-inhibition imbalance in the brain.","Integrative labeling, imaging, and reconstruction tools for high-throughput inhibitory microconnectivity analysis in the mouse brain",10025817,RF1MH123402,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Auditory area ', ' Auditory Cortex ', ' Axon ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Feedback ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' image reconstruction ', ' image construction ', ' image generation ', ' Interneurons ', ' Connector Neuron ', ' Intercalary Neuron ', ' Intercalated Neurons ', ' Internuncial Cell ', ' Internuncial Neuron ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Maps ', ' Electron Microscopy ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Running ', ' Spatial Distribution ', ' Stains ', ' Staining method ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Technology ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' Thalamus ', ' thalamic ', ' Visual Cortex ', ' visual cortical ', ' Neurites ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Solid ', ' Training ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' Morphology ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' light microscopy ', ' millimeter ', ' Auditory ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Speed ', ' novel ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' developmental disorder ', ' developmental disease ', ' 3-D Images ', ' 3-D image ', ' 3D image ', ' 3D images ', ' Three-Dimensional Image ', ' Brain region ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' degenerative condition ', ' degenerative disease ', ' Degenerative Disorder ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Physiologic Imaging ', ' physiological imaging ', ' Functional Imaging ', ' To specify ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Output ', ' Pyramidal neuron ', ' hippocampal pyramidal neuron ', ' reconstruction ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' tool development ', ' cloud based ', ' learning network ', ' microscope imaging ', ' microscopy imaging ', ' microscopic imaging ', ' anatomical imaging ', ' anatomic imaging ', ' deep learning ', ' neural network ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' Cre driver ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,RF1,2020,3144081,MI-12,-0.04518895961398743
"Role of the Hippocampal-mPFC Pathway in Social Memory Deficits in Autism PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The hippocampus is critical for the formation and consolidation of spatial memories and contributes to other cognitive tasks through its efferent projections. The goal of this project is to determine whether altered neuronal network activity in the hippocampus of an autism mouse model propagates to, and alters distal cortical regions involved in social behaviors.  One of the core symptoms of autism spectrum disorders, such as Rett syndrome (RTT), is a deficit in social interaction. In mice, similar social behavior impairments can be modeled by altering the excitation and inhibition (E/I) balance in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). For RTT, knocking out the gene that is mutated in humans, Mecp2, causes hyperactivity in the ventral hippocampus (vHIP) due to an E/I imbalance driven by impaired inhibition and enhanced excitation, resulting in saturated synaptic plasticity at excitatory synapses. Intriguingly, CA1 pyramidal neurons of the vHIP project their axons to the mPFC, making direct monosynaptic connections with excitatory pyramidal neurons and inhibitory interneurons. We propose to characterize how the vHIP influences mPFC activity through this long-range monosynaptic glutamatergic projection. Importantly, we will test whether altered vHIP network activity is causal to mPFC dysfunction and deficits in social interaction. We hypothesize that atypically strong vHIP afferents alter network activity in the mPFC of Mecp2 KO mice by affecting the E/I balance and synaptic plasticity, which in turn contributes to social interaction deficits. To test this hypothesis, we will identify the cellular targets of direct vHIP afferents in the mPFC of RTT mice and characterize their function in social behaviors using a combination of optogenetics, chemogenetics, ex vivo and in vivo electrophysiology and Ca2+ imaging, anterograde and retrograde tract tracing, and unbiased machine-learning behavioral assessments.  We propose the following Specific Aims: 1) identify and characterize the cellular targets of the monosynaptic projection from the vHIP to the mPFC in Mecp2 KO mice; 2) characterize long-term synaptic plasticity of the vHIP-mPFC projection in Mecp2 KO mice; and 3) determine if chemogenetic modulation of the activity of mPFC-projecting vHIP neurons alters mPFC function and social behaviors.  These studies will provide fundamental information on the functional and structural properties of the long- range connection between the vHIP and mPFC in the developing brain. The impact of this work extends beyond RTT to other neuropsychiatric disorders in which propagation of network dysfunction from the hippocampus to the mPFC is believed to contribute to cognitive deficits. PROJECT NARRATIVE Rett syndrome is a syndromic autism-spectrum disorder that presents with deficits in social behaviors and cognitive abilities, which may result from impaired function of the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. The proposed study is the first characterization of a long-range monosynaptic connection in Rett mice using optogenetics and chemogenetics, and will test whether hippocampal hyperactivity propagates to the medial prefrontal cortex, leading to autism-related social deficits.",Role of the Hippocampal-mPFC Pathway in Social Memory Deficits in Autism,9843172,R01MH118563,"['Affect ', ' Axon ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Genes ', ' Glutamates ', ' L-Glutamate ', ' glutamatergic ', ' Goals ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immunohistochemistry ', ' Immunohistochemistry Cell/Tissue ', ' Immunohistochemistry Staining Method ', ' Interneurons ', ' Connector Neuron ', ' Intercalary Neuron ', ' Intercalated Neurons ', ' Internuncial Cell ', ' Internuncial Neuron ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Rett Syndrome ', ' Cerebroatrophic Hyperammonemia ', ' Rett Disorder ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Social Behavior ', ' sociobehavior ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Opsin ', ' Rod-Opsin ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' MeCP-2 protein ', ' MeCP2 ', ' MeCP2 protein ', ' Methyl CpG Binding Protein 2 ', ' Methyl CpG binding protein MeCP2 ', ' Methyl-CpG binding protein 2 ', ' Methyl-DNA binding protein MECP2 ', ' Methyl-CpG-Binding Protein 2 ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Medial ', ' Distal ', ' Site ', ' Synaptic Potentials ', ' Longterm Potentiation ', ' Long-Term Potentiation ', ' KO mice ', ' Knock-out Mice ', ' Null Mouse ', ' Knockout Mice ', ' Link ', ' Fiber ', ' Memory Deficit ', ' memory dysfunction ', ' Memory impairment ', ' Confocal Microscopy ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Morphology ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Hyperactivity ', ' Hyperkinesia ', ' Hyperkinesis ', ' Hyperkinetic Movements ', ' Motor Hyperactivity ', ' Hyperactive behavior ', ' Contralateral ', ' System ', ' membrane structure ', ' Membrane ', ' cellular targeting ', ' Structure ', ' cognitive defects ', ' Cognitive deficits ', ' novel ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' Long-Term Synaptic Depression ', ' longterm depression ', ' longterm synaptic depression ', ' Long-Term Depression ', ' behavioral assessment ', ' Behavior assessment ', ' Symptoms ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Mutate ', ' in vivo ', ' Excitatory Synapse ', ' Slice ', ' wildtype mouse ', ' Wild Type Mouse ', ' Knockout ', ' Knock-out ', ' Neurological Development Disorder ', ' Neurodevelopmental Disorder ', ' Behavioral ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Pyramidal neuron ', ' hippocampal pyramidal neuron ', ' network dysfunction ', ' Synaptic plasticity ', ' Impairment ', ' murine model ', ' mouse model ', ' impaired behavior ', ' behavioral impairment ', ' optogenetics ', ' cognitive task ', ' cognitive ability ', ' spatial memory ', ' DREADDs ', ' designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' potentiometric dye ', ' voltage sensitive dye ', ' social defects ', ' social disorders ', ' social dysfunction ', ' social deficits ', ' post-natal development ', ' postnatal development ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R01,2020,393603,AL-07,0.04020753302267829
"Septohippocampal circuit deep brain stimulation for selective RDoC aspects of cognition Project Summary The septohippocampal circuit plays a crucial role in multiple cognitive Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) domains, including memory, attention, anxiety, and sensorimotor processing. This circuit is comprised primarily of the medial septal nucleus (MSN), hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Pharmacological and genetic models targeting glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor hypofunction within this circuit result in memory deficits, difficulty with attention, and social interaction impairments. Therefore, we are studying the relationship between MSN-mPFC- hippocampal oscillatory activity in NMDA receptor hypofunction models to better create treatments for disrupted theta and gamma oscillations which are altered in a variety of psychiatric disorders. Recent evidence suggests that deep brain stimulation (DBS) may be one such promising treatment modality for circuit disorders. This NIMH K08 Career Development Award will provide the necessary foundation for Darrin J. Lee, MD, PhD to pursue the development of novel DBS techniques for septohippocampal circuit disorders. The project and training plan are rooted in the electrophysiological and molecular underpinnings of NMDA receptor hypofunction, while concomitantly enabling the candidate to collaborate with and learn from his mentors and consultants. This program will enable him to supplement his current skillsets in areas where he has identified gaps in his knowledge base, including relevant research methodology, study design, machine learning, and structural connectivity. The proposed research will focus on 1) characterizing neural oscillations within the septohippocampal circuit in two complementary models of NMDA receptor hypofunction (pharmacological: chronic MK-801 administration and genetic: parvalbumin interneuron-selective NR1 knockout); 2) evaluating the cognitive effects of DBS in these rodent models, and 3) evaluating the relationship between electrophysiological biomarkers and behavior using machine learning. The interpretation of data from this research will improve understanding of specific electrophysiological aspects of impaired brain function in septohippocampal circuit disorders and serve as a catalyst for a research program centered on neuromodulation for these disorders. Moreover, data collected, skills procured, and collaborations developed will enable Dr. Lee to seek R01 funding and obtain career independence. Taken together, the data collected, and training developed will ultimately facilitate development of an investigator with unique skills in service of ameliorating suffering caused by septohippocampal circuit disorders. Project Narrative Current treatments for psychiatric disorders with deficits in cognitive and emotional Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) domains have limited efficacy, necessitating more effective treatment strategies. Disorders with NMDA receptor hypofunction lead to septohippocampal circuit dysfunction and circuit-specific cognitive dysfunction.

"Behavioral and neural algorithms for decision confidence Project Summary/Abstract The long-term goal of our investigations is to understand how neural circuits in the frontal cortex support decision- making. Orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) plays a key role in decision-making under uncertainty and is thought to enable humans and other animals to make predictions about outcomes more accurately. The objective of this proposal is to determine the algorithms responsible for confidence-guided behaviors and their neural basis in the mammalian brain.  Previous work from our laboratory has shown that `decision confidence', a cognitive variable, is encoded in single OFC neurons and OFC inactivation specifically impairs a confidence-guided behavior, time investment. The proposed experiments are designed to determine the computational and neural algorithms responsible for two confidence-guided behaviors: time investment and choice strategy updating (learning). Our central hypothesis is that OFC generates an abstract representation of decision confidence, independent of sensory evidence, that supports multiple confidence-guided behaviors. To test this idea, we have designed a quantitative psychophysical task for rats, adapted from human and primate work, that enable behavioral readouts of confidence, as a post-decision temporal wager. Simply, after each perceptual decision (olfactory or auditory) rats invest time waiting for a delayed, uncertain reward. These graded- duration time investments serve as a behavioral report of confidence that the perceptual decision just made will result in the success of the perceptual decision. First, we will develop computational algorithms to explain confidence-guided time investment and learning, and second we will identify neural substrates of these algorithms in the OFC. Third, we will determine if OFC representations are sensory-modality and behavioral-output general and test the causal role of OFC using inactivations. Finally, we will map a sensory route for auditory information to inform OFC representations and test the hypothesis that auditory cortex lesions lead to deaf-hearing, the ability to discriminate sounds without perceptual confidence.  These contributions are significant, in our opinion, because they will provide critical missing information about the algorithmic and neural foundations of decision confidence, a key cognitive variable. Our approach is innovative, chiefly because we have developed a computational and behavioral framework to study confidence in rats. Beyond these mechanistic studies, the proposed work will advance knowledge about the frontal cortical logic of cognitive variable representations and inform an improved framework for understanding how impairments in a single brain area can lead to a wide range of psychiatric disorders, as seen in depression, obsessive- compulsive and psychotic disorders.

"Modeling the structure-function relation in a reconstructed cortical tissue Abstract  How is connectivity between neurons related to patterns of activity exhibited by these neurons in vivo? This question of structure-function relations in brain circuits is of fundamental importance. Answering it in a quantitative manner would have far-reaching consequences both for our theories of how brain works and for applications ranging from better disease treatments to new tools for artificial intelligence. However, our current understanding of structure-function relations is relatively poor, in large part because the fine structure of neuronal connectivity has remained largely unknown. In turn, this severely limits connecting modeling to theoretical efforts. This problem is particularly challenging in the case of studying the highly heterogeneous cortical circuits, which are involved in important functions like perception, cognition, and learning.  Fortunately, recent experimental work by our collaborators at the Allen Institute for Brain Science is now resulting in transformational new datasets that characterize connectivity in the mouse cortical area V1 at the level of Cell Types using multi-patch synaptic physiology and at the level of individual neurons using electron microscopy (EM). For the first time in history of neuroscience, we will have connectome of individual neurons coupled with dense recordings of activity in ~1 mm3 of V1, plus systematic characterization of synaptic properties.  We will leverage these unique datasets to build and share with the community new models of V1 and use them to study the relationships between cortical connectivity and in vivo activity and computations. We will analyze how multiple features of neuronal code depend on individual cell properties and on higher-order connectivity motifs, which are present in the EM connectome, but not in the statistics-based connectivity inferred from sparse measurements at the Cell Types level or from existing literature. We also will evaluate the consistency of the new models of V1 with predictions made by current theories of structure-function relations.  These models and simulations will be freely shared with the community as a resource that scientists will use to guide future experiment designs, improve biological realism in models, and assist in generating and testing theories. By providing a rich and biologically realistic framework for new theoretical, modeling, and experimental studies, this resource will fuel new discoveries regarding relations between the structure and function of cortical circuits. To improve our understanding of the healthy brain as well as what breaks down in disease, it is essential to develop a quantitative, mechanistic description of how properties of neurons and their connections determine the properties of neural activity in vivo. This project will take advantage of unprecedented experimental datasets from the Allen Institute for Brain Science that contain a systematic characterization of synaptic connections between the cell types present and a connectome of individual neurons coupled with dense recordings of activity in the mouse visual cortex. We propose to integrate these data into new, highly realistic network models of cortical circuits, use the models to explore theoretical predictions, and provide them as a resource to fuel future theoretical, modeling, and experimental work in the community.",Modeling the structure-function relation in a reconstructed cortical tissue,10005712,R01EB029813,"['Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cognition ', ' Communities ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Exhibits ', ' Future ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Institutes ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Electron Microscopy ', ' Structural Models ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Perception ', ' Physiology ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Science ', ' statistics ', ' area striata ', ' Primary visual cortex ', ' Striate Cortex ', ' Striate area ', ' Structure-Activity Relationship ', ' chemical structure function ', ' structure function relationship ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Visual Cortex ', ' visual cortical ', ' Work ', ' case report ', ' Case Study ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' Individual ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Measurement ', ' Morphology ', ' tool ', ' Scientist ', ' Dependence ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' model-based simulation ', ' models and simulation ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' theories ', ' Data ', ' in vivo ', ' reconstruction ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' area V1 ', ' Coupled ', ' network models ', ' connectome ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' ']",NIBIB,ALLEN INSTITUTE,R01,2020,1349805,WA-07,0.006666783628363876
"Reverse Engineering the Brain Stem Circuits that Govern Exploratory Behavior Overview - Abstract  Brainstem function is necessary for life-sustaining functions such as breathing and for survival functions, such as foraging for food. Individual motor actions are activated by specific brainstem cranial motor nuclei. The specificity of individual motor actions reflects the participation of motor nuclei in circuits within closed loops between sensors and muscle actuators. However, these loops are also nested and connect to feedback and feedforward pathways, which underlie coordination between orofacial motor actions. A key question for this proposal is how different actions are coordinated to form a rich repertoire of behaviors, such as rhythmic motions linked to breathing, and the orchestrated displacements of the head, nose, tongue, and vibrissae during exploration. We postulate that the best candidate interface for orofacial motor coordination are premotor and pre2motor neuron populations in the brainstem reticular formation: these neurons project to cranial motor nuclei, receive descending inputs from outside of the brainstem, and interconnected to each other.  Our approach exploits and expands upon a broad spectrum of innovative experimental tools. These include state-of-the-art behavioral methods to study motor actions and their coordination into behaviors. From an experimental perspective, the underlying neuronal circuitry for each orofacial motor action may be accessed via transsynaptic transport starting at the muscle activators or associated sensors in the periphery. These studies will make use of molecular, genetic, and functional labeling methods to enable cell phenotyping and circuit tracing. These data will establish the ""Components"", i.e., brainstem nuclei connectivity for all Research Projects. These studies are complemented by in vivo electrophysiology and optogenetics in order measure and perturb the signal flow during exploration and decision-making: these studies will establish orofacial “Wiring Diagrams”. The sum of these techniques will permit us to elucidate the functions of intrinsic brainstem circuits and their modulation by descending pathways.  Our data will be integrated in two ways. First we will begin development of computational models of the dynamics of active sensing by the orofacial motor plant and brainstem circuits. These will initially focus on the vibrissa system, starting with characterizations of mechanics and mechano-neuronal transformations of vibrissa movement and extending to exploration of brainstem circuits that drive vibrissa set-point and rhythmic whisking. Finally, vibrissa feedforward pathways will be computationally modeled to explore how sensory input affects vibrissa dynamics. Second, to record connectivity data that arises from our experimental tracing studies, we will construct an Trainable Texture-based Digital Atlas that utilizes machine learning to automate anatomical annotation of brainstem nuclei. The Atlas is designed to allow accurate 3D alignment of labeled neurons, even when labeled neurons reside in small sub-regions outside of well-defined brainstem nuclei, based on triangulation to Atlas landmark structures. Further, digitization of serially sectioned brain data sets allows 3D reconstruction and alignment of small brainstem subregions as well as the collation of this data from different brains into the same Atlas.  Our proposed program on brainstem circuitry and dynamics will yield general lessons about the nature of neuronal computation. The analytic and anatomical tools developed for these studies will be made available through our data science core to the larger neuroscience community. Narrative Reverse engineering the brain stem circuits that govern exploratory behavior Neuronal circuits in the brainstem control life-sustaining functions, including breathing and orofacial motor actions that underlie exploration, that must be performed without interruption from the moment of birth. We will use and advance the tools of modern neuroscience to add informative labels to individual neurons in the brainstem, place these cells within circuits, connect circuits with motor actions, and coordinate different actions into behaviors. Our procedures, analysis, and modeling will mitigate many of the challenges that have limited our ability to discern the structure and function of brainstem circuits in normal and diseased states.",Reverse Engineering the Brain Stem Circuits that Govern Exploratory Behavior,9930683,U19NS107466,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Breathing ', ' Respiratory Aspiration ', ' Respiratory Inspiration ', ' inspiration ', ' Atlases ', ' Behavior ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Stem ', ' Brainstem ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communities ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Decision Making ', ' Dedications ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Engineering ', ' Exploratory Behavior ', ' Feedback ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Goals ', ' Head ', ' Histology ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Joints ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Literature ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Motion ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Muscle ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' muscular ', ' Neuroanatomy ', ' Neuranatomies ', ' Neuranatomy ', ' Neuroanatomies ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Nose ', ' Nasal ', ' Nasal Passages Nose ', ' Respiratory System, Nose, Nasal Passages ', ' Periodicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Phenotype ', ' Plants ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Reticular Formation ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' Esthesia ', ' Sensation ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Specificity ', ' Tongue ', ' Vibrissae ', ' Whiskers ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Molecular Genetics ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' sensor ', ' Procedures ', ' Cranial ', ' Cephalic ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Sensory ', ' Texture ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' neuron component ', ' physical model ', ' neuronal circuit ', ' neuronal circuitry ', ' Structure ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Data ', ' Interruption ', ' Motor ', ' Sum ', ' in vivo ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' active control ', ' Output ', ' orofacial ', ' reconstruction ', ' digital ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Motor output ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' platform-independent ', ' motor control ', ' optogenetics ', ' sensory input ', ' control theory ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' Computer Models ', ' Data Science Resource Core ', ' Data Science Core ', ' ']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U19,2020,2983524,CA-52,-0.12486356156254463
"Mapping the neural circuitry underlying walking Project Summary Walking is an essential and conserved behavior across the animal kingdom. The ability to move in a coordinated, robust yet flexible manner is a crucial for an animal’s survival in the ever changing environment. Motor behaviors are controlled by sensory neuropils in the brain which talk to motor centers such as the ventral nerve cord (VNC) in the thorax to execute precise motor outputs. Descending neurons are the primary conduits of information that accomplish this connection between the brain and the VNC. However the downstream target neurons and complex circuits that precisely govern the execution of a specific kind of limbed motor output such as running, turning, slowing down, switching gait, climbing, stepping etc remain individually undefined. This project aims to map these individual circuits that control different walking kinematics. In aim 1, we will map the post-synaptic targets of descending neurons using a translabeling technique called Trans Tango. We already know from previous studies that have characterized the morphology of all the descending neurons in Drosophila, which DNs target the leg neuropils in the ventral nerve chord. These descending neurons are very likely to be directly implicated in controlling walking behavior. Additionally, we also have broad behavioral information for a subset of the DNs. Using this existing morphological and behavioral data, we can start to map out the motor and premotor circuits that are downstream of these DNs and reveal the distinct circuit components that control specific walking kinematics. Some of the DNs we plan to screen, affect similar behaviors hence it will be interesting to reveal whether they converge onto similar or different targets. In the second aim, we aim to use a computational approach search for generation Gal4 lines whose neuronal expression patterns match the downstream target neurons we want to study. Existing split Gal4 lines will be identified or new ones will be generated in order to gain genetic access to the downstream circuit neurons of interest. In the third aim, we will use three behavior setups: Flywalker, the Arena and the fly-on-ball setup to study a range of walking parameters in high resolution using optogenetics intersectional strategies. We will use optogenetic activation, silencing and also epistasis experiments to map out which components of the circuit are sufficient or necessary for a particular walking kinematic. Project Narrative An animal’s ability to walk in a regulated manner is controlled by the brain through coordinated neural circuitry. Descending neurons are the bridges connecting the brain to the motor centers in thorax that then controls limbed coordination and movement but the exact circuitry downstream of descending neurons responsible for walking remain undefined. This project aims to map these downstream functional circuit components using neuronal translabeling approaches and assess their contribution to precise, robust and flexible motor behavior in Drosophila.",Mapping the neural circuitry underlying walking,9991417,F32MH123012,"['Affect ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Animals ', ' Anions ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Behavior ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cloning ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Drosophila genus ', ' Drosophila ', ' fruit fly ', ' Environment ', ' Genetic Epistasis ', ' Epistasis ', ' Epistatic Deviation ', ' Interaction Deviation ', ' epistatic relationship ', ' gene x gene interaction ', ' genetic epistases ', ' Limb structure ', ' Extremities ', ' Limbs ', ' Non-Trunk ', ' Gait ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Nerve ', ' Neural Pathways ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Afferent Neurons ', ' Sensory Cell Afferent Neuron ', ' Sensory Neurons ', ' Play ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rhodopsin ', ' Visual Purple ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Testing ', ' Generations ', ' Walking ', ' Label ', ' Link ', ' motor disease ', ' motor dysfunction ', ' motor disorder ', ' Neuropil ', ' Individual ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Genetic ', ' Morphology ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Diseases ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural degenerative Disorders ', ' Neurodegenerative Diseases ', ' Neurologic Degenerative Conditions ', ' degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons ', ' degenerative neurological diseases ', ' neurodegenerative illness ', ' Neurodegenerative Disorders ', ' interest ', ' brain control ', ' mind control ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' kinematic model ', ' kinematics ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Thorace ', ' Thoracic ', ' Thorax ', ' Chest ', ' Leg ', ' ARNT ', ' Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor Nuclear Translocator ', ' Dioxin Receptor, Nuclear Translocator ', ' HIF-1 Beta Gene ', ' HIF-1Beta Gene ', ' HIF-1beta ', ' HIF1-Beta Gene ', ' HIF1B ', ' HIF1B Gene ', ' HIF1Beta ', ' HIF1beta Gene ', ' Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1 Beta Gene ', ' Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, Beta subunit ', ' Nuclear Translocator Gene Dioxin Receptor ', ' TANGO ', ' ARNT gene ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Resolution ', ' Behavioral ', ' Flies ', ' fly ', ' Output ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Motor output ', ' motor control ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' optogenetics ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' neural network ', ' motor behavior ', ' ']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,F32,2020,73010,NY-13,-0.07909701870949502
"Electrophysiological Evaluation of Brain Regions Vulnerable to Alzheimers Disease The entorhinal cortex (EC) is long known to be the region affected first in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) with symptoms such as disorientation, confusion and inability to navigate appearing early in life. But more recently, a region in the brainstem- locus coeruleus (LC) was found to have tau accumulation in young healthy adults, making it the first region in the brain with AD pathology. The LC is known to be important for arousal and controls the sleep/wake switch. The neurons of LC project to several regions including EC and hippocampus which are known to be important for spatial memory. Unsurprisingly, one of the earliest symptoms of AD is spatial difficulties and it is possible that early pathology in LC affects sleep leading to spatial memory deficits. With both LC and EC important for memory, we aim to identify which of them is more vulnerable to tau and Aβ pathology. To explore this possibility, we will first inject LC and EC regions of wildtype mouse with pathological tau derived from human AD brains to make them dysfunctional, and evaluate their neuronal function. We will also assess sleep and test memory performance in relevant behavior tasks. To understand how aβ affects tau pathology, we will inject human tau in the APP Knock-In mice which has physiological amounts of APP expressed in them. We will determine if Aβ together with tau worsens the neuronal function of LC and EC neurons and it sleep and memory is impaired further. We will use multi-region silicon probes to simultaneously record activity from LC or medial EC and hippocampal neurons. The MEC and hippocampal neurons are well characterized with properties that can be easily measured using spatial navigation tasks. We will make use of virtual reality head-fixed setup for the animals to navigate in, and allowing us to quickly test animal’s memory in any context and environment. The animals will be tested for object-location memory and context-dependent memory in virtual environment. We will use machine learning algorithms to decode animal’s position in the LC, MEC and HPC neural data and determine if it is affected by tau or Aβ or both. We will also assess sleep parameters and correlate with memory. We hypothesize that tau in LC and EC will make its neurons dysfunctional and directly affect sleep and memory, and this in concert with Aβ will exacerbate neuronal dysfunction leading to increased sleep problems and spatial memory impairment as seen in early AD. With this we aim to identify electrophysiological biomarker of neuronal dysfunction before the onset of behavioral troubles. We will test if increasing the neuronal firing in hypoactive neurons and reducing the firing in hyperactive neurons will restore downstream neuronal dysfunction and reverse sleep problems and cognitive impairment. The proposal brings together diverse fields (neuroscience, pathology and computational neuroscience) applying large-scale recording techniques simultaneously across multiple brain regions to develop analytical and predictive tests to interrogate function in vulnerable brain regions that are dysfunctional in AD. The locus coeruleus and the entorhinal cortex region of the brain are among the first to be affected in Alzheimer’s disease, causing sleep problems and cognitive dysfunction. Using multi-region recording probes we will evaluate their function to determine which one of them is more vulnerable to tau and aβ pathology. We will test if by using optogenetic approach the neurons in these regions can be rescued and cognitive deficits be reversed.",Electrophysiological Evaluation of Brain Regions Vulnerable to Alzheimers

"Mechanisms of neural circuit dynamics in working memory anddecision-making Project Summary Working memory, the ability to temporarily hold multiple pieces of information in mind for manipulation, is central to virtually all cognitive abilities. Recent technical advances have opened an unprecedented opportunity to comprehensively dissect the neural circuit mechanisms of this ability across multiple brain areas. The task to be studied is a common form of decision-making that is based on the gradual accumulation of sensory evidence and thus relies on working memory. A team of leading experts propose to investigate the neural basis of this behavior using the latest techniques, including virtual reality, high-throughput automated behavioral training, large-scale cellular-resolution imaging in behaving rodents, manipulation of neural activity in specific brain areas and cell types, and automated anatomical reconstruction. In particular, the researchers will identify key brain regions that are required for this decision task through systematic, temporally specific inactivations via optogenetics technology, across all of dorsal cortex and in key subcortical areas, and use quantitative model-fitting to evaluate the effects. They will use state-of-the-art two-photon calcium imaging methods and electrophysiology to characterize the information flow in many individual neurons within these brain areas during the task. In addition, they will use cutting-edge anatomical reconstructions and new functional connectivity methods, within and across brain regions, to evaluate the interactions of these physiologically characterized neurons. The long-term goal of this project is to arrive at a complete, brain-wide understanding of the cellular and circuit mechanisms of activity dynamics related to working memory. Finally, they will use sophisticated computational methods to incorporate this new understanding into a realistic circuit model that will support a tightly integrated process of model-guided experimental design, in which the model suggests the most informative experiments and their results are then fed back to improve the model’s fidelity. This process is expected to produce the most accurate and detailed multi-brain-region biophysical circuit model of a cognitive process in existence. In addition, the proposed research will enable researchers to generate and test a variety of hypotheses about the neural basis of evidence accumulation, working memory, and decision-making. Taken together, these achievements will represent a crucial step toward a mechanistic understanding of how the brain works with information. Working memory, the capacity to temporarily hold multiple pieces of information in mind for manipulation , is central to almost all cognitive abilities. Many mental diseases, including Alzheimer’s, schizophrenia, dementia, bipolar depression, autism, and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, involve working memory.

"Mozak: Creating an Expert Community to accelerate neuronal reconstruction at scale Project Summary This project aims to leverage the best of both computational and human expertise in neuronal reconstruction towards the goal of accelerating global neuroscience discovery from internationally-sourced imaging data. We propose to create a cloud-based unified platform for converging 3-dimensional images of neurons onto a single analysis platform to (1) train and grow a new expert community of global reconstructors to work across the data from these groups, to (2) generate a community-sourced neuronal reconstruction database of open imaging data that can be incorporated into a 3-dimensional map of neuronal interconnectivity - onto which (3) novel annotations and more complex functional and molecular data can be overlaid. Our approach will evolve with the growing needs of the neuroscience community over time. To do this, in Aim One (Neuronal Reconstruction at Scale), we will test if the newly developed crowd-sourced game-based platform Mozak can develop a collective of new human experts at scale, capable of accelerating the rate of current reconstruction by at least an order of magnitude, at the same time as increasing the robustness, quality and unbiasedness of the final reconstructions. In Aim Two (Robust Multi-Purpose Annotation), we will enhance basic neuronal reconstruction by adding specific semantic annotation— including soma volume and morphological quantification, volumetric analysis, and ongoing features (e.g. dendritic spines, axonal varicosities) requested from the neuroscience community. Experienced and high-ranking members will be given the opportunity to advance through increasingly complex neurons into full arbor brain-wide neuronal projections and multiple clustered groups of neurons in localized circuits. Finally, in Aim 3 (Creation of a Research-Adaptive Data Repository), we aim to develop a database of neuronal images reconstructed using the Mozak interface that will directly serve the general and specific needs of different research groups. Our goal is to make this database dynamically adaptive — as new research questions will invariably bring new needs for additional annotations and cross-referencing with other data modalities. This highquality unbiased processing repository will also be perfectly suited for training sets for automated algorithms, and the generation of a 3-dimensional maps such as Allen Institute for Brain Science (AIBS) common coordinate framework. We expect that the computational reconstruction methods will further improve with the new large corpus of “gold standard” reconstructions. Collectively, the completion of these three aims will create an analysis suite as well as an online community of experts capable of performing in depth analysis of large-scale datasets that will significantly accelerate neuroscience research, enhance machine learning for reconstruction analysis, and create a common platform of baseline neuronal morphology data against which aberrantly functioning neurons can be analyzed. Project Narrative  This project will create a new central nexus point for neuronal reconstruction and semantic annotation (Mozak) that can be used by all research labs via an accessible online portal. We will develop a new cadre of neuronal reconstruction experts that will— in conjunction with automated tools that are enhanced by their work — drastically increase the volume, quality and robustness of neuron reconstructions and annotations. Mozak reconstructions will be shared with existing repositories and will be continually updated and re-annotated based on emerging needs of research - ensuring perpetual relevance, and allowing us to generate a platform to establish the range of “baseline” 3-dimensional readouts of neuronal morphology against which diseased or malfunctioning neurons can be analyzed and understood. 1",Mozak: Creating an Expert Community to accelerate neuronal reconstruction at scale,10005472,R01MH116247,"['Algorithms ', ' Axon ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Sources ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Institutes ', ' Laboratories ', ' Manuals ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Research ', ' Science ', ' Semantics ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Varicosity ', ' Varices ', ' Varicose Veins ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Communicating Junction ', ' Low-resistance Junction ', ' Nexus ', ' Nexus Junction ', ' Gap Junctions ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Morphology ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' experience ', ' neural cell body ', ' soma ', ' neuronal cell body ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Modality ', ' depository ', ' repository ', ' dendrite spine ', ' Dendritic Spines ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Neurosciences Research ', ' Slice ', ' Update ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Output ', ' reconstruction ', ' 3-D analysis ', ' 3-dimensional analysis ', ' 3D analysis ', ' Three-dimensional analysis ', ' Outcome ', ' Imaging technology ', ' 2-dimensional ', ' two-dimensional ', ' cloud based ', ' amateur science ', ' amateur scientists ', ' citizen scientists ', ' civic science ', ' crowd science ', ' crowd-sourced science ', ' scientific citizenship ', ' citizen science ', ' crowd source ', ' crowd-sourcing ', ' crowdsource ', ' crowdsourcing ', ' on-line community ', ' virtual community ', ' online community ', ' internet portal ', ' on-line portal ', ' online portal ', ' web-based portal ', ' web portal ', ' petabyte ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databanks ', ' data depository ', ' data repository ', ' data warehouse ', ' Infrastructure ', ' large scale data sets ', ' large scale datasets ', ' large scale data ', ' automatic algorithm ', ' automated algorithm ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2020,628430,WA-07,0.010326571411315367
"Circuit mechanisms of self-organized cognitive strategies   Project Summary Decades of psychology research have shown that working memory is limited, and humans can only hold a few items in mind at the same time. However, cognitive tasks like planning and problem solving require access to many pieces of information at once. To overcome this constraint, we enlist mnemonic strategies, for instance grouping pieces of information into chunks, as we commonly do to remember telephone or social security numbers. Mnemonic chunking allows us to flexibly organize information on line, providing a fundamental building block for advanced cognitive abilities. Chunking impairments occur when damage or dysfunction involves the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), for instance in patients with schizophrenia, and severely compromises overall cognitive function. Thus, determining how the brain organizes information is a necessary step toward understanding the mechanisms of advanced cognition, and how these go awry in disease states. A key challenge is that strategies for organizing information are self-generated and highly variable in a laboratory setting. A central innovation of this proposal is the novel computational approach used to identify spontaneous mnemonic chunking in macaque monkeys. This is critical because animal models allow us to interrogate brain function with advanced neurophysiological tools. Here, we will use high-density, multi-site recording and targeted neuromodulation to understand the circuit mechanisms that chunk mnemonic information. Previous theoretical work suggests that chunks arise from compressed working memory representations that act as neural shorthand, economizing on processing resources at the cost of degrading some original information. Neurons in dlPFC encode items in working memory, and their dynamics are shaped by recurrent interactions with the basal ganglia. Thus, we hypothesize that corticostriatal interactions promote the efficient reorganization of working memory that underlies chunking. To test this we will investigate dlPFC- striatal dynamics when monkeys spontaneously chunk information in a self-organized working memory task. We will record large numbers of single neurons and local field potentials, and dynamically decode representations held in working memory to assess how mnemonic codes and corticostriatal interactions change when items are or are not chunked. In addition, exogenous stimulation will test the causal role of striatal circuits in promoting the formation of mnemonic chunks. Together, these experiments will determine how the brain establishes mnemonic chunks to optimize working memory performance. This will shed light on a fundamental feature of advanced cognition, and how dysfunction in these mechanisms could give rise to disorders of thought and memory. Finally, understanding mechanisms that optimize cognitive function in a biological system may fuel creative advances that optimize performance in artificial intelligence systems.   Project Narrative This project focuses on understanding circuit dynamics in the prefrontal cortex that mediate mnemonic chunking, a critical strategy for improving working memory performance in advanced cognition. Specifically, we will assess how mnemonic information is bound together in the dynamics of frontal and striatal circuits, and whether these processes can be enhanced with targeted circuit modulation. Our results could provide insights into core deficits in cognitive disorders, such as schizophrenia, and open the door for novel approaches that enhance cognitive function in the setting of working memory deficits.",Circuit mechanisms of self-organized cognitive strategies,9862969,R01MH121480,"['Affect ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Basal Ganglia ', ' Basal Nuclei ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Systematic Bias ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cognition ', ' Cognition Disorders ', ' cognitive disease ', ' cognitive disorder ', ' cognitive syndrome ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Striatum ', ' striatal ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Expert Systems ', ' Intelligent systems ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Macaca ', ' Macaque ', ' Macaca mulatta ', ' M mulatta ', ' M. mulatta ', ' Rhesus Macaque ', ' Rhesus Monkey ', ' Memory ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' working memory ', ' Methods ', ' Monkeys ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Patients ', ' Periodicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Play ', ' Primates ', ' Primates Mammals ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Psychology ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Shorthand ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Memory Deficit ', ' memory dysfunction ', ' Memory impairment ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Visual ', ' non-human primate ', ' nonhuman primate ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Functional disorder ', ' tool ', ' cognitive function ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Performance ', ' neural control ', ' neural regulation ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuroregulation ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' memory recall ', ' cognitive defects ', ' Cognitive deficits ', ' novel ', ' computer-based representation ', ' frame-based representation ', ' knowledge representation ', ' information organization ', ' behavioral test ', ' behavior test ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Social Security Number ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' groupings ', ' Grouping ', ' cost ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' Population ', ' Mind ', ' neural mechanism ', ' neuromechanism ', ' Coupling ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' microstimulation ', ' biological systems ', ' cognitive enhancement ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' comprehending language ', ' language comprehension ', ' cognitive task ', ' cognitive ability ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' Computer Models ', ' ']",NIMH,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2020,479816,NY-13,-0.02384762278374072
"Cerebellar Interactions with the Amygdala and Prefrontal Cortex during Learning Learning is how organisms adapt to changes in their environment and involves the coordination of neural systems mediating cognition, emotion, and motor control. The major goal of the proposed research program is to elucidate the neural circuit mechanisms underlying interactions between cognitive, emotional, and motor systems during associative learning. Interactions between these neural systems are particularly important because the context and emotional significance of stimuli provide essential information for acquisition and performance of motor responses. The breakdown of interactions between cognitive, emotional, and motor systems in various neurological disorders can therefore have devastating consequences for learned behaviors. The prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and cerebellum play significant roles in cognition, emotional responses, and motor learning, respectively. The proposed research program constitutes a comprehensive analysis of cerebellar interactions with the amygdala and prefrontal cortex during associative motor learning. Our general conceptual framework is that the cerebellum receives inputs from the amygdala and prefrontal cortex via the pons regarding which stimuli are important and when they occur, and the cerebellum then sends error-driven feedback to these forebrain systems to facilitate learning about important events. This conceptual framework takes into account the bidirectional relationship between the cerebellum and the relevant forebrain systems as well as interactions between forebrain systems. Multi-site electrophysiology, pathway-specific optogenetics, and precise behavioral analyses will be combined to investigate circuit-level interactions between the cerebellum, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex during associative learning and extinction (inhibitory learning) training. The proposed studies would significantly advance understanding of the neural circuit mechanisms underlying cerebellar interactions with the forebrain. This would be a substantial contribution to the field because it has been known that the cerebellum must interact with the forebrain in many contexts that are crucial for everyday life such as learning, memory, planning, control of emotions, and communication, but very little is known mechanistically about how the cerebellum interacts with the amygdala and prefrontal cortex. Memory deficits are found with many neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and following stroke; the breakdown of interactions between memory systems can be particularly debilitating. This proposal examines the neural mechanisms underlying interactions between emotional and motor memory systems during associative learning. Elucidating the neural mechanisms underlying memory system interactions is potentially important for developing treatments for memory deficits.",Cerebellar Interactions with the Amygdala and Prefrontal Cortex during Learning,9893633,R01NS088567,"['Affect ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Animals ', ' Attention ', ' Blinking ', ' eye blink ', ' eyeblink ', ' Cerebellum ', ' Cognition ', ' Communication ', ' classical conditioning ', ' Associative Learning ', ' Pavlovian conditioning ', ' associative conditioning ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Elements ', ' Emotions ', ' Environment ', ' Extinction (Psychology) ', ' Extinction ', ' behavioral extinction ', ' Feedback ', ' Goals ', ' indexing ', ' Learning ', ' Memory ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' working memory ', ' Methods ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Play ', ' Pontine structure ', ' Pons ', ' Pons Cerebelli ', ' Pons Varolii ', ' Pontine ', ' Rattus ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Rat ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Safety ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Testing ', ' Prosencephalon ', ' Fore-Brain ', ' Forebrain ', ' Mediating ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' Medial ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Training ', ' Memory Deficit ', ' memory dysfunction ', ' Memory impairment ', ' Stimulus ', ' Conditioned Stimulus ', ' learning extinction ', ' Funding ', ' Nature ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Event ', ' System ', ' granule cell ', ' Performance ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Emotional ', ' response ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' fear conditioning ', ' conditioned fear ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Output ', ' 2-photon ', ' two-photon ', ' neural mechanism ', ' neuromechanism ', ' locomotor learning ', ' motor learning ', ' motor control ', ' optogenetics ', ' learning behavior ', ' learned behavior ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2020,374781,IA-02,-0.018629254679390035
"The effects of film music on neural activity in higher-order brain areas and comprehension for the film narrative Music is a powerful memory cue that can reliably transport us to our past -- in  effect, strengthening the associative bond between our present and our past. Modern  neuroscientific investigations of episodic memory could benefit from the use of music due to its  role as a potent memory cue. In this proposal, my goal is to understand how music shapes memory   for past events and how these associations between events are represented in the brain.  The proposed work builds on recent functional MRI studies that have used naturalistic experimental  paradigms such as movie watching and recall to test and refine theories of memory  that (previously) had only been tested under highly-controlled conditions. Here we explore how film  scores shape memory for movies. In movies, film scores sometimes have recurrent structure where a  particular theme song will be repeated throughout, potentially bringing back to mind information  from previous events in which that theme song had been played. Based on prior work showing   that retrieval of a memory strengthens that memory, we predict that the presence of  recurrent musical structure in a film will trigger retrieval of previous events during  movie-watching, which (in turn) will boost memory for these events on a later recall test. In our  study, two groups of participants are recruited: The first group watches a version of a movie in  its original form (with the film score intact) and the control group watches the same film with the  entire film score removed (while preserving dialogue and ambient sounds). Participants from both  groups are asked to return the following day to recall the entire movie in chronological order. By  comparing neural activity between scenes containing music and previous scenes containing the same  (or similar) music between the two groups, we expect to find evidence of neural reinstatement of  past scenes in the music group; furthermore, we predict that higher levels of reinstatement during  movie-viewing will be associated with better subsequent recall of the movie in the music group  relative to the control group. This work will provide basic-science insight into how memory works  in real-world contexts. It will also shed light on how musical cues can strengthen memories and  improve recall; if the predicted cueing effects are observed, these techniques could be used in  future work to boost performance in memory-impaired clinical populations. The effects of music on memory in naturalistic settings are not yet well understood. In this  project, we aim to study how memory for films is affected by the presence or absence of the film  score and whether these effects can be measured neurally. This work will help develop new  neural measures of music-evoked episodic memory as well as expand our understanding of music's  effect on memory under natural conditions.",The effects of film music on neural activity in higher-order brain areas and comprehension for the film narrative,10071610,F99NS118740,"['Affect ', ' Association Learning ', ' Award ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Chronology ', ' Control Groups ', ' Cues ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Hearing ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Infant ', ' Learning ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Memory ', ' Modernization ', ' Music ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Play ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' sound ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Film ', ' Comprehension ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Phase ', ' Memory Deficit ', ' memory dysfunction ', ' Memory impairment ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' participant recruitment ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Shapes ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Investigation ', ' Event ', ' Distant ', ' Sensory ', ' Techniques ', ' Postdoc ', ' Research Associate ', ' post-doc ', ' post-doctoral ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' Episodic memory ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' memory retrieval ', ' memory recall ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' movie ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' theories ', ' portability ', ' Data ', ' Retrieval ', ' Behavioral ', ' Behavioral Paradigm ', ' markov model ', ' Population ', ' Mind ', ' cognitive neuroscience ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' preservation ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' learning algorithm ', ' ']",NINDS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,F99,2020,46520,NJ-12,0.044235734261837065
"Motion Sequencing for Neuropsychiatric Drug Development SUMMARY Neuropsychiatric disorders afflict more than 20% of the global population, resulting enormous personal and societal burdens, including trillions of dollars in total costs. Despite its prevalence and widespread impact, the development of drugs to treat neuropsychiatric diseases significantly lags behind other disease areas. This gap is due primarily to the fact that so few candidate drugs ever make it to the clinic; the average lag time for those that do make it is 13 years, further exacerbating the problem. The success rate for psychiatric drugs is historically low, even as financial investments in the area rise. Developing safe and effective drugs for neuropsychiatric disorders is inherently difficult, as it relies on characterizing the behavioral phenotypes of animal models. Current approaches to this are low-throughput, unreliable, expensive, and minimally informative. Most methods attempt to reduce complex behaviors that depend upon many neural circuits into one or a few quantifiable metrics, which are then used to predict how the candidates will impact the even more complex human nervous system. Syllable Life Sciences was founded on the vision of improving the way we measure and interpret changes in the behavior in the lab to improve pre-clinical drug development. To address this challenge, we have developed a behavioral analysis platform called Motion Sequencing (MoSeq). MoSeq combines machine vision and unsupervised machine learning techniques to objectively identify a set of stereotyped three-dimensional behavioral motifs (rears, turns, head-bobs, runs, pauses, etc.) that encapsulates all the spontaneous actions of mice within a particular experiment. In addition to revealing which motif (termed a “behavioral syllable”) is expressed at each moment, MoSeq identifies the statistics that govern how syllables transition from one to anther over time (“behavioral grammar”). Using MoSeq, therefore, we can comprehensively and quantitatively profile rodent behavior. Our previous work demonstrates that MoSeq directly reflects ongoing brain activity in psychiatry- relevant brain circuits, and that it may significantly outperform more standard methods of phenotyping drug effects in mice. In this SBIR Phase I project, we propose to extend the capabilities of MoSeq and explicitly demonstrate its translational value. Specifically, in Aim 1 we will expand the purview of MoSeq to include neuropsychiatry-relevant circuits; in Aim 2 we will build a behavioral space that describes relationships among drugs spanning the current psychopharmacopeia; and in Aim 3 we will demonstrate the clinical utility of MoSeq by using it to predict clinical trial outcomes. This project will lay essential groundwork for revolutionizing the preclinical pipeline for neuro- and psychotherapeutics. NARRATIVE Syllable Life Sciences is committed to addressing key preclinical bottlenecks that hinder neuropsychiatric drug development. Key to this is to develop more efficient and accurate ways to identify and measure drug impact on behavior in model systems. Motion Sequencing (MoSeq) integrates state-of-the-art 3D cameras and novel machine learning techniques to track changes in rodent behavior in response to drug, and it does so with unprecedented levels of accuracy and temporal resolution.

"The cerebro-cerebellar-basal-gangliar network for visuomotor learning ABSTRACT Visual learning is critical to the lives of human and non-human primates. Visuomotor association, the assignment of an arbitrary symbol to a particular movement (like a red light to a braking movement), is a well- studied form of visual learning. This proposal tests the hypothesis that the brain accomplishes visuomotor associative learning using an anatomically defined closed-loop network, including the prefrontal cortex, the basal ganglia, and the cerebellum. In our preliminary work we have developed a task that studies how monkeys learn to associate one of two novel fractal symbols with a right hand movement, and the other symbol with a left hand movement. Every experiment begins with the monkeys responding to two overtrained symbols that they have seen hundreds of thousands of times. At an arbitrary time we change the symbols to two fractal symbols that the monkey has never seen. It takes the monkey 40 to 70 trials to learn the new associations. In our preliminary results we have discovered that Purkinje cells in the midlateral cerebellar hemisphere track the monkeys’ learning as they as they figure out the required associations. The neurons signal the result of the prior decision. Half of the neurons respond more when the prior decision was correct; the others respond more when the prior decision was wrong. The difference between the activity of these two types of neurons provides a cognitive error signal that is maximal when the monkeys are performing at a chance level, and gradually becomes not different from zero as the monkeys learn the task. The neurons do not predict the result of the impending decision. Although the neurons change their activity dramatically at the symbol switch, the kinematics of the movements do not change at all. This proposal takes this discovery as the starting point for four aims: 1) to use viral transynaptic tract tracing to discover the cortical and basal ganglia regions that project to the cerebellar visuomotor association area. 2) to record from the four nodes of the network as anatomically defined (midlateral cerebellar hemisphere, dentate nucleus, basal ganglia, prefrontal cortex), simultaneously, using multiple single neuron recordings, to see if these areas also have information about the process of visuomotor association 3) to inactivate each node, to see how their inactivation affects the monkey’s ability to learn new associations, and whether the inactivation affects the activity of the neurons at the other nodes. 4) to develop computational methods to analyze the activity of neural activity recorded simultaneously in all four nodes of the network (Aim 2) in the midlateral cerebellar cortex with regard to parameters such as prior outcome and movement, hand, symbol, and the intensity and epoch of the prior cognitive error signal. We will use dimensional reduction techniques to answer questions like whether hand or symbol can be decoded from network activity. We will model how the cerebellum simple spike cognitive error signal might propagate through the network and be used to facilitate visuomotor association learning and the processing of signals in the cerebellum, basal ganglia and cerebral cortex Project Narrative Learning that a particular object cues a particular action, as a red light makes us stop walking or brake the car, is critical for human behavior and can be degraded by human disease. This project will apply physiological, computational, and anatomical methods to investigate a brain network for visual learning. We will find the exact areas of the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum that participate in this learning, and use machine learning techniques to understand how the activity of neurons recorded simultaneously in these brain areas can facilitate learning.",The cerebro-cerebellar-basal-gangliar network for visuomotor learning,9983219,R01NS113078,"['Affect ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Association Learning ', ' Basal Ganglia ', ' Basal Nuclei ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cerebellar Cortex ', ' Cerebellum ', ' Cerebral cortex ', ' Cognition ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' classical conditioning ', ' Associative Learning ', ' Pavlovian conditioning ', ' associative conditioning ', ' Cues ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Exhibits ', ' gamma-Aminobutyric Acid ', ' 4-Aminobutanoic Acid ', ' 4-Aminobutyric Acid ', ' 4-amino-butanoic acid ', ' Aminalon ', ' Aminalone ', ' GABA ', ' γ-Aminobutyric Acid ', ' Grant ', ' Hand ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Learning ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' working memory ', ' Methods ', ' Monkeys ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Muscimol ', ' Agarin ', ' Pantherine ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Purkinje Cells ', "" Purkinje's Corpuscles "", ' cerebellar Purkinje cell ', ' Rabies virus ', ' Reaction Time ', ' Response RT ', ' Response Time ', ' psychomotor reaction time ', ' Reading ', ' Reflex action ', ' Reflex ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Suggestion ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Virus ', ' Work ', ' Walking ', ' nucleus dentatus ', ' Dentate nucleus ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' Left ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Fractals ', ' Failure ', ' Visual ', ' non-human primate ', ' nonhuman primate ', ' Agonist ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' cognitive function ', ' Dimensions ', ' Parietal ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Viral ', ' visual learning ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' kinematic model ', ' kinematics ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' Motor ', ' Cognitive ', ' Computational Technique ', ' computational analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computer analyses ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' To specify ', ' Process ', ' Outcome ', ' visuomotor ', ' visual motor ', ' human disease ', ' locomotor learning ', ' motor learning ', ' motor control ', ' signal processing ', ' cognitive process ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' Injections ', ' eMERGE Consortium ', ' eMERGE Network ', ' Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network ', ' motor behavior ', ' ']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,1025216,NY-13,0.005431355273041856
"Reinforcement learning and action sequencing in subcortical and cortical circuits Behaviors such as action selection and action sequencing require the shaping of dynamical neural activity patterns through learning. Understanding how such learning occurs is challenging due to the involvement of multiple brain areas and due to the fact that such behaviors involve multiple timescales, from the granular level of moment-to-moment limb control to the cognitive level of goal-driven planning. Modern experiments, which are able to record from large numbers of neurons in behaving animals, and in some cases to do so simultaneously in multiple brain areas and throughout the learning of a task, are providing a path forward for addressing these challenges. The overall goal of my research is to facilitate the synthesis and understanding of data from such experiments by constructing models of the brain circuits relevant for a given behavior, addressing how the neural activity in these circuits relates to behavior and how it is shaped over time through learning. In recent work, I have developed expertise in learned dynamics in neural circuits through three related lines of research. First, I have modeled the neural computations underlying timing-related behavior and its implementation in the basal ganglia. Second, I have mathematically derived biologically plausible learning rules to underlie supervised learning of time-dependent tasks in recurrent neural networks. Finally, I have worked on a theory- experiment collaboration in which modeling with recurrent neural networks was used in tandem with brain-machine interface experiments in monkeys to address the structure of neural representations within primary motor cortex. In future work, I will build on this experience to address how dynamical neural activity patterns are learned in order to produce complex behaviors over both short and long timescales. One way to begin addressing this question is with the theory of reinforcement learning, which provides a rich and powerful framework for addressing how actions should be performed in order to maximize future rewards. Given their established role in implementing reinforcement learning, the basal ganglia form the starting point for my proposed research program. I first aim to revise the classical model of basal ganglia function by constructing and mathematically analyzing models that solve computationally challenging tasks and by comparing the results with new data from my experimental collaborators (Aim 1). Building on this work and making use of my prior experience training recurrent neural networks to model motor tasks, I will next consider learning in motor cortex and how it complements learning in basal ganglia (Aim 2), again comparing models with new experimental data. Finally, I will construct models of the thalamocortico-basal ganglia circuit by incorporating knowledge about the neural representations throughout this circuit and by leveraging recent advances in machine learning. In this way, I will address how the mammalian brain implements hierarchical reinforcement learning to integrate behaviors over short and long timescales (Aim 3). Taken together, this research will advance understanding of how neural activity facilitates action selection and sequencing in complex behaviors. Behaviors involving action selection and action sequencing require the shaping of dynamical neural activity patterns through learning. Understanding how such learning occurs is challenging because multiple brain areas are involved and because such behaviors may involve multiple timescales, from low-level limb movements to the cognitive level of goal-driven planning. By developing circuit models of the basal ganglia and their cortical inputs, using new data from my experimental collaborators to inform and test these models, and drawing on recent advances in reinforcement learning from the field of machine learning, I will advance the understanding of how learned motor behaviors are implemented in the brain.",Reinforcement learning and action sequencing in subcortical and cortical circuits,9871193,K99NS114194,"['Affect ', ' Animals ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Basal Ganglia ', ' Basal Nuclei ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Striatum ', ' striatal ', ' Decision Making ', ' Dopamine ', ' Hydroxytyramine ', ' Limb structure ', ' Extremities ', ' Limbs ', ' Non-Trunk ', ' Forelimb ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Modernization ', ' Monkeys ', ' Motor Cortex ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Play ', ' Publishing ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Research ', ' Rewards ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' Training ', ' Stimulus ', ' Collaborations ', ' Shapes ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' experience ', ' field based data ', ' field learning ', ' field test ', ' field study ', ' limb movement ', ' Performance ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Modeling ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' theories ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematic model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematical model ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Cognitive ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Output ', ' behavioral monitoring ', ' Behavior monitoring ', ' brain machine interface ', ' Population ', ' Synaptic plasticity ', ' neural model ', ' locomotor learning ', ' motor learning ', ' math analysis ', ' mathematics analysis ', ' mathematical analysis ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' recurrent neural network ', ' neural network ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' supervised learning ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' Computer Models ', ' motor behavior ', ' ']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K99,2020,124157,NY-13,-0.11813412323453351
"The interactive roles of the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex during reversal learning As animals move about in the environment, they must be able to rapidly assess and update the meaning of cues around them in order to approach reward and avoid danger. Reversal learning, a paradigm commonly used to test behavioral flexibility, involves switching the association between a stimulus and its outcome. For example, a tone that initially predicted a sweet tastant can come to predict a bitter tastant. Two brain regions, the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and basolateral amygdala (BLA), are involved in tasks that demand flexible responses to the changing significance of stimuli during reversal learning. While several studies have provided evidence that the OFC and BLA interact during reversal learning, little is known about the specific mechanisms of this interaction. In this grant, we propose to use a combination of genetic and cellular imaging techniques in mice to identify and characterize the physiological response properties during reversal learning of BLA neurons that project to OFC. The reversal learning task we employ involves stimuli of multiple modalities that predict outcomes of both positive and negative value to thoroughly elucidate the differential response properties of BLA neurons to stimuli that change their associated reinforcement outcome (Aim 1). In these experiments, the physiological response properties of neurons identified as projecting from BLA to OFC will be compared to the response properties of the overall population. Then, using an optogenetic approach, we will test the causal role of OFC input onto BLA neurons during reversal learning by inhibiting the specific projections from OFC to BLA to test their causal role on behavioral flexibility and on the nature of representations in BLA (Aim 2). The data analysis for both aims involves collaboration with theoretical neuroscientists to use linear classifiers and other sophisticated techniques to understand the nature and dynamics of neural encoding in BLA and its relation to behavior. These experiments promise to shed light on the mechanisms by which cortico-amygdalar circuits mediate flexibility critical for adaptive emotional responses and behavior, an ability that is impaired in individuals with psychiatric disorders. This grant investigates the dynamic interactions between orbitofrontal cortex and the amygdala during a reversal learning task involving both rewarding and aversive outcomes. The study promises to elucidate mechanisms fundamental to the flexible updating of emotional behavior, mechanisms that likely become dysfunctional in psychiatric disorders.",The interactive roles of the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex during reversal learning,9842566,R21MH116348,"['Amygdaloid structure ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Animals ', ' Desire for food ', ' Appetite ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Calcium ', ' Cues ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Dissection ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Genetic Techniques ', ' Genetic Technics ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Head ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Learning ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Maintenance ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Patients ', ' Quinine ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Research ', ' Reversal Learning ', ' Rewards ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' PTSD ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' post-trauma stress disorder ', ' posttrauma stress disorder ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Sucrose ', ' Saccharose ', ' Testing ', ' Virus ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Auditory ', ' Sensory ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Performance ', ' Viral Genetics ', ' virus genetics ', ' fluorophore ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' expectation ', ' behavioral test ', ' behavior test ', ' Modality ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Emotional ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' Brain region ', ' Mechanisms of Behavior and Behavior Change ', ' behavior mechanism ', ' Behavioral Mechanisms ', ' Data ', ' Update ', ' Monitor ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cell imaging ', ' cellular imaging ', ' Behavioral ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' 2-photon ', ' two-photon ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Impairment ', ' neurotoxic ', ' Implant ', ' lenses ', ' lens ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' optogenetics ', ' genetic strategy ', ' genetic approach ', ' emotional behavior ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' outcome prediction ', ' anatomical imaging ', ' anatomic imaging ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' ']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2020,202500,NY-13,0.023914940083650832
"Mechanisms of Active Sensing in Drosophila The goal of this project is to study the cellular basis of active sensation. A crucial function of all nervous systems is to distinguish between sensory stimuli originating from the external world and that generated by our own movements. This task relies on brain circuits that integrate sensory information with an internal model, or expectation, of self-generated movements. The complexity and intractability of many models used to study active sensing means that translating insights from these studies to failures of normal nervous system function remains challenging. Fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) actively move their antennae, and my recent work has elucidated a neural circuit that processes mechanosensory information from the antenna. Given the power of Drosophila as a genetic model organism, this project aims to develop the neural circuits controlling and sensing antennal movement as a cellular model for studying principles of active sensing. In the K99 (mentored) portion of this grant, I will identify the cellular location at which self- versus externally-generated mechanosensory signals become differentially represented in the brain. I will make electrophysiological recordings of intracellular activity from 2nd and 3rd order mechanosensory neurons and compare how these two populations encode passive and active movements of the antennae. I will distinguish between these two types of movements using machine learning analysis of simultaneously recorded video data. For the R00 (independent) phase, I will use optogenetics and immunohistochemistry to identify motor neurons that control antennal movement. I will then ask where input from motor neurons impinge on the sensory circuit. Finally, I will test the role of active antennal movements in behavior. By perturbing active antennal movements in freely walking and flying flies, I will directly test how these movements enable different behavioral tasks such as wind orientation and obstacle avoidance. Together, these experiments will identify the cellular basis for active sensing in Drosophila, and their role in goal- oriented behaviors. The goal of the proposed research is to understand the principles that permit nervous systems to distinguish external from internally-generated sensory stimuli. Here I propose to develop a small circuit model of this process using the antennal mechanosensory system of the fruit fly. The insights gained from a tractable genetic circuit model will enable us to understand how these mechanisms fail in disease, supporting the BRAIN Initiative’s mission to understand the neural circuit basis of a critical brain function.",Mechanisms of Active Sensing in Drosophila,10012952,K99NS114179,"['Animals ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Drosophila genus ', ' Drosophila ', ' fruit fly ', ' Drosophila melanogaster ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Fingers ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Hand ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immunohistochemistry ', ' Immunohistochemistry Cell/Tissue ', ' Immunohistochemistry Staining Method ', ' Insecta ', ' Insects ', ' Insects Invertebrates ', ' Learning ', ' Mechanoreceptors ', ' Mentors ', ' Mission ', ' Study models ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Genetic Models ', ' Motor Neurons ', ' Motor Cell ', ' motoneuron ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Muscle ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' muscular ', ' Nervous system structure ', ' Nervous System ', ' Neurologic Body System ', ' Neurologic Organ System ', ' Nervous System Physiology ', ' Neurologic function ', ' Neurological function ', ' nervous system function ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Afferent Neurons ', ' Sensory Cell Afferent Neuron ', ' Sensory Neurons ', ' Neurotransmitters ', ' Nerve Transmitter Substances ', ' Odors ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Esthesia ', ' Sensation ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Stains ', ' Staining method ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Environmental Wind ', ' Wind ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Walking ', ' Mediating ', ' goal oriented behavior ', ' Label ', ' sensor ', ' Phase ', ' Failure ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Genetic ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Sensory ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Clampings ', ' Closure by clamp ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' flying ', ' Flying body movement ', ' Speed ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' perceptual stimulus ', ' physicochemical phenomena related to the senses ', ' sensory stimulus ', ' Touch ', ' tactile sensation ', ' Touch sensation ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Resolution ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Flies ', ' fly ', ' Population ', ' Cellular model ', ' Cell model ', ' optogenetics ', ' Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies initiative ', ' BRAIN initiative ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' ']",NINDS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,K99,2020,134007,NY-12,-0.15676230489441006
"Building analysis tools and a theory framework for inferring principles of neural computation from multi-scale organization in brain recordings Summary The BRAIN initiative is enabling ground-breaking techniques for brain recordings that will permit a unique view onto the dynamics of neural activity. However, inferring brain function from multi-channel physiological recordings is challenging. A key difficulty is that individual neurons and mesoscopic, often rhythmic, cell populations interact in complicated and recurrent ways. Such complex neuronal dynamics is hard to analyze but very likely important to the functioning of the brain. This proposal will address this problem by developing (1) tools for analyzing brain activity; (2) a theoretical framework for expressing underlying computations and generating experimental predictions. The starting point of the project is our earlier discovery that phase structure in oscillatory local field potentials (LFP) of hippocampal areas CA1/CA3 carry location information in exquisite detail (Agarwal et al. 2014). We will release software tools that make the methods for phase decoding and extracting meaningful LFP components available to the broader community. Further, in collaboration with experimental labs we will research the mechanistic underpinnings of this discovery in hippocampus (Buzsaki NYU, Foster, UC Berkeley), and explore how similar approaches can leverage phase diversity in cortical gamma oscillations (Fries, MPI Frankfurt). The research goal is to develop analysis tools for decoding and extraction of functional components (Aims 1 and 2), applicable to a broad range of multivariate brain recordings of hippocampal and cortical activity. Further, we will develop a flexible two-level theory framework with software tools (Aim 3) to help neuroscientists, in particular experimenters, to formulate putative abstract computations underlying a brain function under study, and build a concrete mechanistic circuit model of those computations. The computational description level will leverage ideas of vector symbolic architectures, a class of connectionist models originally proposed for describing cognitive reasoning (Plate, 1995; Kanerva, 1996). Models produced by the software tool will concisely encapsulate assumptions about the computation and its implementation of a brain function and produce predictions that can be tested in a next generation of recording experiments. The proposed theory framework will be tested in building models for navigation in hippocampus and for visual processing in areas V1 and V4 in cortex. Project narrative: A key difficulty with inferring brain function from recordings of neural activity in a working brain is that the dynamics of individual neurons and mesoscopic, often rhythmic, cell populations interact in complicated and recurrent ways. Here we address this problem by delivering new tools for decoding and decomposing neural population activity, leveraging the recent discovery by the PI of behavior-specific phase structure of local field potentials.

"CRCNS: Closed-Loop Computational Neuroscience for Causally Dissecting Circuits Despite substantial progress characterizing neural responses, it is particularly challenging to determine  causal interactions within recurrently connected circuits due to the confounding influence of the  interconnections. This proposed project pioneers a nascent field of closed-loop computational neuroscience that enables real-time feedback stimulation during experiments to decouple recurrently connected elements and make stronger causal inferences about their interactions. Specifically, the  contributions of this project will include: Aim 1) Using modern unsupervised machine learning methods to fit latent state dynamical system models of population responses under closed-loop stimulation. The  developed techniques will be used to clamp firing rate in genetically targeted inhibitory interneurons  across S 1 cortical laminae in the mouse to map the causal effect of inhibitory cells on the sensory gain in  excitatory cells. Aim 2) Merging and extending tools from network feedback control and causal inference  to identify functional connections between network nodes using realistic experimental constraints.

"Decoding the neural mechanism underlying variable action selection in Drosophila. Project Summary/Abstract There is a fundamental gap in our understanding of how complex, multi-action, behavioral variability is generated by neural circuits in the brain. Understanding this process is crucial to understanding how many neurological diseases cause restricted and inappropriate selection of actions. The goal of this proposal is to understand how populations of neurons control the behavioral variability in action selection for complex behaviors. We will utilize the fruit fly to investigate this question because despite having a much simpler brain than humans, the fruit fly performs complex behaviors with high variability. We have found that activating just 24 neurons in the fruit fly brain causes variable expression of four distinct aggressive actions: stopping, wing elevation, leg extension, and lunging. The relative simplicity of this system is ideal for pin-pointing the contribution of different sources of variability: cell-autonomous stochasticity in action potential generation, variability at a network-level or variability in muscles or other neurons affected by the 24 neurons. To test these sources for variability, the project will consist of three main aims. The first is to determine whether the actions are discrete states of behavior or lie within a continuum by using advances in machine learning and neuroethology to automate the identification of the aggressive behavioral actions and the transitions between these actions. The second is to test the hypothesis that each action is caused by neurons with similar neuroanatomical connections using neuroimaging, genetic manipulation, and controlled behavioral experiments. The third is to use functional imaging, in vivo electrophysiological recordings, and computational modeling to determine the neural basis for the variability of behavior. By combining theory, experimentation, and modeling, we will be able to provide a systems level explanation of the logic behind why animals perform different actions despite consistent levels of neuronal activation. Project Narrative The ability to flexibly and appropriately perform action selection is altered in many neurological and psychiatric diseases. However, the mechanism behind the variability in action selection while performing complex behaviors is not understood.

"Multimodal, integrated analysis of neural activity and naturalistic social behavior in freely moving mice Project Summary/Abstract  This proposal responds to an NIMH notice NOT-MH-18-036 aimed at the development and study of novel, computationally defined behavioral assays, and at applying theory and mathematical modeling to better capture the richness of complex, naturalistic behaviors. Specifically, we aim to develop novel computational tools for analyzing social behaviors in freely moving mice, and relating those identified behaviors to neural circuit activity in brain regions that govern the expression of those behaviors. Social behavior is affected in many human psychiatric disorders, such as autism, schizophrenia, and depression. We propose an interdisciplinary, collaborative approach to fill two major gaps that present a barrier to studies of social behavior: 1) the lack of quantitative and high-resolution descriptions of naturalistic social behaviors in freely moving animals, and 2) the difficulty of relating neural activity recorded in deep subcortical regions that govern such behaviors, such as the hypothalamus and extended amygdala, to animals' actions or to models of behavioral control. Our objective is to create a computational behavior analysis platform that integrates automated measurement of naturalistic social behavior, synchronous large-scale recording or imaging of neural activity, and apply these to a novel assay to investigate social behavioral decision-making. The central objective of this proposal is to extend our Mouse Action Recognition System (MARS) to create a platform that allows facile training of supervised and unsupervised behavior classifiers, quantitative correlation with simultaneously acquired neural recording or imaging data, and which can be flexibly adapted to additional behavior assays. The rationale for this approach is that fine-grained quantification of social behavior, and its correlation with neural recordings, is necessary to form and test theories of behavioral control by subcortical brain regions. While automated tracking and “pose” estimation software such as DeepLabCut have made tracking of animals' body positions more feasible, the identification of social behaviors from pose data is a non-trivial problem, requiring a separate computational approach that takes into account the relative movements of multiple animals over time. To achieve our objective, we will broaden the palette of social behaviors MARS can detect using machine learning and generative models (Aim 1), develop methods to relate those behaviors to neural activity (Aim 2), and extend MARS to additional assays to study neural correlates of social decision-making. This contribution is significant because it will create a resource that will transform our ability to study micro- and meso-scale subcortical circuits controlling social behavior. The contribution is innovative because it combines expertise from circuit neuroscience and computer vision/machine learning to create new tools for understanding the link between neural activity and behavior, in a context that is relevant to understanding dysfunctions of neural circuits that underlie human psychiatric disorders. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because it develops new methods to investigate the neural circuits governing naturalistic social behaviors in animal models, and such behaviors are often disrupted in human psychiatric disorders such as autism, schizophrenia, and depression. Our objective is to use computer vision and machine learning algorithms (AI) to produce detailed and reproducible measurements capturing the richness of social behaviors, and to correlate those behaviors with simultaneously recorded neural activity in freely interacting animals. We apply these techniques in established and novel social behavior assays to test hypotheses about the neural mechanisms underlying social behavioral decision-making.","Multimodal, integrated analysis of neural activity and naturalistic social behavior in freely moving mice",10037486,R01MH123612,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Animals ', ' Behavior ', ' Animal Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Calcium ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communities ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Decision Making ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hypothalamic structure ', ' Hypothalamus ', ' hypothalamic ', ' Joints ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Motivation ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Population Dynamics ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Social Behavior ', ' sociobehavior ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' Social Identification ', ' Social Identity ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Supervision ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Psychological Transfer ', ' learning transfer ', ' training transfer ', ' Work ', ' Triad Acrylic Resin ', ' Triad ', ' Triad resin ', ' Measures ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Measurement ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Behavioral Manipulation ', ' behavioral control ', ' Behavior Control ', ' Hour ', ' Complex ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' neural control ', ' neural regulation ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuroregulation ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' social ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematic model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematical model ', ' body position ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Control Animal ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Resolution ', ' Collection ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Behavioral Model ', ' Behavioral Assay ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' neural dysfunction ', ' Neuronal Dysfunction ', ' Reciprocal Social Interaction ', ' neural mechanism ', ' neuromechanism ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' user-friendly ', ' multi-modality ', ' multimodality ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' behavior study ', ' behavioral study ', ' neural correlate ', ' temporal resolution ', ' time measurement ', ' temporal measurement ', ' collaborative approach ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' Grain ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' social defeat ', ' social structural ', ' socio-structural ', ' sociostructural ', ' social structure ', ' ']",NIMH,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2020,416250,CA-27,-0.13154661817824403
"Receptors, microcircuits and hierarchical connectivity in predictive coding and sensory awareness SUMMARY The standard view of how we make sense of the world around us focuses on reconstructing our environment from the information received by our sensory organs. In this view, low-level brain areas (e.g., primary sensory cortex) represent basic features of objects, which are elaborated on in successive processing stages, until representations become increasingly complex in high-level areas (e.g., frontal cortex). An alternative view is predictive coding (PC), in which we model our environment to generate sensory predictions. In PC, high-level brain areas generate predictions of sensory activity and transmit them to low-level areas. A prediction that does not match the sensory information gives rise to a prediction error. This error signal is sent from low- to high-level brain areas to update the model of our environment, thereby improving future predictions to minimize errors. Modeling studies show PC is a fast and efficient way to process sensory information, and PC provides innovative hypotheses for understanding sleep and anesthesia, particularly when disconnected consciousness occurs (consciousness without awareness of the environment), like dreaming. PC also holds great promise for conceptualizing and treating brain disorders, including schizophrenia and depression. But key central features of PC have not been empirically tested and little is known about the underlying neural mechanisms. The goal of the proposed project is to characterize the neural dynamics, circuits and receptors enabling PC. There are two principle hypotheses. First, predictions depend on N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR) because NMDAR influence the activity of high-level brain areas where predictions are generated, and NMDAR are enriched on neurons in lower-level areas receiving predictions. Second, in disconnected consciousness, a breakdown of information transmission from low-level to high-level brain areas, as well as a breakdown of computations within each area, explains why models of our environment are not updated by external sensory information. These breakdowns prevent the comparison of predictions and sensory information, as well as the transmission of prediction errors to high-level brain areas. To test these hypotheses, we use a cross-species experimental design connecting cellular, circuit and systems levels to behavior. We will perform electroencephalography, machine learning and computational modeling to define the neural basis of PC in humans performing prediction tasks. Then we will manipulate PC using different anesthetic agents with diverse mechanisms, establishing causal relationships between receptors, large-scale brain networks and PC. In parallel, we will simultaneously record activity from sensory and high-level brain areas of non-human primates (NHPs) using the same PC tasks and pharmacological interventions to measure cellular and circuit level contributions to PC. Investigating PC will illuminate the fundamental mechanisms of perception, providing critical insights to guide therapeutic development for multiple health conditions. NARRATIVE This research advances our understanding of how the brain generates predictions which shape how we perceive the world, otherwise known as predictive coding. Predictive coding is relevant to public health because it holds great promise in conceptualizing and treating brain disorders, including depression, schizophrenia, delirium and dementia, as well as understanding sleep and anesthesia. Progress in understanding the basic mechanisms of predictive coding, as well as predictive coding deficits, is a necessary step in developing more effective treatment strategies for multiple health conditions.","Receptors, microcircuits and hierarchical connectivity in predictive coding and sensory awareness",10034682,R01NS117901,"['Anesthesia procedures ', ' Anesthesia ', ' Anesthetics ', ' Anesthestic Drugs ', ' Anesthetic Agents ', ' Anesthetic Drugs ', ' Auditory area ', ' Auditory Cortex ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Cues ', ' Delirium ', ' delirious ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Dreams ', ' dreaming ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Environment ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Feedback ', ' frontal lobe ', ' frontal cortex ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Interneurons ', ' Connector Neuron ', ' Intercalary Neuron ', ' Intercalated Neurons ', ' Internuncial Cell ', ' Internuncial Neuron ', ' Ketamine ', ' Macaca ', ' Macaque ', ' Study models ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Parietal Lobe ', ' parietal cortex ', ' Perception ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Propofol ', ' Diprivan ', ' Disoprofol ', ' Public Health ', ' Reaction Time ', ' Response RT ', ' Response Time ', ' psychomotor reaction time ', ' Adrenergic Receptor ', ' Adrenoceptors ', ' Epinephrine Receptors ', ' adenoreceptor ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' sedative ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Sleep ', ' Temporal Lobe ', ' temporal cortex ', ' Testing ', ' Thalamic Nuclei ', ' Unconscious State ', ' Unconscious ', ' Unconsciousness ', ' consciousness loss ', ' Measures ', ' N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptors ', ' N-Methylaspartate Receptors ', ' NMDA Receptor-Ionophore Complex ', ' NMDA Receptors ', ' Mediating ', ' Dexmedetomidine ', ' Pulvinar ', ' pulvinar thalami ', ' Pulvinar structure ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Consciousness ', ' Conscious ', ' Individual ', ' non-human primate ', ' nonhuman primate ', ' Agonist ', ' Shapes ', ' sedation ', ' Sedation procedure ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Auditory ', ' Complex ', ' Sensory ', ' System ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' innovative technologies ', ' experience ', ' human data ', ' paired stimuli ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' receptor ', ' sensory cortex ', ' visual stimulus ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' perceptual stimulus ', ' physicochemical phenomena related to the senses ', ' sensory stimulus ', ' Modality ', ' Reporting ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Sensory Process ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Target ', ' Update ', ' Monitor ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Process ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Disinhibition ', ' neural mechanism ', ' neuromechanism ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' postsynaptic ', ' therapeutic agent development ', ' therapeutic development ', ' treatment strategy ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' neural correlate ', ' multielectrode arrays ', ' multi-electrode arrays ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' Computer Models ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2020,517182,WI-02,-0.03047872372699127
"Emergence of Functional Network Dynamics from Single Cell Properties Project Summary/Abstract The collective dynamics of the network of neurons in the brain drive its primary holistic function — control of organismal behavior. Pathologies of the nervous system that disrupt this coordinated activity result in dysfunctional patterns of motor output and gross behavior. However, it is unknown how patterns of coordinated activity arise from the properties of single neurons and their connections. In the next five years we seek to develop a rigorous theory and biologically realistic model of the emergence of coordinated dynamics in a complete network of neurons, similar to the current level of understanding of how the dynamics of interacting molecular species produce goal-directed motile behavior in single-cell bacteria. We focus on the relatively simple nervous system of C. elegans; with precisely 302 neurons, it is a natural choice for such fundamental neurodynamical studies. To attack this problem, the research in our lab utilizes a fusion of experimental and computational approaches including advanced microscopy, genomic engineering, machine learning based image processing, quantitative behavior, and dynamical systems analysis. We have developed novel approaches to quantitatively probe and characterize the signal processing properties of single neurons as well as record and quantify the activity of the entire C. elegans nervous system at single-cell resolution using volumetric calcium imaging under genetic perturbation. We are now exploring the relationship between the microscopic properties of cellular signaling and the macroscopic function of collective network dynamics. A mechanistic model of the composition and maintenance of structured, controlled brain dynamics would provide a framework for understanding how gross neurological disease states arise from cellular and molecular dysfunction. Project Narrative A basic theory and data driven model of the emergence of collective, coordinated network dynamics based on the properties of neurons is lacking.

"Neural Encoding of Social Information PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Vocal communication plays a pivotal role in shaping the dynamics of social interactions and is impaired in a wide range of neurological disorders. Consequently, a major component of translational research focuses on identifying circuit-level neurobiological mechanisms underlying social communication deficits. Determining the neural mechanisms underlying social communication deficits requires both understanding the functions of neural circuits as well as the ability to link neural circuits to specific naturalistic behaviors. However, obtaining this information has been challenging because of the difficulties in interpreting complex behavioral interactions in freely socializing animals. The long-term goal of this research is to understand the neural circuitry controlling naturalistic social behaviors directly influenced by communication. This could ultimately allow communication disorders to be treated by therapeutically targeting atypically functioning neural circuitry. In pursuit of this goal, the overall objective in this proposal is to determine how social communication is encoded in the nervous system and the role it plays in shaping behavior. The proposal uses a novel microphone array system to track the vocal behavior of freely socializing, individual adult mice—a technique that has eluded the field for 50 years. Coupling this innovative method with in vivo wireless electrophysiology and machine-learning techniques used for robustly extracting meaningful social information will enable identification of the neural circuits that encode social communication and the role communication plays in directly shaping social behavior. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that mice emit behavior-dependent vocalizations that directly alter the social dynamics between animals. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that behaviorally-dependent vocalizations are encoded in the CA2 subregion of the hippocampus. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that the lateral entorhinal cortex, one of the primary cortical inputs to CA2, encodes the locations of vocalizations in egocentric reference frames. The proposed research will have a broad impact as these studies will provide fundamental insight into the neurobiological basis of social communication. Moreover, these experiments will lay the groundwork for future studies examining the neural basis of social communication in mouse models of neurological disorders, such as schizophrenia, Parkinson’s disease, and autism spectrum disorders. Project Narrative:  Understanding the fundamental principles governing social communication is of paramount importance as deficits in expressive and receptive vocal communication skills are hallmark characteristics of a wide range of neurological disorders. The proposed experiments aim to determine the direct impact of social communication on behavior and delineate how neural circuits encode social communication. Ultimately, knowledge gained from the proposed project has the potential to inform and hasten the discovery of novel therapeutic approaches that will help reduce the burdens of human disability.",Neural Encoding of Social Information,9962011,R01MH122752,"['Acoustics ', ' Acoustic ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Agonistic Behavior ', ' Animals ', ' Behavior ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Communication ', ' Communication impairment ', ' Communication Disorders ', ' Communicative Disorders ', ' Cues ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Animal Disease Models ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Methods ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Nervous system structure ', ' Nervous System ', ' Neurologic Body System ', ' Neurologic Organ System ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Parkinson ', "" Parkinson's disease "", ' Parkinsons disease ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Pheromone ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Social Behavior ', ' sociobehavior ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Socialization ', ' sound ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Entorhinal Area ', ' entorhinal cortex ', ' Lateral ', ' Medial ', ' Link ', ' disability ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' non-human primate ', ' nonhuman primate ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Auditory ', ' Complex ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' vocalization ', ' experience ', ' adult animal ', ' mature animal ', ' free behavior ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' neural function ', ' Neurophysiology - biologic function ', ' Touch ', ' tactile sensation ', ' Touch sensation ', ' social ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' response ', ' deprivation ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' in vivo ', ' Cognitive ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Research ', ' wireless ', ' Wireless Technology ', ' Characteristics ', ' Behavioral ', ' affiliative behavior ', ' neural mechanism ', ' neuromechanism ', ' social communication ', ' Coupling ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' murine model ', ' mouse model ', ' therapeutic target ', ' neurobiological mechanism ', ' new therapeutic approach ', ' new therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic strategies ', ' new therapy approaches ', ' novel therapeutic approach ', ' novel therapy approach ', ' novel therapeutic intervention ', ' optogenetics ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' source localization ', ' microphone ', ' behavior phenotype ', ' behavioral phenotyping ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE,R01,2020,578956,DE-00,-0.0812915989419627
"The Human Foveal Connectome The complex relationship of cone photoreceptor cells with retinal circuits, Müller glia, and retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells is essential to normal vision. Yet for the cones in the very center of the fovea that mediate peak visual acuity these relationships are poorly characterized. A longstanding barrier to a comprehensive understanding of cellular and subcellular foveal structure is the myriad interactions among a great diversity of cell types embedded and miniaturized within a complex three-dimensional architecture. The broad long-term objective of this new research program is to elucidate foveal microstructure directly by application of new methods of volume electron microscopy (connectomics). We will utilize retinal tissue acquired from an innovative organ donor program that will permit pre-recovery optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging to assess retinal health status and foveal pit morphology and to guide connectomic reconstruction. Preliminary data from two donor eyes demonstrates feasibility of complete reconstructions of foveal cones and their associated synaptic pathways, Müller cells, and RPE cells. The first reconstructions of cone microcircuits from an adult born preterm indicate that the critical cells and synaptic pathways for foveal vision differ dramatically in structure and localization anticipated from previous work on non-human primates. Therefore in Aim 1 we propose to localize, identify and reconstruct quantitatively the synaptic visual pathways that arise from the central-most foveal cones. We will characterize all of the bipolar and ganglion cell circuits arising from these cones and test the new hypothesis that the dominant “midget” pathway subserving spatial acuity may be highly variable across individuals in both circuitry and pit localization. We will further test the hypothesis that beyond the midget circuit the foveal center gives rise to over twenty distinct but as yet uncharacterized visual pathways. The first reconstructions of Müller cells revealed the intimate wrapping of cone axons and abundance of processes in the plexiform layer and foveal floor. In Aim 2 we propose complete reconstructions of Müller cells to test the hypotheses that the foveal floor contains a novel Müller cell type restricted to inner retina and that morphology of individual Müller cells and their foveal distribution accounts for the macular pigment distribution. The first reconstructions of RPE cells provided new insights on the distribution of organelles important in clinical OCT and autofluorescence imaging. Therefore, in Aim 3 we propose to reconstruct and enumerate organelles in RPE cells in the cone-only fovea and the mixed rod-cone perifovea. We will directly test the hypothesis that RPE organelle content and distribution differs between cone-only fovea and rod-rich perifovea, accounting for the appearance of OCT bands and for topography of autofluorescence signal in clinical imaging. This proposal combines expertise and innovation in neurobiology, pathology, imaging, and connectomics. Outcomes will impact retinal neurobiology, clinical image interpretation, and pathophysiology of macular diseases, especially age-related macular degeneration. The human fovea is essential for best vision but understanding the crucial cellular interactions among photoreceptors, neural circuits and supporting non-neural cells in the foveal center is limited because the extremely miniaturized and complex three-dimensional structure and synaptic organization of this region is difficult to untangle with conventional methods. The proposed project will apply new methods of volume electron microscopy (“connectomics”) to reconstruct the human fovea for the first time. Outcomes will have broad significance for retinal neuroscience, clinical image interpretation, and the pathophysiology of macular disease, especially age-related macular degeneration.",The Human Foveal Connectome,9883529,R01EY028282,"['Accounting ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Aging ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Axon ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Female ', ' Floor ', ' fovea centralis ', ' Fovea ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Lipofuscin ', ' male ', ' Melanosomes ', ' Methods ', ' Electron Microscopy ', ' Miniaturization ', ' Miniaturisations ', ' Mitochondria ', ' mitochondrial ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Organ Donor ', ' Organelles ', ' Photoreceptors ', ' Photoreceptor Cell ', ' Photosensitive Cell ', ' Visual Receptor ', ' Pigments ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Retina ', ' Retinal Diseases ', ' Retinal Disorder ', ' retina disease ', ' retina disorder ', ' retinopathy ', ' Structure of retinal pigment epithelium ', ' Outer pigmented layer of retina ', ' Pigment cell layer of retina ', ' Pigmented layer of retina ', ' Retinal Pigment Epithelium ', ' Retinal pigment epithelial cells ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Visual Acuity ', ' Visual Pathways ', ' Work ', ' Mediating ', ' density ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Apical ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Cone Photoreceptors ', ' cone cell ', ' Retinal Cone ', ' Link ', ' gangliocyte ', ' ganglion cell ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' non-human primate ', ' nonhuman primate ', ' Recovery ', ' Age-Related Maculopathy ', ' age related macular dystrophy ', ' senile macular disease ', ' Age related macular degeneration ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Morphology ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Rods and Cones ', ' Vertebrate Photoreceptors ', ' Catalogs ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' cell type ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Location ', ' Services ', ' Muller glia ', ' Müller cell ', ' Müller glia ', "" Muller's cell "", ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Appearance ', ' disorder of macula lutea ', ' macula abnormality ', ' macula lutea abnormality ', ' macular disease ', ' macular disorder ', ' maculopathy ', ' disorder of macula of retina ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' miniaturize ', ' Doppler OCT ', ' OCT Tomography ', ' optical Doppler tomography ', ' optical coherence Doppler tomography ', ' Optical Coherence Tomography ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Supporting Cell ', ' cell morphology ', ' Cellular Morphology ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' reconstruction ', ' macular ', ' macula ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' 3-D structure ', ' 3-dimensional structure ', ' 3D structure ', ' three dimensional structure ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' visual performance ', ' postsynaptic ', ' imaging in vivo ', ' in vivo imaging ', ' Cone ', ' connectome ', ' clinical imaging ', ' pathology imaging ', ' Rod ', ' ']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2020,505976,WA-07,-0.09845661552971352
"Intelligent connectomic analysis tool for dense neuronal circuits Intelligent Connectomic Analysis Tool for Dense Neuronal Circuits Project Summary: The lack of basic understanding of neuronal functions and disease processes is a big factor of failures in creating drugs for neurological diseases. High-resolution maps of the complex connectivity of neuronal circuits correlating with functional and/or molecular markers offer invaluable insights into the functional organization of the neuronal structures, which is a key to understanding the brain in health and disease. There is a strong interest in elucidating and quantifying the connectomics of brain networks with subcellular resolution using electron microscopy (EM) and correlate with functional fluorescence microscopy data. The ultimate goal is to elucidate human brain functions and the mechanisms of human brain disorders. This is critically important to enable new diagnostics and therapies for brain disorders.  The reconstruction and analyses of neuronal networks is challenging in part due to the joint requirement of large volume and high resolution and a large gap in connectomic analysis solutions. There is a strong need for next generation, well supported, integrated, easy to use and highly automated analysis tools to detect and classify neurons, trace arbor branches, identify synapses, spines and synaptic vesicles that increase the throughput of otherwise prohibitively time-consuming analyses in connectomic experiments. There is also a strong need for tools to perform downstream data-driven analysis such as functional inference from structure and phenotypic discovery.  Powered by machine learning and DRVision innovations and collaborating with Dr. Rachel Wong and 9 additional labs, this project proposes to create an intelligent connectomic analysis (ICA) tool optimized for dense neuronal circuits.

"Role of Piriform Cortex Perineuronal Nets in Mouse Social Communication. Rett Syndrome (RTT) is diagnosed as a neurodevelopmental disorder, characterized by partial or complete loss of acquired spoken language, acquired motor skills and stereotypic hand movements. Mutations in X-linked gene methyl CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2), a chromatin remodeler and gene regulator, is the causative gene for typical RTT. RTT is hypothesized to be the result of altered synaptic connectivity and plasticity caused by abnormal experience-dependent synapse development and maintenance. However, few experimental paradigms have explored how synaptic plasticity in RTT is affected over time and physiological changes with cellular, circuit and behavioral level granularity. Using Mecp2-null and heterozygous mouse models, we have previously shown that MECP2 regulates the timing of experience-dependent plasticity in the adult auditory cortex in a learned maternal behavior paradigm. We found that Mecp2-heterozygous females (SurHet) were inefficient gatherers, likely due to atypical auditory perception, caused by an abnormal, transient increase in numbers of mature perineuronal nets (PNNs). PNNs are extracellular matrix structures that act as physical barriers for plasticity, and form predominantly around cortical parvalbumin GABAergic neurons. Major questions remain: Pup retrieval behavior is a complex sequence of events involving auditory, tactile, olfactory senses and goal-directed motor events. How do different sensory inputs (pup vocalizations, feel and smell of pups) contribute to the motor outputs (adult vocalizations, goal-directed search and carrying pups by mouth to the nest)? Our aims in this R15 proposal are to (1) characterize vocalizations/syllables and interactions between pups and adult females during pup gathering task, using integrated analysis of audio and video recordings with new machine learning algorithms; (2) identify the time line of altered PNN expression in piriform cortex, a brain region thought to be important for olfactory coding and a relay station for multisensory integration using immunostaining/imaging and then, surgical manipulations of piriform cortex. We hypothesize that expression of mature PNNs in the piriform cortex is regulated by MECP2 and contribute to proper integration and functioning of distinct components of pup retrieval behavior. The results from this study aims to identify novel circuits and mechanisms involved in multisensory integration of vocal communication during complex social behavior, which are one of the most striking yet underexplored phenotypes in RTT. Relevance to health: Rett Syndrome is diagnosed as a neurodevelopmental disorder with sensory, motor and social impairments; however, it is currently unknown where and how these impairments develop and change over time in adulthood. This proposal aims to understand how plasticity, the ability of the brain to incorporate and adapt to changes in its environment and surroundings, is affected by mutated genes in RTT and associated neurological disorders. Rett syndrome is a neurological disorder caused by mutations in methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2). The overall goal is to determine how MECP2 deficiency results in altered experience-dependent plasticity, critical for learning and navigating one's social environment, and to observed stereotypic RTT phenotypes.",Role of Piriform Cortex Perineuronal Nets in Mouse Social Communication.,10045956,R15MH124042,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Auditory area ', ' Auditory Cortex ', ' Auditory Perception ', ' hearing perception ', ' sound perception ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cognition ', ' Communication ', ' Cues ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Environment ', ' Extracellular Matrix ', ' Cell-Extracellular Matrix ', ' ECM ', ' Female ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' regulatory gene ', ' trans acting element ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Hand ', ' Health ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Maintenance ', ' male ', ' Manuals ', ' Maternal Behavior ', ' middle age ', ' mid life ', ' mid-life ', ' middle aged ', ' midlife ', ' Modernization ', ' Motor Skills ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Persons ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Parvalbumins ', ' Pathology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Research ', ' Rett Syndrome ', ' Cerebroatrophic Hyperammonemia ', ' Rett Disorder ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Smell Perception ', ' Olfaction ', ' Smell ', ' odor perception ', ' olfactory perception ', ' Social Behavior ', ' sociobehavior ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Speech ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Time ', ' Video Recording ', ' Videorecording ', ' video recording system ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' TimeLine ', ' Caring ', ' MeCP-2 protein ', ' MeCP2 ', ' MeCP2 protein ', ' Methyl CpG Binding Protein 2 ', ' Methyl CpG binding protein MeCP2 ', ' Methyl-CpG binding protein 2 ', ' Methyl-DNA binding protein MECP2 ', ' Methyl-CpG-Binding Protein 2 ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' Buccal Cavity ', ' Buccal Cavity Head and Neck ', ' Cavitas Oris ', ' Mouth ', ' Oral cavity ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' programs ', ' Tactile ', ' Auditory ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Sensory ', ' Route ', ' vocalization ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' experience ', ' piriform cortex ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' social ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Modeling ', ' girls ', ' social cognition ', ' chromatin remodeling ', ' Brain region ', ' Ultrasonic ', ' Ultrasonics ', ' Motor ', ' Mutate ', ' Retrieval ', ' in vivo ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Neurological Development Disorder ', ' Neurodevelopmental Disorder ', ' Behavioral ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Motor output ', ' social communication ', ' stereotypy ', ' Synaptic plasticity ', ' Impairment ', ' endophenotype ', ' murine model ', ' mouse model ', ' pup ', ' motor control ', ' multisensory ', ' undergraduate ', ' undergraduate student ', ' differentially expressed ', ' transcriptional differences ', ' differential expression ', ' sensory input ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE KNOXVILLE,R15,2020,450753,TN-02,-0.015747596505718147
"Crossing space and time: uncovering the nonlinear dynamics of multimodal and multiscale brain activity The brain is a complex dynamical system, with a hierarchy of spatial and temporal scales ranging from microns and milliseconds to centimeters and years. Activity at any given scale contributes to activity at the scales above it and can influence activity at smaller scales. Thus a true understanding of the brain requires the ability to understand how each level contributes to the system as a whole. Most brain research focuses on a single scale (single unit firing, activity in a circuit), which cannot account for the constraints imposed by activities at other scales. The goal of this proposal is to develop a framework for the integration of multiscalar, multimodal measurements of brain activity. One of the challenges in understanding how activity translates across scales is that features that are relevant at one scale (e.g., firing rate) do not have clear analogues at other scales. We address this issue by defining trajectories in “state space” at each scale, where the state space is defined by parameters and time scales appropriate to each type of data. The trajectory of brain activity through state space can uncover features like attractor dynamics and limit cycles that characterize the evolution of activity. Using machine learning along with new and existing multimodal measurements of brain activity (MRI, optical, and electrophysiological), we propose to establish methods that relate trajectories across scales while handling the mismatch in temporal sampling rates inherent in multi-scale data. Specific aims are 1. Create and test a tool for learning how trajectories at fast scales influence activity at slower scales. Different modalities have different inherent temporal resolutions in addition to different types of contrast. Current methods generally downsample the faster modality in some way, losing much information in the process. We will leverage variants on long short-term memory (LSTM) network architectures to learn the relationship between state space trajectories acquired simultaneously with population recording and optical imaging, and with optical imaging and fMRI. 2. Create and test a tool for learning how trajectories at slow scales influence activity at faster scales. Leveraging the same LSTM-based approach, we will learn how slower, larger scale activity affects activity at smaller scales, using whisker stimulation as a test case. We anticipate inclusion of the large scale activity (measured with fMRI or optical imaging) will improve prediction of the response at smaller scales (measured with optical imaging or population recording). Our work will allow us to begin to answer a wide range of questions about how the brain functions (e.g., what type of localized stimulation that will drive the brain to a desired global state? How does modulation of the global brain state affect local information processing?) and provide guidance for future experiments by identifying key features that influence activity across scales. By approaching the whole brain as a complex dynamical system, we will break free from the limitations of previous studies that focus on individual cells or circuits. We also expect our work to stimulate new theories that incorporate multiple scales of activity. The brain is a complex, dynamical system that exhibits structured activity at many different space and time scales. Most existing studies focus on a single scale (for example, spiking of individual neurons or activity in a particular circuit). However, interactions occur across scales and may account for much of the variability observed in the brain. This proposal will develop a framework for integrating data from different scales using machine learning tools. The results will improve our understanding of how the brain functions and serve as a foundation for modeling neuromodulatory treatments for brain disorders.",Crossing space and time: uncovering the nonlinear dynamics of multimodal and multiscale brain activity,10007011,R01EB029857,"['Affect ', ' Arousal ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Evolution ', ' Exhibits ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Vibrissae ', ' Whiskers ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Non-linear Dynamic ', ' Non-linear Dynamics ', ' Nonlinear Dynamic ', ' Nonlinear Dynamics ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' analog ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Msec ', ' millisecond ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' neural control ', ' neural regulation ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuroregulation ', ' Structure ', ' Modality ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' optic imaging ', ' optical imaging ', ' Population ', ' somatosensory ', ' brain research ', ' tool development ', ' information processing ', ' multi-modality ', ' multimodality ', ' network architecture ', ' Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies initiative ', ' BRAIN initiative ', ' temporal resolution ', ' time measurement ', ' temporal measurement ', ' dynamical system ', ' dynamic system ', ' prediction of response ', ' predictive response ', ' predictor of response ', ' response prediction ', ' predicting response ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' neural network ', ' long short term memory ', ' long short term memory neural network ', ' long short term memory network ', ' multi-modal data ', ' multi-modal datasets ', ' multimodal datasets ', ' multimodal data ', ' large data sets ', ' large datasets ', ' multi-scale data ', ' multiscale data ', ' ']",NIBIB,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,1124452,GA-05,-0.036443002333180895
"Modeling and mapping multiple computational processes in human reinforcement learning Project Summary Learning from rewards is one of the fundamental roles of the nervous system, allowing for beneficial behaviors to be repeated, and detrimental behaviors to be avoided. It has recently become clear that when humans learn from rewards in the environment, they rely on multiple neural systems that work in tandem. What are the psychological and biological constraints of these systems, and how do they interact during learning? The proposed experiments are designed to answer these questions by developing precise computational models of human instrumental learning, as well as investigating the neural dynamics of, and interactions between, individual learning processes. Aim 1 will focus on isolating individual learning processes, further developing a novel model of human instrumental learning that highlights contributions to learning from both a flexible executive working memory module and an incremental reinforcement learning module. Behavioral experiments and computational modeling will be used to better characterize these two learning processes, with a focus on how they interact instantaneously and over time. Aim 2 will use a combination of brain stimulation and neuroimaging to better characterize the neural systems supporting each learning process, as well as the putative interactions between these neural circuits. These results will constrain our understanding of the neural mechanisms that drive human instrumental learning. The knowledge gained by this project will provide a vital framework for clinical applications, for instance, in understanding and treating working memory related learning deficits in schizophrenia, and reinforcement learning deficits in Parkinson's disease. Critically, a more precise model of individual learning processes could guide the development of clinical protocols that leverage intact learning systems when other learning systems are compromised. Finally, an enhanced understanding of human reward-based learning could improve theories of habit formation, which may further inform psychological and neurophysiological models of addiction. Project Narrative This project will examine how multiple learning systems (e.g. working memory, incremental reinforcement learning) guide human instrumental learning, model these multiple learning systems computationally, and investigate their respective underlying neural mechanisms. The results will be useful not only for a better scientific understanding of learning deficits in psychological disorders like schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease, but also for developing improved clinical protocols for leveraging intact neural circuits when others are compromised. Furthermore, an improved description of human reward-based learning will be relevant to understanding how habits are formed and reinforced, which may inform our understanding of the acquisition of addictive behaviors.",Modeling and mapping multiple computational processes in human reinforcement learning,9882891,F32MH119797,"['Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Basal Ganglia ', ' Basal Nuclei ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Choice Behavior ', ' Clinical Protocols ', ' Operant Conditioning ', ' Instrumental Learning ', ' instrumental conditioning ', ' Dopamine ', ' Hydroxytyramine ', ' Environment ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Habits ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Learning ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' working memory ', ' Methods ', ' Study models ', ' Nervous system structure ', ' Nervous System ', ' Neurologic Body System ', ' Neurologic Organ System ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Parkinson ', "" Parkinson's disease "", ' Parkinsons disease ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Play ', ' Psychology ', ' Psychophysics ', ' psychophysical ', ' Reaction Time ', ' Response RT ', ' Response Time ', ' psychomotor reaction time ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Research ', ' Rewards ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Addictive Behavior ', ' Mediating ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Series ', ' Individual ', ' Exposure to ', ' Attenuated ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Event ', ' Scanning ', ' Parietal ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' stimulus/response ', ' Response to stimulus physiology ', ' visual stimulus ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Categories ', ' Social Support System ', ' Support System ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' visuomotor ', ' visual motor ', ' Mind ', ' neural mechanism ', ' neuromechanism ', ' clinical applicability ', ' clinical application ', ' addictive disorder ', ' addiction ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' Education Module ', ' Educational Module ', ' Teaching Module ', ' Learning Module ', ' cognitive process ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' clinical development ', ' recruit ', ' model of human ', ' human model ', ' learning algorithm ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' Computer Models ', ' in silico ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,F32,2020,20742,CA-13,-0.045264112998308806
"Genetic Dissection of Cortical Parvalbumin Interneuron Subtypes Abstract The inhibitory control and dynamic tuning of cortical circuits is mediated by a diversity of GABAergic cell types, but the biological basis of interneuron identity and diversity is not well understood. Here, we combine developmental genetic, anatomic and transcriptomic approaches to define and discover bona fide cell types within a broad class of cortical interneurons. Parvalbumin containing, fast-spiking basket cells (PVCs) are the largest population of interneurons in the neocortex and integrate in infragranular, granular (layer IV), and supragranular circuits, each with unique input/output connectivity. Recent findings from our laboratory and others suggest heterogeneity in PVC morphology, synaptic properties, and connectivity, but it is uncertain how many of these represent distinct subtypes. Using a developmental genetic strategy, we take advantage of the inside-out laminar specification of PVCs to identify and characterize subtypes based on lineage and birth time restricted cohorts. PVCs are derived from the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE), and the transition from progenitor to differentiated neuron is marked by the upregulation of proneural transcription factors. By intersecting inducible Ascl1-CreER and Dlx1-CreER mice with PV-Flp mice and an intersectional reporter and inducing in mid-to-late embryogenesis, we have begun parsing adult laminar PVC subtypes for multifactorial single-cell analysis. We quantify the laminar position and morphology of lineage restricted and birth-dated PVC cohorts. We will also carry out single cell RNAseq to analyze their transcription profiles. The integration of morphological and anatomical characterization with single cell RNAseq will increase our understanding of cell identity in PVCs and can potentially uncover new underlying cellular properties. Because PVCs are implicated in schizophrenia, autism, and other mental disorders, their complete profiling at the single cell level could aid in understanding pathophysiology and suggest better treatment strategies. Project Narrative Public Health Relevance: About 1 in 5 Americans are afflicted with mental health disorders such as schizophrenia, Alzheimer’s disease, and autism, placing a considerable burden on individuals and health care institutions across the country. Parvalbumin interneurons are the most prevalent inhibitory cells in the neocortex and their dysfunction implicated across many disorders, though their precise circuit integration is not well understood. This research proposal will lay the foundation for a single-cell understanding of the individual cell types that underlie this powerful “brake” mechanism and identify specific molecular targets that can hopefully lead to better therapeutic strategies.",Genetic Dissection of Cortical Parvalbumin Interneuron Subtypes,9853835,F31MH114529,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ',

"Understanding Multi-Layer Learning in a Biological Circuit Work on learning in neural systems has focused largely on the effects of plasticity at synapses that provide direct input to the neurons being studied. Learning a model of the environment or a complex skill, however, relies on plasticity that is widely distributed and may occur at synapses far from the neurons driving decisions or actions. As is well-known from multi-layer (or 'deep') artificial networks, distributing learning over multiple layers is substantially more powerful but also more difficult to implement than learning at a single layer. The fact that computer scientists have solved such problems has revolutionized artificial intelligence and is rapidly reshaping the human world. Understanding how the brain solves such problems is, undoubtedly, one of the biggest challenges facing neuroscience today. However, progress along these lines has been slow, due in part to the high degree of complexity of learning and memory circuits in mammals, such as hippocampus and neocortex, that have been a major focus of research. This proposal applies integrated experimental and theoretical approaches to a system with unique advantages for understanding learning in multi-layer networks. The electrosensory lobe (ELL) of mormyrid fish is the site of a continual learning process that predicts and cancels self-generated sensory input in order to enhance detection of behaviorally-relevant stimuli. Building on this knowledge, we propose to develop a model of the ELL spanning from cellular biophysics to network dynamics with the goal of explaining how synaptic plasticity widely distributed across processing layers and cell types gives rise to learning. To accomplish this, we will leverage cutting-edge approaches for mapping synaptic connectivity at high-resolution and monitoring neural population activity over the entire time course of learning. The proposed research is expected to yield general insight into how sophisticated forms of learning are implemented in neural circuits. This proposal seeks to understand how sophisticated forms of learning are implemented in neural circuits.

"CRCNS: US-Japan Research Proposal: The Computational Principles of a Neural Face Processing System There is a fundamental gap in our understanding of the computational principles and neural mechanisms by which neural circuits represent complex objects like faces. This conceptual gap constitutes an important problem because, until it is filled, we will not be able to understand face recognition and the reasons for face blindness. The long-term goal is to understand the computational principles and neural mechanisms of face recognition and create a computer face-recognition system based on these principles. The overall objective of this proposal is the determination of the computational principles of local and global face feature coding in the brain's face-processing network. The central hypothesis is that high-level feature tuning in face-selective areas can be understood as the result of the statistical properties of stimulus space and general organizational features of the circuits that process these stimuli. The rationale for this proposal is that completion of the proposed research will provide an understanding, of how neural circuits generate a meaningful representation of complex visual shape, imposing critical constraints on theories of vision. The hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims, which will determine 1) neural mechanism for facial feature tuning, 2) neural mechanism for categorical face selectivity, and 3) neural mechanisms for transformations of feature tuning. The joint computational and experimental approach will integrate functional magnetic resonance imaging to localize face areas with electrophysiological recordings targeted to these regions and computational analyses of model systems. The approach is innovative through the tight coupling of theoretical principles and experimental validation and by developing novel theoretical and experimental methodologies. The proposed research is significant, because it will unravel principles of neural circuit function that are of general relevance for understanding visual object recognition and multi-node networks. Because the outcome is an advance in understanding circuit mechanisms of social perception, it will identify vulnerabilities of the face-processing system directly relevant to the understanding of face blindness, prosopagnosia, and of altered social perception in syndromes spanning autism spectrum disorders, fragile X, and Williams syndrome. The proposed research is relevant to public health because the neural mechanisms of face processing are essential to human social life, and altered social perception is characteristic of many pervasive neurodevelopmental disorders. Studies proposed in this application will identify the computational principles of face recognition circuitry and suggest how alterations to these circuits impair function.

"Studying how the hippocampal-prefrontal-hypothalamic circuit encodes social dominance Project Summary Social deficits are common in psychiatric disorders and available treatments are limited. Our lack of basic knowledge on how the brain controls social behaviors makes it challenging to develop therapeutics for social deficits. For numerous animal species, social rank dictates many aspects of behavior, such as access to resources and resilience to stress. Individuals with higher social rank typically win more often during social conflicts (e.g. food competition) and show more agonistic behaviors; collectivity referred to as dominance behaviors. Cross-species evidence suggests that the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) plays an important role in social dominance. However, exactly how the mPFC encodes social rank and which mPFC inputs and outputs contribute to dominance behaviors is unknown. Multiple studies show that the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) is necessary for social memory, and more recently, a study showed that this role involves vHPC input to the mPFC. Furthermore, preliminary data suggest that the projection from the mPFC to the lateral hypothalamus (LH) modulates social dominance behavior. These findings in combination with the literature suggest a model in which the mPFC receives social memory information from the vHPC and guides social behaviors via modulation of LH GABAergic and glutamatergic subpopulations. Progress in uncovering neural correlates of social behavior has been limited by the tools used to characterize murine social behavior, since existing social assays lack trial- structure needed for statistical power and common measurements of social behavior are simplistic (e.g. sniffing). Overcoming this challenge required developing a trial-based social competition assay in which mice compete against cagemates for a reward signaled by a tone. Due to its trial structure, this assay facilitates the quantification of social behaviors and subsequently the identification of neural correlates for social dominance. In this assay, dominant mice win most of the rewards across trials, occupy the reward port and displace mice from the reward port more often than subordinates. Machine learning approaches will be used to profile the behavioral differences seen across social rank during the competition assay. Utilizing this ethologically relevant social competition assay, circuit manipulations, in vivo neural recording methods and machine learning allows testing the hypothesis that the tripartite vHPC-mPFC-LH circuit encodes social dominance. Altogether, this research will provide a new approach to study social dominance and will further our understanding of how the distributed circuits of the mPFC modulate social behavior. Furthermore, pinpointing the neural circuits underlying social behaviors will facilitate identification of potential therapeutics for social deficits in psychiatric disorders. Finally, completion of this research will provide training opportunities in statistical approaches for behavioral analysis and new circuit dissection tools, which are essential for the candidate to become an expert in social neuroscience and to start a successful independent research program. Project Narrative Social behavior deficits are key features of many psychiatric disorders, yet little is known about how the brain controls normal social behaviors. I propose to dissect the role of the medial prefrontal cortex circuits in social dominance by combining wireless electrophysiology, calcium imaging, optogenetics and machine learning. This study will broaden our understanding of how neural circuits control normal social behaviors and will contribute to the identification of novel interventions for social deficits.",Studying how the hippocampal-prefrontal-hypothalamic circuit encodes social dominance,10041744,K99MH124435,"['Affect ', ' Agonistic Behavior ', ' Animals ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Calcium ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Dissection ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Glutamates ', ' L-Glutamate ', ' glutamatergic ', ' Goals ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hypothalamic structure ', ' Hypothalamus ', ' hypothalamic ', ' Literature ', ' Memory ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Motivation ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Play ', ' Probability ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rewards ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Social Behavior ', ' sociobehavior ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' Social Dominance ', ' Dominance Hierarchy ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Opsin ', ' Rod-Opsin ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' Tube ', ' base ', ' Lateral ', ' Medial ', ' Site ', ' Phase ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' non-human primate ', ' nonhuman primate ', ' Bilateral ', ' Measurement ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Frequencies ', ' Techniques ', ' brain control ', ' mind control ', ' social competition ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' social ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' cell cortex ', ' Data ', ' in vivo ', ' wireless ', ' Wireless Technology ', ' Behavioral ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Output ', ' Behavioral Assay ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' social neuroscience ', ' resilience ', ' optogenetics ', ' imaging in vivo ', ' in vivo imaging ', ' neural correlate ', ' redshift ', ' training opportunity ', ' recruit ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' social defects ', ' social disorders ', ' social dysfunction ', ' social deficits ', ' social interventions ', ' ']",NIMH,SALK INSTITUTE FOR BIOLOGICAL STUDIES,K99,2020,123390,CA-49,-0.1529505561790333
"CRCNS: Inferring reference points from OFC population dynamics A key computation that all mammals perform is determining the value of different outcomes. People and animal models evaluate outcomes as gains or losses relative to an internal reference point, likely  reflecting their experience-based expectations. For example, if someone is told they will receive a particular salary at a new job, but when they start, they find that the salary is substantially less, they will view that salary (which is a net increase in wealth) as a loss relative to their reference point. Reference  dependence is a consequential, ubiquitous phenomenon, driving decisions about insurance, financial products, labor, and retirement savings. The proposed work seeks to uncover how large populations of neurons represent a cognitive variable –the reference point- during value-based decision-making. This work involves complementary, synergistic interactions between experimentalists and theorists in the labs  of Dr. Christine Constantinople and Dr. Cristina Savin, respectively.  This proposal will develop a novel behavioral paradigm for studying reference dependence in rats, enabling application of powerful tools to monitor large-scale neural dynamics. High-throughput behavioral training will generate dozens of trained subjects for experiments in parallel. We will also develop a  behavioral model to quantify key aspects of rats' behavior, including individual differences in behavior across animals (Aim 1). We will use new silicon probes with high channel counts (“Neuropixels” probes) to record from populations of neurons in dozens of rats during behavior. Recordings will be obtained from  the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), a key brain structure implicated in value-based decision-making. We will develop novel latent dynamics models that will infer the reference point directly from populations of simultaneously recorded neurons in OFC, without any knowledge of the task or rats' behavior. This model will also be able to identify aspects of neural dynamics that are common across dozens of rats, and  aspects that are variable across animals, reflecting individual differences in behavior (Aim 2). Finally, we  will use complementary, state-of-the-art machine-learning techniques to train recurrent neural networks (RNNs) on our behavioral and neural data. This approach will generate concrete hypotheses about the  neural circuit architectures performing reference-dependent subjective valuation in our task (Aim 3). Decision-making is disrupted in psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia & bipolar disorder.Moreover,  all major classes of psychiatric disorders are associated with disordered reward processing in the brain.  Therefore, a circuit-level understanding of how the brain computes and represents the reference point  during value-based decision-making has enormous consequences for human health, and may hold  promise for improving treatments for mental health disorders in which decision-making is impaired.",CRCNS: Inferring reference points from OFC population dynamics,10153974,R01MH125571,"['Affect ', ' Animals ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' Birds ', ' Aves ', ' Avian ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Capuchin Monkey ', ' Cebus ', ' Ring-Tail Monkey ', ' capuchin ', ' Choice Behavior ', ' Decision Making ', ' Decision Theory ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Insurance ', ' Mammals ', ' Mammalia ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Modernization ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Occupations ', ' Jobs ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Population Dynamics ', ' Rattus ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Rat ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Retirement ', ' Rewards ', ' Wages ', ' Salaries ', ' Savings ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Silicon ', ' Si element ', ' Testing ', ' Water ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Work ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Techniques ', ' experience ', ' behavioral measure ', ' behavioral measurement ', ' behavior measurement ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Modeling ', ' Consequentialism ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Behavioral Model ', ' Behavioral Paradigm ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Individual Differences ', ' Impairment ', ' Implant ', ' reward processing ', ' behavioral economics ', ' dynamical system ', ' dynamic system ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' preservation ', ' recurrent neural network ', ' ']",NIMH,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,337222,NY-12,-0.007258420147479573
"Deciphering the building blocks of the macaque prefrontal cortical microcircuit Abstract Since Ramon y Cajal, neuroscientists have speculated that even the most complex brain functions might even- tually be understood at the level of neuronal cell types and their connections. More recently, while we have be- gun to understand the wiring principles of cortical microcircuit in rodents at the level of cell types, we are still in infancy in understanding the circuit organization of the primate neocortex at the level of cell types and their connections, slowing the progress toward a mechanistic understanding of complex cognitive capabilities char- acteristic of primates. For instance, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) of the primate brain is the most evolutionarily developed brain region that supports complex cognitive processes characteristic of primates, such as reasoning, planning, and abstract thinking. However, we know little about the constituent cell types comprising DLPFC circuit, how each cell type connects each other to form a functional circuit, and what circuit components specific to this circuit endow it with superb computational capabilities for complex cognitive pro- cesses. To fill in this knowledge gap, we scale up a cost-effective, interdisciplinary approach to macaque DLPFC, aiming at identifying all its consitiuent cell types and decipher their connectivity rules, with emphasis on highly diverse GABAergic interneurons. We propose to use multi-cell patch recordings, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), novel and rapid viral GABAergic labeling, and machine learning to achieve two main goals: 1) dissect macaque DLPFC microcircuit by generating a morphological taxonomy of cell types in DLPFC and mapping their connections; and 2) derive transcriptomic signatures of morphologically defined DLPFC neurons using Patch-seq method, a novel scRNA-seq protocol. We have demonstrated the feasibility and suc- cess of this approach in mouse neocortex, and our preliminary data indicate no technical issue in applying this approach to primates. Using multi-cell patch recordings, we will characterize electrophysiology and morphology of thousands of neurons and map connections between tens of thousands of cell pairs from DLPFC. Using Patch-seq method, we will combine patch recording with a novel/sensitive scRNA-seq method (Smart-seq2) to simultaneously obtain electrophysiology, morphology and transcriptome from single neurons, which can further substantiate cell type classification and identify novel molecular markers for each cell type. We will prioritize our effort on superficial layers of DLPFC, but eventually scale up our efforts to all layers if time permits. At the end, the project will uncover a high-resolution microcircuit blueprint of macaque DLPFC with each circuit com- ponent identified by specific genetic markers. Such a comprehensive dataset will provide the essential ground- work to design molecular tools for further functional dissection of the complex cognitive processes subserved by PFC. From a clinical perspective, having reference transcriptomes and connectivity patterns for different cell types in primate DLPFC will facilitate our understanding of the relationship between disease-associated genes, cell types, and circuit deficits in neuropsychiatric diseases, schizophrenia in particular. Narrative The prefrontal cortex (PFC) of the primate is the most evolutionarily developed brain structure mediating complex cognitive functions characteristic of primates, such as reasoning and planning, while its malfunction is associated with devastating neuropsychiatric diseases including schizophrenia, depression, and Alzheimer disease. Despite its vital importance, we currently know very little about the constituent cell types populating the primate PFC and how they are wired together to mediate complex cognitive functions characteristic of primates. We propose to use a cost-efficient, multidisciplinary approach to decipher the cell type-specific wiring principles of the monkey PFC circuit at an unprecedented scale and level of detail, which could lead to a better circuit-level mechanistic understanding of complex functions subserved by primate PFC and more effective strategies for the treatment of devastating disorders, such as schizophrenia.",Deciphering the building blocks of the macaque prefrontal cortical microcircuit,9961670,R01MH120404,"[""Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Felis catus ', ' Cats ', ' Cats Mammals ', ' Domestic Cats ', ' Feline Species ', ' Felis domestica ', ' Felis domesticus ', ' Felis sylvestris catus ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Decision Making ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Dissection ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Genetic Markers ', ' genetic biomarker ', ' Goals ', ' Guns ', ' gun ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' In Vitro ', ' Interneurons ', ' Connector Neuron ', ' Intercalary Neuron ', ' Intercalated Neurons ', ' Internuncial Cell ', ' Internuncial Neuron ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Macaca ', ' Macaque ', ' Maps ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' working memory ', ' Methods ', ' Monkeys ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Perception ', ' Primates ', ' Primates Mammals ', ' Research ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Testing ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' Time ', ' Virus ', ' Work ', ' Mediating ', ' General Taxonomy ', ' Taxonomy ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' homotypical cortex ', ' isocortex ', ' neopallium ', ' Neocortex ', ' Label ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' infantile ', ' infancy ', ' Genetic ', ' Morphology ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' cognitive function ', ' Complex ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' Viral ', ' interest ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Morphologic Finding ', ' morphologic criteria ', ' morphologic signature ', ' morphological criteria ', ' morphological signature ', ' Physical shape ', ' Property ', ' Brain region ', ' ward ', ' GeneHomolog ', ' Homolog ', ' Homologue ', ' Homologous Gene ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Classification Scheme ', ' Cognitive ', ' Scheme ', ' cell morphology ', ' Cellular Morphology ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' Behavioral ', ' Expression Signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' gene expression signature ', ' transcriptional signature ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' scale up ', ' cost effective ', ' cost efficient ', ' transcriptomics ', ' neocortical ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multi-modality ', ' multimodality ', ' treatment strategy ', ' molecular biomarker ', ' molecular marker ', ' cognitive process ', ' cognitive capacity ', ' cortical map ', ' cortical mapping ', ' cortex mapping ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' transcriptome ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' high dimensionality ', ' Injections ', ' preservation ', ' scRNA-seq ', ' single cell RNA-seq ', ' single cell RNAseq ', ' single-cell RNA sequencing ', ' patch-seq ', ' patchseq ', ' patch sequencing ', ' ']",NIMH,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,400938,TX-09,-0.05470351722025434
"Using deep brain stimulation of the parietal cortex to investigate the electrophysiology of human episodic memory Project Summary Our proposal seeks to build upon the success of our lab investigating the electrophysiology of human memory through novel experiments that will elucidate hippocampal—parietal interactions in memory processing. The key innovations of this proposal are the application of direct brain stimulation to the mesial parietal cortex and the adaptation of an associative recognition paradigm to intracranial data. We will take advantage of our high-volume epilepsy surgical center specializing in stereo EEG electrode implantation. In our first aim, we will compare how electrophysiological patterns of brain activation differ between free recall (which comprises the bulk of intracranial memory data) and associative recognition, specifically examining properties of theta oscillations in the anterior versus posterior hippocampus. In the second aim, we will apply deep brain stimulation to the mesial parietal cortex during memory encoding and retrieval, observing differences in memory performance and hippocampal oscillatory activity that will inform hypotheses of how this area supports episodic memory. In Aim 3, we will use machine learning classifiers to understand how mesial parietal stimulation affects memory performance via its impact on brain oscillatory activity in a responsive stimulation paradigm. These experiments will utilize our lab’s knowledge and infrastructure gained through participation in the DARPA Restoring Active Memory project. While our proposal is highly innovative, our center’s proven success in recruiting a large volume of stereo EEG patients for memory research, data collection, and the application of advanced analytic techniques give us confidence that we will collect high quality data addressing the critical gaps in the understanding of human memory. Project Narrative Two critical gaps in our understanding of human memory are whether or not hippocampal theta oscillations support encoding in the same manner as in rodents, and the contribution of the mesial parietal cortex in encoding versus retrieval. These questions are closely linked together, and we propose to study them in stereo EEG patients using a novel memory paradigm coupled with deep brain stimulation. Our planned experiments include a closed-loop stimulation paradigm seeking to use parietal stimulation to improve memory performance, the results of which will both inform theories of human episodic memory processing and of the design of therapeutic brain stimulation devices to treat cognitive deficits.",Using deep brain stimulation of the parietal cortex to investigate the electrophysiology of human episodic memory,9980718,R01NS107357,"['Affect ', ' Aging ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Data Collection ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electrodes ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Exhibits ', ' Goals ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Literature ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic body system ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Parietal Lobe ', ' parietal cortex ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Societies ', ' Temporal Lobe ', ' temporal cortex ', ' Testing ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' Thalamus ', ' thalamic ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Lateral ', ' Anterior ', ' Area ', ' Animal Experiments ', ' Link ', ' analog ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Attenuated ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Deep Brain Stimulation ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Parietal ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' memory recognition ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Episodic memory ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' memory processing ', ' memory process ', ' memory retrieval ', ' cognitive defects ', ' Cognitive deficits ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' memory decline ', ' Memory Loss ', ' Property ', ' theories ', ' Brain region ', ' Effectiveness ', ' degenerative condition ', ' degenerative disease ', ' Degenerative Disorder ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Retrieval ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' direct application ', ' Coupled ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' implantation ', ' human disease ', ' memory encoding ', ' new therapeutic approach ', ' new therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic strategies ', ' new therapy approaches ', ' novel therapeutic approach ', ' novel therapy approach ', ' novel therapeutic intervention ', ' human imaging ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' recruit ', ' Infrastructure ', ' advanced analytics ', ' learning classifier ', ' ']",NINDS,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,356032,TX-30,0.03733364866758693
"Hippocampo-cortical circuit mechanisms of neuronal sequences during learning PROJECT SUMMARY  The goal of this project is to understand the circuit mechanisms underlying neuronal sequence coordination across hippocampus and neocortex and their role in learning and memory. Cells that participated in a recent experience are reactivated in the form of ordered sequences that recapitulate behavior in a temporally compressed manner. These reactivations are coordinated by synchronous network events known as sharp-wave ripples (SWRs) that originate in the hippocampus and propagate to the neocortex. It has been proposed that SWRs and associated neuronal sequences mediate memory consolidation, planning and learning but a direct proof of these functions is still lacking. Additionally, several brain disorders characterized by learning and memory deficits have been related to disrupted SWRs. To guide behavior and decision making, the neocortex is believed to generalize across individual experiences encoded in the hippocampus to infer environmental regularities and rules. SWRs entrain neocortical activity, but how downstream cortical areas read out the hippocampal code transmitted during SWRs and use this information to guide goal-oriented behavior is unknown.  I will perform silicon probe recordings and optogenetic manipulations in the hippocampus and its main cortical target regions of behaving rats and mice to test the functional role and circuit mechanisms of SWR sequences during the different phases of goal-oriented behavior. First, I will use a novel optogenetic approach for closed-loop manipulation of SWRs to directly test whether SWRs associated sequences support memory-guided behavior. My preliminary data supports the hypothesis that SWRs became longer with increased memory demands thus allowing extended replay events, and that those prolonged sequences are necessary and sufficient for memory-guided navigation and spatial learning. Second, I will examine the impact of SWRs on downstream cortical targets, in the context of goal-oriented spatial behavior. I will test if there is a specific functional topography of hippocampo-cortical interactions, with dorsal and ventral hippocampal SWRs propagating preferentially to retrosplenial and prefrontal cortices. I hypothesized that hippocampo –cortical synchrony during SWRs will gradually increase with learning and that this process could lead to the generation of abstract representations, or schemas, in the cortex that will facilitate future decisions. Finally, I will test whether SWR-associated cortical sequences are locally generated or inherited from the hippocampus and how different classes of interneurons contribute to them. To achieve this, I will record and optogenetically manipulate different cell sub-types in transgenic mice.  By using an innovative experimental approach, the proposed project will provide novel insights into the circuit mechanisms and behavioral role of neuronal sequences involved in learning and memory. This knowledge will also shed light into the mechanisms underlying memory deficits in neural disorders such as Alzheimer disease, schizophrenia and intellectual disability. It may also open new avenues for more targeted, closed-loop interventions in these disorders.  The scientific skills developed during the training period of this project will be crucial for the accomplishment of the immediate scientific goals and become the pillars for the research I will develop in my future independent laboratory. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this project is to understand how distributed brain circuits generate neuronal dynamics that support learning and memory. It will directly test if the sequential reactivation of cell assemblies that recapitulate experience is necessary for memory-guided behavior and elucidate how these sequences are coordinated on a global scale. These experiments will not only be important for understanding the physiological mechanisms of learning and memory in healthy brains but also how neuronal disorders such as Alzheimer or schizophrenia lead to their impairment.",Hippocampo-cortical circuit mechanisms of neuronal sequences during learning,9994009,K99MH120343,"[""Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Decision Making ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Interneurons ', ' Connector Neuron ', ' Intercalary Neuron ', ' Intercalated Neurons ', ' Internuncial Cell ', ' Internuncial Neuron ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Memory ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' working memory ', ' Methods ', ' Transgenic Mice ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Rattus ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Rat ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Silicon ', ' Si element ', ' Sleep ', ' Spatial Behavior ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Testing ', ' Generations ', ' Mediating ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' homotypical cortex ', ' isocortex ', ' neopallium ', ' Neocortex ', ' goal oriented behavior ', ' improved ', ' Dorsal ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Memory Deficit ', ' memory dysfunction ', ' Memory impairment ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Behavioral Manipulation ', ' behavioral control ', ' Behavior Control ', ' Knowledge ', ' Hereditary ', ' Inherited ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Intellectual disability ', ' Intellectual limitation ', ' intellectual and developmental disability ', ' Intellectual functioning disability ', ' Viral ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' cell assembly ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Brain region ', ' Data ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' neocortical ', ' neural patterning ', ' optogenetics ', ' memory consolidation ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' ']",NIMH,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,K99,2020,129087,NY-12,-0.010291226600347406
"Testing a model of cortico-basal ganglia support for juvenile imitative learning in zebra finches Project Summary/Abstract Juveniles acquire crucial skills by imitating skilled adults, as when infants imitate their parents' speech sounds. Evidence suggests that cortico-basal ganglia (CBG) circuitry critically supports this process both in general and specifically when juvenile zebra finches learn to imitate an adult tutor, an experimentally tractable phenomenon. A cortical pathway in juvenile zebra finches can generate stereotyped song that becomes more similar to tutor song over the course of learning. A song-dedicated CBG circuit influences activity in this pathway, acutely increasing the variability of song acoustics from rendition to rendition. My preliminary data suggest that the CBG circuit also acutely induces a directional shift in song acoustics, compared to song generated by the cortical pathway without CBG influence. The proposed experiments test the idea that the CBG drives rapid acoustic shifts, directed at the imitation target, that slowly consolidate in downstream motor cortical structures. To test this hypothesis, I have developed a (1) novel song analysis and (2) a novel longitudinal experimental design that uses (3) innovative optogentic techniques in this model system. These experiments have the potential to significantly advance our understanding of CBG support for zebra finch song learning, and to test CBG reinforcement learning models in a learning domain that does not require external reinforcement. Project Narrative Early in life, we must acquire crucial skills like speech by imitating adults, so neurological impairments of imitative learning can be debilitating. This proposal is relevant to human health because it will address how cortico-basal ganglia (CBG) circuitry supports juvenile imitative learning in a powerful laboratory model, song learning by zebra finches. Insight from the project's findings may improve our ability to relate CBG circuit biology to behavioral outcomes in normal and disordered juvenile imitative learning.",Testing a model of cortico-basal ganglia support for juvenile imitative learning in zebra finches,9911141,F31HD098772,"['Acoustics ', ' Acoustic ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Basal Ganglia ', ' Basal Nuclei ', ' Behavior ', ' Biology ', ' Birds ', ' Aves ', ' Avian ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Infant ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Parents ', ' Play ', ' Punishment ', ' Pupil ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Speech ', ' Speech Sound ', ' Stereotyping ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Opsin ', ' Rod-Opsin ', ' role model ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Adolescent ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' Failure ', ' insight ', ' zebra finch ', ' tool ', ' Life ', ' Scientist ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' vocalization ', ' Performance ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Motor Pathways ', ' Property ', ' vocal learning ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Viral Vector ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Neurological Development Disorder ', ' Neurodevelopmental Disorder ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Output ', ' vector ', ' neural mechanism ', ' neuromechanism ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' locomotor learning ', ' motor learning ', ' stem ', ' optogenetics ', ' behavior outcome ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' tutorial support ', ' tutoring ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' autoencoding neural network ', ' autoencoder ', ' ']",NICHD,DUKE UNIVERSITY,F31,2020,37429,NC-04,-0.07748977608794955
"2020 Neurobiology of Cognition Gordon Research Conference SUMMARY This proposal requests support for the Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on the Neurobiology of Cognition. The driving force behind the GRC is the rapid pace of convergent findings in molecular, cellular circuit and systems neuroscience, augmented by technical developments in cell-targeting, imaging, computation and brain-machine interfaces. As a result, there are rapidly evolving descriptions of neuronal circuits and dynamics, neurophysiological processes and computational principles that underpin cognitive functions. Together, these approaches that include different brain models, and levels of analyses and involve an interdisciplinary research community will get us closer to one of the ultimate goals of the field of cognitive neuroscience – to explain human cognition. The overarching goal of this GRC is to promote communication and collaboration across relevant levels of analysis and among empirical scientists, theoreticians and technical development specialists, emphasizing the most recent findings. The associated GRS, held just prior to the GRC, is designed to provide opportunities for doctoral and post-doctoral trainees to communicate their most recent findings and perspectives, and to prepare them for more in-depth participation in the parent GRC that immediately follows. Along with recent findings in traditional “core” areas such as memory and motor cognition, formal sessions will explore several new themes, including: 1) the role of subcortical structures such as the thalamus in perception and cognition, 2) a discussion on the many ways neural information may be encoded across different levels from local ensembles to large scale circuits, 3) an overview of recent developments to probe neural circuits beyond the traditional microelectrode recording including several brain models (rodents, non-human primates and humans), and 4) an exploration of the relation of our field to computer science and artificial intelligence. The program is highly interdisciplinary, bringing together behavioral, neuroimaging and electrophysiological techniques in humans and non-human animals with computational approaches that explicate empirical findings and construct realistic models to represent the developing picture of cognitive operations and guide future experimentation. The program also underscores novel, state-of-the-art experimental and theoretical approaches that promise to define fundamental principles of cognition, and to extend these to improved treatment of brain dysfunction. The format of the meeting promotes intensive interactions among investigators and trainees from different perspectives and analytic levels, and in particular, between experimentalists and theorists. HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT The goal of this conference is to promote communication and collaboration among empirical scientists and theoreticians working in the field of cognitive neuroscience with the focus on the improved understanding of the biological basis of perception, memory, motor cognition, decision-making and its relation to artificial intelligence. Insights into the neural basis of these fundamental cognitive processes, will lead to improved diagnoses and treatment of many cognitive disorders with profound implications for society, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and autism and will inform the further development of brain machine interfaces.",2020 Neurobiology of Cognition Gordon Research Conference,10070417,R13NS116969,"[""Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Animals ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cognition ', ' Cognition Disorders ', ' cognitive disease ', ' cognitive disorder ', ' cognitive syndrome ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Memory ', ' Microelectrodes ', ' Miniaturized Electrodes ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Parents ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Parkinson ', "" Parkinson's disease "", ' Parkinsons disease ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Perception ', ' Request for Proposals ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Societies ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' Thalamus ', ' thalamic ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' symposium ', ' Specialist ', ' career ', ' gene manipulation ', ' genetically manipulate ', ' genetically perturb ', ' genetic manipulation ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' non-human primate ', ' nonhuman primate ', ' Fostering ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Collaborations ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' cognitive function ', ' Scientist ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' cell type ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' meetings ', ' Postdoc ', ' Research Associate ', ' post-doc ', ' post-doctoral ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' computer science ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neuronal circuit ', ' neuronal circuitry ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' peer ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Modeling ', ' Brain region ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Motor ', ' Cognitive ', ' Physiologic Imaging ', ' physiological imaging ', ' Functional Imaging ', ' Monitor ', ' To specify ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' brain machine interface ', ' cognitive neuroscience ', ' driving force ', ' operation ', ' cognitive task ', ' cognitive process ', ' targeted imaging ', ' dysfunctional brain ', ' brain dysfunction ', ' ']",NINDS,GORDON RESEARCH CONFERENCES,R13,2020,15000,RI-02,-0.07903374356846543
"Impaired Astroglial Glutamate Signaling in Rett Syndrome ABSTRACT  Rett syndrome (RTT) is a leading cause of severe intellectual disability in women. Individuals with RTT develop  typically  until  6-­18  months,  when  autism-­like  behaviors  as  well  as  deficits  in  purposeful  hand  use  and  speech  start to develop. Loss-­of-­function mutations in the X-­linked transcriptional regulator methyl-­CpG-­binding protein   2 (MECP2) occur in >95% of RTT cases. Initially, MeCP2 deficiency in neurons was considered as the exclusive  cause of RTT, but recent studies have revealed that glial cells lacking functional MeCP2 also have a significant  pathological role in RTT etiology. However, specific cellular mechanisms of glial cell dysfunction underlying this  role  or  its  behavioral  consequences  have  not  been  identified.  In  this  study,  we  propose  to  examine  the  contribution of a specific glial subtype, astrocytes, to the dysfunction of the striatum responsible for motor deficits  in  a  Mecp2-­based  mouse  model  for  RTT.  Astrocytes  expressing  the  Slc1a2  gene  encoding  glutamate  transporter-­1 (GLT-­1, also EAAT2) have a pivotal role in regulating extracellular glutamate levels. We propose  to characterize the contribution of GLT-­1 dysfunction to glutamate signaling in conditional knockout (cKO) mice  lacking  Mecp2  only  in  astrocytes  using  a  combination  of  experimental  approaches,  including  whole-­cell  intracellular  recordings  and  optogenetics  in  striatal  slices,  time-­lapse  imaging  of  intracellular  Ca2+  and  extracellular glutamate and dopamine, near-­super resolution confocal microscopy, and quantitative behavioral  assessments  using  machine-­learning  classifiers.  Our  preliminary  results  indicate  lower  expression  levels  of  Slc1a2 in the striatum of constitutive Mecp2 KO mice, consistent with smaller GLT-­1-­mediated intracellular Na+  signals  and  membrane  currents  in  striatal  astrocytes.  Intriguingly,  Mecp2  cKO  mice  show  higher  locomotor  activity  in  the  open  field  test.  We  also  present  preliminary  evidence  of  the  role  of  GLT-­1  in  modulating  extracellular  glutamate  levels,  intracellular  Ca2+  dynamics  in  astrocytes,  and  dopamine  release  from  dopaminergic  terminals.  Based  on  prior  work  and  these  preliminary  results,  we  hypothesize  that  astroglial  glutamate  signaling  in  the  striatum  is  impaired  in  Mecp2  deficient  mice  and  contributes  to  their  motor  deficits.  We  propose  two  Specific  Aims:  (1)  Identify  and  characterize  the  cellular  consequences  of  GLT-­1  dysfunction in cKO mice lacking Mecp2 in astrocytes, and (2) Characterize neuronal network activity and  striatum-­related  behaviors  in  cKO  mice  lacking Mecp2  in  astrocytes.  The  proposed  studies  will  elucidate  the consequences of MeCP2 loss in astrocyte GLT-­1 function on striatum-­dependent behaviors, which will have  broad implications not only for RTT but also for other brain disorders associated with striatal dysfunction.    PROJECT NARRATIVE  Rett  syndrome  (RTT),  caused  by  MECP2  mutations,  results  from  impaired  function  of  neurons  and  glial  cells  responsible for proper sensory integration and motor control. As a major glial cell type, astrocytes play a major  role  in  regulating  glutamate  homeostasis.  In  this  application,  we  will  define  the  role  of  MeCP2  in  astrocytes  of  the striatum by characterizing the cellular and behavioral consequences of its conditional cell-­specific deletion  on astroglial glutamate and dopamine signaling, the function of cortical inputs, and striatum-­related behaviors.   ",Impaired Astroglial Glutamate Signaling in Rett

"Neuron and Glial Cellular Signatures from Normal and Diseased iPS Cells DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a critical need to define the state and predict the behavior of human brain cells in health and disease. The number of different cell types in the CNS remains undefined, and despite a demographically ordained wave of neurodegenerative diseases, not a single disease-modifying therapy exists. Our  knowledge of the CNS and the foundation for intervening rationally in disease would be dramatically  advanced by generating quantitative molecular phenotypes essentially cell signatures of human neurons,  astrocytes and oligodendrocytes from healthy people and from patients with motor neuron disease,  Huntington's disease, and Parkinson's disease. The CNS is so unique that studying non-neuronal cells does not provide much assistance. Despite this desperate need, the inaccessibility of human brain cells meant studying them would have been impossible until the recent discovery of cellular reprogramming and induced pluripotent stem cell technology.  Here we propose to form the NeuroLINCS consortium to accomplish these goals. We have handpicked the team to bring in critical expertise in iPSC technology, disease modeling, transcriptomics, epigenomics, metabolomics, whole genome sequencing, proteomics, high content, high throughput longitudinal single cell analysis, other cell-based assays, bioinformatics, statistics and computational biology. In addition, we are collaborating with Google to bring in special expertise in machine learning and the integration of signatures across platforms into highly predictive models of responses to perturbagens. Together, we expect to develop cell signatures of an array of human brain cell types under different conditions that should be broadly applicable to the LINCs community. We also anticipate generating innovative software tools and approaches that will make the signature generating process cheaper, faster, and more reliable.  Besides the unique combination of expertise represented within NeuroLINCS, another distinguishing feature is the long track record that its members have of collaborating with each other. That collaborative spirit will be expressed in NeuroLINCS through its significant and multifaceted community outreach programs. These will involve specific and detailed plans to make the data and tools that NeuroLINCS generates available to the community, to interact with other LINCS sites, and to prepare for DCIC and the prospect of disseminating knowledge and resources at scale. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The cellular signatures of human neurons we identify can be used to provide insights into the molecular factors that distinguish central neurons from healthy people from those of patients with neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS, SMA, PD and HD. These insights will provide molecular targets that can be used to develop new drugs to block the progression of these diseases which are presently untreatable.",Neuron and Glial Cellular Signatures from Normal and Diseased iPS Cells,10095893,U54NS091046,"['Affect ', ' Astrocytes ', ' Astrocytus ', ' Astroglia ', ' astrocytic glia ', ' Behavior ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cell Differentiation process ', ' Cell Differentiation ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communities ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Foundations ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hereditary Disease ', ' Inborn Genetic Diseases ', ' Inherited disorder ', ' hereditary disorder ', ' heritable disorder ', ' inborn error ', ' inherited diseases ', ' inherited genetic disease ', ' inherited genetic disorder ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Huntington Disease ', ' Huntington Chorea ', "" Huntington's "", "" Huntington's Disease "", "" Huntington's Disease Pathway "", ' Huntingtons Disease ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Libraries ', ' Motor Neurons ', ' Motor Cell ', ' motoneuron ', ' Spinal Muscular Atrophy ', ' Aran-Duchenne disease ', ' Cruveilhier disease ', ' Persons ', ' Neuroglia ', ' Glia ', ' Glial Cells ', "" Kolliker's reticulum "", ' Neuroglial Cells ', ' Non-neuronal cell ', ' Nonneuronal cell ', ' nerve cement ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Oligodendroglia ', ' Oligodendrocytes ', ' Oligodendrocytus ', ' Oligodendroglia Cell ', ' Online Systems ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' online computer ', ' web based ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Parkinson ', "" Parkinson's disease "", ' Parkinsons disease ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Patients ', ' Physiology ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' statistics ', ' Technology ', ' Textbooks ', ' Time ', ' Motor Neuron Disease ', ' degenerative disorder of motor neurons ', ' Signal Transduction Pathway ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' Malignant Cell ', ' cancer cell ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' computer biology ', ' Computational Biology ', ' Knowledge ', ' cell biology ', ' Cellular biology ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' cell type ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Diseases ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural degenerative Disorders ', ' Neurodegenerative Diseases ', ' Neurologic Degenerative Conditions ', ' degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons ', ' degenerative neurological diseases ', ' neurodegenerative illness ', ' Neurodegenerative Disorders ', ' brain cell ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' receptor ', ' single cell analysis ', ' Scourge ', ' Structure ', ' member ', ' disorder model ', ' Disease model ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' outreach program ', ' response ', ' Proteomics ', ' CNS Nervous System ', ' Central Nervous System ', ' Neuraxis ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' genome sequencing ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' molecular profile ', ' molecular signature ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' Molecular Target ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' epigenomics ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Familial Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' transcriptomics ', ' Network-based ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' loss of function ', ' iPS ', ' iPSC ', ' iPSCs ', ' induced pluripotent stem cell ', ' disease-causing mutation ', ' stem cell technology ', ' public health relevance ', ' molecular phenotype ', ' Data Provenance ', ' entire genome ', ' full genome ', ' whole genome ', ' data tools ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,U54,2020,600000,CA-45,0.054984560782235244
"Impaired spatial decoding and neural population code rescaling in AD mice Impaired spatial decoding and neural population code rescaling in AD mice Project Summary: Considerable evidence exists to support the notion that amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau pathology impair neuronal circuit integrity and function in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Unfortunately, few studies have tested the direct influence of AD pathology on spatial computation within affected neuronal populations, resulting in an information gap at the neuronal network level. Moreover, in vivo experiments that examine large scale, neuronal network activity in mouse models of Aβ and tau pathology are lacking. In this proposal, I test the overarching hypothesis that Aβ and tau associated neuronal network dysfunction impairs task-relevant, spatial information encoding in large populations of neurons within the EC-HIPP circuit, and that combating this aberrant activity can restore order and improve spatial information processing in AD mice. In Aim 1, I will test the hypothesis that oligomeric forms of Aβ and tau disturb spatial information content encoded within large populations of neurons in the entorhinal cortex – hippocampal (EC-HIPP) circuit. I will also test if these oligomeric peptides alter the number of neurons recruited into the population code responsible for memory encoding in a spatial learning and memory task. In Aims 2 & 3, I will leverage the predictive power of machine learning to decipher the neural code for spatial information processing in EC-HIPP population activity. Specifically, my goals in Aim 2 will be to examine the individual and combined impact of Aβ and tau pathologies on features of spatial information encoding in the EC-Tau/hAPP mouse line. In Aim 3, I will employ chemogenetics using a novel DREADDs ligand to combat aberrant neuronal activity in AD mouse models, with the ultimate goal of improving spatial information processing in neuronal networks burdened with pathology. Excitatory neurons will be specifically targeted in an effort to better understand their contribution to impaired spatial information processing in AD mouse models.  The proposed research aims are designed to bridge an information gap between AD-related cognitive impairment and the underlying circuit pathology. This Mentored Research Scientist Development (K01) Award will afford me the opportunity to accomplish this major goal while enriching my technical skillset and expanding my knowledge of AD pathophysiology. In addition, the integrated training and mentorship that I will receive will help me develop additional expertise in machine learning for spatial decoding analyses. Together, the proposed studies and career development plan will ensure that I achieve my long-term career goal of launching a competitive, independent research career at a major research university. Project Narrative The progressive accumulation of amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau pathology in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is associated with dysfunctional neuronal signaling and poor cognitive performance. In this proposal, newly developed machine learning strategies will be used to decode features of task-relevant, spatial information from neural ensemble activity in the entorhinal cortex – hippocampal (EC-HIPP) circuit of transgenic mice expressing Aβ and tau pathology, with the overarching goal of understanding how Aβ and tau interfere with spatial information encoded within neuronal networks.

"Generating pro-resilient states through individualized circuit read-write therapeutics Project Summary  Major depressive disorder (MDD) and associated anxiety disorders are the most prevalent and costly mental illnesses in the United States, with health spending on treatment recently exceeding $71 billion per year. It is now well established that MDD represents a spectrum of disorders, but current drug based approaches to treatment are temporally nonselective, and their efficacy varies highly across individuals. In this proposal, we explore a ​novel individualized intervention strategy,​ wherein we aim to prevent and reverse MDD through closed-loop behavioral and neural circuit “tuning”.  While some individuals develop MDD as a result of a stressful life event, other individuals appear more resilient to stress-induced depression. Our goal in this proposal is to leverage recent advances in machine learning to identify and detect specific pro-resilient behaviors and patterns of activation in resilient individuals, and then use these data to “steer” susceptible individuals into pro-resilient states.  We will accomplish this in two phases. In the first phase, we will test whether modification of behavior alone can generate a pro-resilient state. We will take a novel quantitative approach to behavior analysis, using machine learning to identify specific micro behaviors that are unique to resilient individuals during a chronic social stress. Then, to test whether promoting these behaviors can provide depression-protective effects, we will then use a closed-loop strategy to detect ongoing behavior, and reinforce identified pro-resilient micro behaviors. Second, we will perform circuit-wide calcium recordings in the brain’s subcortical social behavior network and perform unsupervised detection of pro-resilience circuit motifs across the population. We will then use a novel closed-loop read-write strategy to optogentically “tune” the circuit dynamics to mimic these pro-resilient states. We will further explore how these interventions can be accomplished at various time points relative to a stressful life event (before, during, and after) to test whether circuit intervention can potentially provide protective or restorative treatment.  These data can potentially be used to develop novel behavior-based therapies for MDD, or to significantly refine the current use of deep-brain stimulation in order to generate pro-resilient states. Depression and associated anxiety disorders are the most prevalent and costly mental illnesses in the United States, and current drug-based approaches to treatment are expensive, temporally nonspecific, and often ineffective. Here, we propose to explore whether we can prevent and reverse outcomes associated with stress-induced depression through a novel individualized closed-loop intervention strategy. To do this, we will leverage recent advances in machine learning to longitudinally track the behaviors and underlying neural dynamics of “super resilient” individuals who are resistant to stress-induced depression and reinforce these behavior-based patterns in depressed individuals in order to promote pro-resilience states.",Generating pro-resilient states through individualized circuit read-write therapeutics,10002574,DP2MH126375,"['Anxiety Disorders ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Calcium ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Social Behavior ', ' sociobehavior ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Writing ', ' base ', ' Chronic ', ' Phase ', ' Individual ', ' Therapeutic ', ' depressed ', ' sadness ', ' Depressed mood ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Deep Brain Stimulation ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' reinforced behavior ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' novel ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' social stress ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' clinical depression ', ' major depression ', ' major depression disorder ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Behavioral ', ' restorative treatment ', ' cost ', ' resilient behavior ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' protective effect ', ' resistant ', ' Resistance ', ' ']",NIMH,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,DP2,2020,2430000,NJ-12,-0.13296286021822049
"The role of memory reactivation in emotional memory suppression and regulation Project Summary  Over the course of our lifetimes, we are bound to experience distressing, negative events we would rather not remember over and over again. Importantly, there is variability in people’s ability to cope with these memories. How do people regulate negative emotional memories, and why are some people better at dealing with negative memories than others? For my dissertation, I will investigate these questions through the lens of cognitive neuroscience, specifically looking at how memory reactivation strength can predict one’s ability to deal with negative memories. Prior work from the Norman Lab has postulated a U-shaped relationship between memory reactivation strength and the fate of a memory: Moderate reactivation leads to memory weakening while strong reactivation leads to strengthening. This proposal examines the impact of memory reactivation strength in 3 studies: In Study 1, I focus on memory suppression, a coping strategy where people try to stop an unwanted memory from coming to mind after it has been triggered by a cue in the environment. I will use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to relate the neural measure of memory reactivation during a memory suppression task to subsequent memory reactivation. In this study, for which data collection should be completed by the start of the F99 Phase, I will also examine the impact of inter-subject differences in depression level; prior research has shown that depressed participants appear to demonstrate a negative bias, which might be relevant to how strongly memories are reactivated. In Study 2, I will shift my focus to study cognitive reappraisal, an alternative strategy whereby participants reframe the interpretation of a negative event to mitigate the emotional intensity tied to its memory. Although this strategy requires bringing a memory to mind so that it can be reinterpreted, the impact of memory reactivation on cognitive reappraisal has not been well studied. I will use fMRI to investigate this gap in the literature, using data from a study for which data collection is already underway in the Ritchey Lab. Finally, in Study 3, I will use the eye tracker to study whether the application of temporally targeted visual stimuli can be used to modify subsequent memory performance by modulating memory reactivation strength. Prior research has demonstrated the relevance of using eye-tracking, which has finer temporal resolution and is more accessible than fMRI, to examine memory reactivation. Put together, this work will provide more insight into how memory reactivation strength influences the fate of negative memories, specifically after engaging in memory suppression and cognitive reappraisal. It will also elucidate ways in which memory reactivation can be leveraged and optimized in different coping strategies for dealing with unwanted, negative memories. The expertise of my sponsor, co- sponsor, and collaborator will be pivotal to my development as a researcher and the success of my dissertation work. In the K00 Phase, I will expand my knowledge of mental health disorders so that I can be equipped to become an independent researcher at the intersection of cognitive neuroscience and mental health disorders. Project Narrative  For my dissertation, I will investigate inter-subject and inter-trial differences in memory reactivation strength and how this variability affects memory suppression and cognitive reappraisal efficacy. This work will help to identify ways in which memory reactivation can be optimally leveraged to help people cope with negative, unwanted memories. Specifically, this work might provide ways to personalize interventions for patients with mental health disorders, such as depression, to increase the therapeutic impact.",The role of memory reactivation in emotional memory suppression and regulation,10155909,F99NS120647,"['Affect ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Cues ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Curriculum ', ' lesson plans ', ' Data Collection ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Environment ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Faculty ', ' Fellowship ', ' Goals ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Memory ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Societies ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Prize ', ' falls ', ' Phase ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' Distress ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Development Plans ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Therapeutic ', ' depressed ', ' sadness ', ' Depressed mood ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' posters ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' Postdoc ', ' Research Associate ', ' post-doc ', ' post-doctoral ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' visual stimulus ', ' eye tracking ', ' visual tracking ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Participant ', ' Emotional ', ' Regulation ', ' career development ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Data ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Scholars Program ', ' NCI Scholars Program ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' coping ', ' Mind ', ' cognitive neuroscience ', ' emotional stimulus ', ' lenses ', ' lens ', ' precision interventions ', ' personalized intervention ', ' cognitive regulation ', ' cognitive reappraisal ', ' temporal resolution ', ' time measurement ', ' temporal measurement ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' ']",NINDS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,F99,2020,46520,NJ-12,0.03349489857100565
"Developing Molecular and Computational Tools to Enable Visualization of Synaptic Plasticity In Vivo Project Summary Developing new methodological and analytical tools to address currently insurmountable experimental questions is crucial to the future of neuroscience. While recent advances in two-photon microscopy and activity sensors have revolutionized our understanding of the cellular and circuit basis of behavior, many barriers still exist that preclude fully exploring the molecular basis of these processes in vivo. This is an important question, as modulating synaptic strength is thought to underlie higher brain functions such as learning and memory, whereas synaptic degradation is observed in many neurological pathologies. Despite the clear significance of synaptic communication, a large-scale analysis of how synapses across the brain are distributed and change during learning has not been performed, mainly due to technical difficulties arising from the immensely complex nature of synaptic networks. Here, we present a suite of novel methodologies that breaks through these barriers. Our novel approach leverages CRISPR-based labeling of endogenous synaptic proteins, in vivo two-photon microscopy to visualize fluorescently tagged synapses in behaving animals, and deep-learning-based automatic synapse detection. Using these minimally invasive methods, we will be able to longitudinally track how the strength of millions of individual synapses change during learning. By developing and enabling new strategies to automatically detect and track vast numbers of synapses across entire brain regions, this pioneering approach has the potential to provide us with an unprecedented view of synapses in behaving animals, enabling new discoveries regarding how dynamic regulation of synaptic strength encodes learning and memory. Project Narrative This multi-disciplinary proposal leverages molecular labeling, machine learning, and in vivo microscopy to develop a suite of first-in-class tools to automatically detect synaptic plasticity in intact animals. By employing these novel tools we seek to explain how dynamic modulation of synaptic networks encodes learning and memory. Disruption of synaptic plasticity has been shown to be tightly associated with several neuropsychiatric diseases and the proposed research may reveal novel therapeutic approaches for several disorders including schizophrenia, autism, intellectual disability and Alzheimer's disease.",Developing Molecular and Computational Tools to Enable Visualization of Synaptic Plasticity In Vivo,10009886,RF1MH123212,"['Algorithms ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Animals ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cognition ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Learning ', ' Manuals ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Microscopy ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Synaptic Transmission ', ' Neural Transmission ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Proteins ', ' Reagent ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Silicon ', ' Si element ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Time ', ' Virus ', ' AMPA Receptors ', ' Mediating ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' homotypical cortex ', ' isocortex ', ' neopallium ', ' Neocortex ', ' base ', ' density ', ' Label ', ' sensor ', ' Cranial ', ' Cephalic ', ' Area ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Genetic ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' cell type ', ' Techniques ', ' Intellectual disability ', ' Intellectual limitation ', ' intellectual and developmental disability ', ' Intellectual functioning disability ', ' Viral ', ' interest ', ' calcium indicator ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Speed ', ' novel ', ' Regulation ', ' brain volume ', ' Molecular Computations ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Detection ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' computational analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computer analyses ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' Excitatory Synapse ', ' KI mice ', ' knockin mice ', ' Knock-in Mouse ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Behavioral Paradigm ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' Synaptic plasticity ', ' analytical tool ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' open source ', ' synapse function ', ' synaptic function ', ' neurological pathology ', ' postsynaptic ', ' new therapeutic approach ', ' new therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic strategies ', ' new therapy approaches ', ' novel therapeutic approach ', ' novel therapy approach ', ' novel therapeutic intervention ', ' minimally invasive ', ' CRISPR ', ' CRISPR/Cas system ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats ', ' CRISPR method ', ' CRISPR methodology ', ' CRISPR technique ', ' CRISPR technology ', ' CRISPR-CAS-9 ', ' CRISPR-based method ', ' CRISPR-based technique ', ' CRISPR-based technology ', ' CRISPR-based tool ', ' CRISPR/Cas method ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 technology ', ' Cas nuclease technology ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats method ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats methodology ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats technique ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats technology ', ' CRISPR/Cas technology ', ' knockin ', ' Knock-in ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' in vivo two-photon imaging ', ' deep learning ', ' 2-photon microscopy ', ' two photon excitation microscopy ', ' two photon microscopy ', ' Visualization ', ' automatic algorithm ', ' automated algorithm ', ' ']",NIMH,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,RF1,2020,1757079,MD-07,-0.00721545984728333
"Deciphering the building blocks of hippocampal circuits   Abstract   Since  Ramon  y  Cajal,  neuroscientists  have  speculated  that  even  the  most  complex  brain  functions  might  eventually be understood at the level of neuronal cell types and their connections. Unfortunately, our under‐ standing of the brain's extensive diversity of cell types and elaborate circuitry remains far from complete. For  example, despite the hippocampus being essential for learning and memory and its dysfunction underlying a  wide variety of devastating neuropsychiatric disorders, we still lack fundamental knowledge about its constit‐ uent cell types and their molecular profiles and connectivity, slowing progress towards a mechanistic circuit‐ level understanding of memory formation. We propose to identify all of the interneuron cell types in area CA1  of the hippocampus and decipher their canonical connectivity. We have assembled a strong interdisciplinary  team  capable  of  combining  cutting‐edge  technologies  including  high‐throughput  multi‐cell  patch  recordings,  morphological reconstructions, single‐cell RNA sequencing, and machine learning to achieve two main goals:  1) dissect CA1 microcircuit organization by generating a morphological and electrophysiological taxonomy of  all interneuron cell types in mouse CA1 and map their connections; and 2) derive transcriptomic signatures of  morphologically defined CA1 interneurons using our newly developed Patch‐seq method. Our team recently  implemented  this  interdisciplinary  experimental  strategy  to  successfully  identify  cell  types  in  the  neocortex  and dissect their microcircuitry. Using multi‐cell patch clamp recording, we will characterize the electrophysi‐ ological properties, morphology, laminar location and connectivity of thousands of neurons from mouse CA1  hippocampus. We will also utilize a new, highly sensitive, cost effective technique for single‐cell RNA sequenc‐ ing (Smart‐seq2) to map their transcriptomes and machine learning techniques to classify cells into molecular  types.  Importantly,  our  high‐throughput  method  will  allow  us  to  obtain  morphological,  electrophysiological  and  complete  transcriptome  information  for  single  neurons,  which  cannot  be  achieved  using  other  methods  such as dissociating tissue for single‐cell sequencing. In‐house customization and automation has reduced our  sequencing costs, enabling us to sequence thousands of cells within a reasonable budget. Cell type identifica‐ tion will be validated using morphological, electrophysiological, and molecular tests. Identifying all of the in‐ terneuron  cell  types  that  comprise  CA1  and  determining  how  they  connect  to  each  other  will  have  a  broad,  paradigm‐shifting impact. For instance, it will contribute to a circuit‐level understanding of the computations  that take place in CA1, such as memory formation. From a clinical perspective, single‐cell transcriptome data  will yield a powerful atlas to investigate relationships between cell types and genes related to neuropsychiatric  diseases and facilitate cell‐type engineering.       Narrative  The  hippocampus  is  a  complex  brain  structure  that  mediates  remarkable  mental  functions  like  learning  and  memory, while its malfunction is associated with devastating neuropsychiatric diseases including Alzheimer's

"Towards elucidation of circuit mechanisms for feeding-related manual dexterity PROJECT SUMMARY Dexterous food-handling is a critical but still poorly understood type of basic motor behavior. We propose an exploratory research program to investigate how the mouse uses its digits and forepaws to dexterously handle food. Preliminary results suggest that mouse food-handling movements, despite appearing extremely complex, can be decomposed into several types of simpler elements, tentatively identified as distinct and very rapid submovements that exhibit partly stereotyped and partly variable kinematic features. They also suggest that the mouse’s thumb (first digit, or D1; pollex) plays a surprisingly large and previously unrecognized role in dexterous food-handling. To explore these hypotheses and observations, we will first develop an approach for quantitatively characterizing seed-handling behaviors of freely moving mice. For this we will use high-speed, close-up video capture, combined with deep neural network methods for automated markerless tracking (DeepLabCut). We will then develop a novel trial-based paradigm for characterizing seed-handling under the more experimentally controlled conditions of head-fixation. We will combine this approach with tools for optogenetic silencing of either selectively targeted cortical areas or selectively labeled corticospinal neurons in motor cortex, as well as multi- probe/multi-channel linear array recordings of spiking activity in key nodes along sensorimotor pathways. Collectively this work will advance our understanding of the elemental movements involved in the dexterous manipulation of food, providing new insights into this process in a genetically tractable model organism, and opening the way for future studies to dissect the cellular mechanisms in sensorimotor circuits mediating specific aspects of forelimb and digit motor control. NARRATIVE The proposed research on dexterous forelimb behavior is directly relevant to public health because pathology in the neural circuits that mediate these behaviors severely impairs motor control. By elucidating fundamental aspects of these behaviors in a model mammalian organism, the mouse, this research can lead to new treatments of disease, and is thus relevant to those aspects of the NIH mission aimed at improving health through understanding pathophysiological mechanisms in disorders causing disability.",Towards elucidation of circuit mechanisms for feeding-related manual dexterity,9982480,R21NS116886,"['Activities of Daily Living ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' daily living functionality ', ' functional ability ', ' functional capacity ', ' Behavior ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Deglutition ', ' Swallowing ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Elements ', ' Exhibits ', ' Fingers ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food Analysis ', ' Food Analyses ', ' Food Handling ', ' Forelimb ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Hand ', ' Head ', ' Health ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Manuals ', ' Mastication ', ' Chewing ', ' chewed ', ' chews ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Motion ', ' Motor Cortex ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Pathology ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Seeds ', ' Plant Embryos ', ' Plant Zygotes ', ' seed ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Stereotyping ', ' Thumb structure ', ' Thumb ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Mediating ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Grips ', ' grasp ', ' Buccal Cavity ', ' Buccal Cavity Head and Neck ', ' Cavitas Oris ', ' Mouth ', ' Oral cavity ', ' disability ', ' insight ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Sensory ', ' cell type ', ' Viral ', ' Digit ', ' Digit structure ', ' Sensorimotor functions ', ' free behavior ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' kinematic model ', ' kinematics ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Modeling ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Resolution ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' Fixation ', ' sample fixation ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' feeding ', ' Outcome ', ' Movement science ', ' Kinesiology ', ' Impairment ', ' movement impairment ', ' movement limitation ', ' motor impairment ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' motor control ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' optogenetics ', ' dexterity ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep neural network ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' motor behavior ', ' ']",NINDS,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R21,2020,434500,IL-07,-0.08219661672775924
"The Nanoscale Connectome of the Cochlear Nucleus The cochlear nucleus is the gateway for central nervous system processing of auditory information in mammals. It has been proposed that parallel processing channels are set up in the CN, and these form the basis for further computation at higher stations of the auditory system. Despite decades of study, enumeration of CN cell types is incomplete and CN circuitry is described only superficially. In neuroscience generally, classification and naming of neurons has relied primarily upon qualitative approaches based upon human observational capabilities. We have implemented and in some cases developed novel high-throughput and unbiased techniques for labeling, segmenting and classifying neurons in 3D, generated from large-scale electron microscopy image volumes. We propose to deliver a nanoscale map, or connectome, of the mouse CN with enumerated and localized cell types and their synaptic connections. This effort is unbiased because all neurons will be sampled. To achieve this goal, we bring together four parallel modes of tissue analysis for neuron classification: morphology, connectivity, molecular identity and function. We propose that connectivity analysis will define long-proposed parallel processing circuits that will be tested functionally using realistic biophysical models of identified cell types. Notably, the cochlear nucleus contains both amorphous and layered organizations of cells, which serve as templates for all other brain regions. By investigating the fundamental structure of this sensory center, we will establish principles of neural computation and methods for structural and functional phenotyping that will apply to other brain regions regardless of their particular neural architecture. Relevance to Public Health The goal of this project is to deliver to the auditory research community the connectome of the mouse cochlear nucleus. In the process we will refine and develop comprehensive and high throughput methods to catalogue cell types and their connections in any brain region, and will provide molecular phenotypes for cochlear nucleus cell types that may be useful in their targeted manipulation for research and therapeutic purposes. This work forms a basis to study central alterations following noise- induced hearing loss or other cochlear pathology, and gain deeper understanding of all auditory structures from brainstem to cortex.",The Nanoscale Connectome of the Cochlear Nucleus,9898347,R01DC015901,"['Acoustic Nerve ', ' Cranial Nerve Eight ', ' Cranial Nerve VIII ', ' Eighth Cranial Nerve ', ' VIIIth Cranial Nerve ', ' Vestibulocochlear Nerve ', ' auditory nerve ', ' Acoustics ', ' Acoustic ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Axon ', ' Biophysics ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' Birds ', ' Aves ', ' Avian ', ' Brain Stem ', ' Brainstem ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Censuses ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Cochlea ', ' Cochlear Organ ', ' Communities ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Goals ', ' Hearing ', ' Noise-Induced Hearing Loss ', ' noise related hearing loss ', ' noise-induced hearing impairment ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' nerve supply ', ' innervation ', ' Learning ', ' Mammals ', ' Mammalia ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Electron Microscopy ', ' Scanning Electron Microscopy ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Names ', ' Nerve ', ' Nerve Fibers ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Octopus ', ' Pathology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' sound ', ' Standardization ', ' Supervision ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Work ', ' recombinase ', ' Cochlear nucleus ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' Peripheral ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Link ', ' Cell Components ', ' Cell Structure ', ' Cellular Structures ', ' Hearing Disorders ', ' auditory disease ', ' auditory disorder ', ' auditory problem ', ' hearing disease ', ' Hearing problem ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' Morphology ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Catalogs ', ' programs ', ' Frequencies ', ' Auditory ', ' Sensory ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Location ', ' sensory nerve ', ' afferent nerve ', ' Auditory system ', ' granule cell ', ' parallel processing ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' central nervous system processing ', ' CNS processing ', ' cellular targeting ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Graph ', ' sensory system ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Skeleton ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' virtual reality ', ' Brain region ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' molecular profile ', ' molecular signature ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' Resolution ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' molecular scale ', ' nano meter scale ', ' nano meter sized ', ' nano scale ', ' nanometer scale ', ' nanometer sized ', ' nanoscale ', ' neural model ', ' Cellular model ', ' Cell model ', ' fluorescent imaging ', ' fluorescence imaging ', ' molecular phenotype ', ' biophysical model ', ' microscope imaging ', ' microscopy imaging ', ' microscopic imaging ', ' connectome ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' auditory processing ', ' human error ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' health goals ', ' in silico ', ' auto-segmentation ', ' automatic segmentation ', ' autosegmentation ', ' automated segmentation ', ' ']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH FLORIDA,R01,2020,620597,FL-14,0.04337167384957768
"Striatal pathophysiology in dystonia Dystonia is characterized by involuntary muscle contractions that cause twisting movements and postures. Although basal ganglia dysfunction is consistently implicated across many forms of dystonia, the underlying pathophysiology is unknown. The major input structure of the basal ganglia is the striatum. The vast majority of neurons in the striatum are GABAergic spiny projection neurons (SPNs). Direct pathway SPNs (dSPNs) project to the internal pallidum (GPi) to promote movement. Indirect pathway SPNs (iSPNs) project to the external pallidum (GPe) to inhibit movement. Although dSPNs and dSPNs are largely segregated into separate pathways, they act in concert and within ensembles of coactivity to select and refine movements. In dystonia patients, this coordinated activity appears to be disrupted as microelectrode recordings in dystonia patients reveal abnormal activity in both GPi and GPe. Although these results implicate abnormal activity in both dSPNs and iSPNs, the abnormal patterns of striatal activity that mediate dystonia are unknown. Several challenges have stymied our ability to understand the abnormal neural code underlying dystonia. First, the information obtained from microelectrode recording in patients is, by necessity, quite limited. Second, because dystonia is induced by movement, recordings must be made in awake unrestrained subjects to obtain authentic results. Third, to meaningfully understand striatal pathophysiology, it is necessary to distinguish between dSPNs and iSPNs, which is challenging to accomplish using microelectrode recordings in vivo because these two distinct cells types are intermingled within the striatum. With the recent development of lightweight miniature fluorescence microscopes that can be used to image the activity of genetically-identified SPNs in freely moving mice, we can overcome these obstacles to understand the physiological substrates of dystonia. For the first experiments to reveal abnormal patterns of striatal activity in dystonia, we will use a knockin mouse model of DOPA-responsive dystonia (DRD) in which the striatum is known to play a central role in mediating the dystonia. In fact, both dSPN and iSPN signaling is disrupted in these mice. Thus, we now have an unprecedented opportunity to elucidate the neural code of dystonia for the first time. The Specific Aim is to identify abnormal patterns of striatal activity in dystonia. We will test the hypothesis that dystonia is mediated by abnormal neuronal activity and degraded ensemble activity of dSPNs and iSPNs by performing in vivo Ca2+ imaging in freely moving normal or DRD mice that selectively express the GCaMP6f calcium indicator in either dSPNs or iSPNs. Abnormal firing patterns including the degree of spatial clustering of coactive neurons will be assessed using both well-established approaches and a novel analysis of population dynamics using a machine learning algorithm that we recently developed to identify and predict dystonia-specific neuronal ensemble firing patterns. Although dystonia is the third most common movement disorder after tremor and Parkinson’s disease, treatments for dystonia are inadequate because the underlying neuronal dysfunction is not well understood. Understanding abnormal patterns of striatal activity in dystonia will provide a novel platform for the development of therapeutics that target the abnormal neural code, rather than the traditional one-drug-one-target approach.!",Striatal pathophysiology in dystonia,9957592,R21NS116311,"['Basal Ganglia ', ' Basal Nuclei ', ' Behavior ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Striatum ', ' striatal ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Dopamine ', ' Hydroxytyramine ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Dystonia ', ' Muscle Dystonia ', ' Genes ', ' Globus Pallidus ', ' pallidum ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Methods ', ' Microelectrodes ', ' Miniaturized Electrodes ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Movement Disorders ', ' Dyskinesia Syndromes ', ' Movement Disorder Syndromes ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Muscle Contraction ', ' Muscle Cell Contraction ', ' Muscular Contraction ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Parkinson ', "" Parkinson's disease "", ' Parkinsons disease ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Legal patent ', ' Patents ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Population Dynamics ', ' Posture ', ' Dopamine Receptor ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tremor ', ' Dopamine D1 Receptor ', ' D1 receptor ', ' Dopamine D2 Receptor ', ' D2 receptor ', ' DRD2 Receptor ', ' Factor Analyses ', ' Factor Analysis ', ' Mediating ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' awake ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Functional disorder ', ' lightweight ', ' light weight ', ' Knowledge ', ' abnormal involuntary movement ', ' Involuntary Movements ', ' Severities ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' calcium indicator ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' UV laboratory microscope ', ' Ultraviolet Microscopes ', ' fluorescence/UV microscope ', ' fluorescent microscope ', ' laboratory fluorescence light microscope ', ' fluorescence microscope ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Involuntary Muscle ', ' Smooth Muscle ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Population Analysis ', ' in vivo ', ' KI mice ', ' knockin mice ', ' Knock-in Mouse ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Autosomal Dominant Segawa Syndrome ', ' Dystonia 5 ', ' Dystonia-parkinsonism with diurnal fluctuation ', ' Dopa-Responsive Dystonia ', ' neural dysfunction ', ' Neuronal Dysfunction ', ' murine model ', ' mouse model ', ' therapeutic target ', ' selectively expressed ', ' selective expression ', ' prototype ', ' therapeutic agent development ', ' therapeutic development ', ' dynamical system ', ' dynamic system ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' recurrent neural network ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NINDS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,427605,GA-05,0.004389298987163816
"Revealing the transcriptomic basis of neuronal identity through functional meta-analysis PROJECT SUMMARY Our overarching goal is to understand how the relationships between genes contribute to functional properties in neurons and how those functions combine to define types of neurons. This is a central question of basic neuroscience, and one which is newly assessable using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). These data provide high-throughput snapshots of gene activities across thousands of cells and thus shed new light on the relationships between genes within and across cells. We propose to exploit this data in conjunction with previously known details about gene function and neuronal identity to learn new features of both. Our research approach is meta-analytic, using data from many different laboratories to obtain a more robust aggregate signal. In addition to developing meta-analytic methods to pursue our direct research interests, the methods are of broad practical relevance to neuroscience laboratories studying many different questions, including diseases of the nervous system. Disseminating our software deliverables in a convenient-to-use form is a central component of each of our research objectives. The three complementary objectives in this project are to: 1. Learn patterns of gene expression which characterize known cell identity. Building on our previous research showing conserved expression patterns across cell-types, we will define shared gene expression patterns, called co-expression, specific to neuronal sub-populations. These shared expression patterns will be used as an assay into cellular identity. 2.Identify novel cell subtypes through changes in the expression relationships between genes. Variation in co-expression is a form of transcriptional rewiring which often indicates a change in function. To find novel neuronal sub-types we will assess the data for changes in co-expression reflecting a change in functions linked to neuronal identity. We will identify novel transcriptional signatures which replicate across laboratories. 3. Determine consensus methods for customized cell-type learning. Defining wholly unknown expression profiles is likely to benefit from a variety of approaches. In order to find agreement between those approaches, we will develop an algorithm to efficiently search through gene sets likely to find those with complementary value. These gene sets will then be assessed across many pre-existing methods, with customized combinations and aggregate output reported and made available through a public web-server. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent advances in genetics have it made possible to assess gene activity at a cellular level. The primary goal of this project is to develop and validate methods and data resources which combine data from many laboratories to identify how genes interact to produce different functional effects in different types of neurons. Because most gene functions are accomplished in concert with other genes, knowing how genes change their interactions provides key information into how their function might be disrupted in disease.",Revealing the transcriptomic basis of neuronal identity through functional meta-analysis,9938688,R01MH113005,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communities ', ' Crowding ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Joints ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' Libraries ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Methods ', ' Nervous system structure ', ' Nervous System ', ' Neurologic Body System ', ' Neurologic Organ System ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Noise ', ' Phenotype ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Work ', ' Custom ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Genetic ', ' gene function ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Consensus ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' exhaustion ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' Ablation ', ' functional group ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Agreement ', ' Laboratory Study ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Property ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Transcript ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' groupings ', ' Grouping ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Output ', ' Expression Signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' gene expression signature ', ' transcriptional signature ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' transcriptomics ', ' candidate biomarker ', ' candidate marker ', ' screening ', ' Data Discovery ', ' data resource ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' in situ sequencing ', ' scRNA-seq ', ' single cell RNA-seq ', ' single cell RNAseq ', ' single-cell RNA sequencing ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' web server ', ' learning algorithm ', ' ']",NIMH,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,R01,2020,480000,NY-03,0.057852380733352006
"Uncovering the molecular identity of retinal cell types, and their responses to nerve injury using single-cell transcriptomics ABSTRACT Neurons of the central nervous system (CNS) have been historically categorized into discrete ""types"" based on structure, physiological responses, connectivity patterns, and molecular profiles. Heterogeneity can have other consequences- e.g. recent studies have found that some neuronal types in the retina are more resilient than other types to optic nerve injury, an event that leads to irrecoverable damage in vision. My project combines cutting-edge single-cell genomic technologies, advanced computational data analysis and molecular tools to define heterogeneity of neuronal types comprehensively, to connect molecular definitions to histology, and explore the functional consequences of this heterogeneity during nerve injury. I will focus on a tractable system, the mouse retina, which communicates visual responses to the brain. It is as complex as any other region of the brain (containing ~120 neuronal types), but benefits from having a compact, accessible structure, and experimental tools make it especially suited for detailed analyses. Building on my previous postdoctoral work, this project will, 1) Complete the census of the mouse retina, which will the first for any CNS region, by inferring molecular taxonomies of two of its most heterogenous classes (amacrines and ganglion cells) from data collected using high-throughput single-cell RNA-sequencing. Using the mouse census, initiate a similar mapping of the macaque retina, which is harder to access experimentally, but shares important features with humans that are absent in mice. 2) Conduct a systematic investigation of cell-type specific responses in the retina to optic nerve injury. This usually leads to a rapid, stereotypic death of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), but a recent study by my colleagues reported that some RGC types are more resilient than others. Here, using 1) as a resource, I will identify factors, cell intrinsic and extrinsic, that make these RGC types resilient. 3) Selective resilience of cell types is now recognized as a feature of diseases like glaucoma and stroke. Therapies therefore need to cater to different cell types. To learn more, and derive general principles, I will examine the impact of known therapeutic interventions on the survival of different RGC types, and the underlying molecular responses, within the optic nerve injury model. Taken together, my project will derive substantial molecular information underlying neuronal heterogeneity in the mouse and macaque retina and general principles for cell-type selective resilience following CNS injury in mice. The lessons from this work will provide valuable guidance for similar studies in less accessible regions of the brain (e.g. cerebral cortex).   NARRATIVE The central nervous system (CNS) is made up of a large diversity of neuronal types, a major proportion of which remain to be identified and defined in terms of molecular markers so that their roles in function and dysfunction can be assessed. This project seeks to combine high-throughput single-cell transcriptomics, innovative computational and histological methods to comprehensively define neuronal heterogeneity in an accessible system – the mouse retina, and use this as a foundation to (1) initiate a similar mapping of the macaque retina, and (2) study cell-type specific responses in a tractable model of nerve injury (optic nerve crush) to map the resilience of different cell types, and identify molecular correlates underlying these differences. Our work will create transformational tools to address similar challenges in other CNS regions.","Uncovering the molecular identity of retinal cell types, and their responses to nerve injury using single-cell transcriptomics",10087165,R00EY028625,"['Axon ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Felis catus ', ' Cats ', ' Cats Mammals ', ' Domestic Cats ', ' Feline Species ', ' Felis domestica ', ' Felis domesticus ', ' Felis sylvestris catus ', ' Cell Communication ', ' Cell Interaction ', ' Cell-to-Cell Interaction ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Censuses ', ' Cerebral cortex ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Foundations ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Glaucoma ', ' glaucomatous ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Histology ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Inflammation ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Learning ', ' Macaca ', ' Macaque ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Nerve Crush ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Optic Nerve ', ' Cranial Nerve II ', ' Second Cranial Nerve ', ' Physiology ', ' Natural regeneration ', ' Regeneration ', ' regenerate ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Retina ', ' Retinal Ganglion Cells ', ' retinal ganglion ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Technology ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Vertebrates ', ' Vertebrate Animals ', ' vertebrata ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Work ', ' Molecular Genetics ', ' Mediating ', ' General Taxonomy ', ' Taxonomy ', ' Cranial Nerve II Injuries ', ' Optic Nerve Trauma ', ' Second Cranial Nerve Injuries ', ' Second Cranial Nerve Trauma ', ' Traumatic Optic Neuropathy ', ' Optic Nerve Injuries ', ' neural injury ', ' nerve injury ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' Histologically ', ' Histologic ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' gangliocyte ', ' ganglion cell ', ' Amacrine Cells ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' Morphology ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' neuroprotection ', ' functional recovery ', ' Recovery of Function ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' Reporting ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Genomics ', ' CNS Nervous System ', ' Central Nervous System ', ' Neuraxis ', ' CNS Injury ', ' injured CNS ', ' central nervous system injury ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' molecular profile ', ' molecular signature ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' in vivo ', ' computational analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computer analyses ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' Molecular ', ' Behavioral ', ' injured ', ' knockdown ', ' knock-down ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' resilience ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' transcriptomics ', ' retinal neuron ', ' new marker ', ' novel biomarker ', ' novel marker ', ' molecular biomarker ', ' molecular marker ', ' Immune infiltrates ', ' T cell infiltration ', ' T cell tumor trafficking ', ' immune cell infiltrate ', ' immune infiltration ', ' intratumoral immune cell ', ' tumor immune cell ', ' Tumor-infiltrating immune cells ', ' model of human ', ' human model ', ' scRNA-seq ', ' single cell RNA-seq ', ' single cell RNAseq ', ' single-cell RNA sequencing ', ' stroke-like event ', ' stroke-like injury ', ' stroke-like insult ', ' stroke-like ischemic event ', ' stroke-like episode ', ' retinal ganglion cell regeneration ', ' recovery after injury ', ' recovery following injury ', ' recovery post injury ', ' injury recovery ', ' ']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R00,2020,249000,CA-13,0.03336157137193597
"The Role of Neuronal Ensembles Supporting Auditory Fear Conditioning (Engrams) in the Amygdala in Memory Formation, Generalization and Extinction Project Summary/Abstract Memory may be defined as the retention over time of internal representations gained through experience, and the capacity to reconstruct these representations at later times (Dudai 2007). These internal representations are thought to be encoded by long-lasting physical brain changes (memory traces or `engrams') (Josselyn, Kohler & Frankland 2015, 2017; Tonegawa et al. 2015; Schacter 2001). Remembering fear-evoking events is adaptive; it helps one make future choices based on past experience. It may even be beneficial to generalize some fearful memories. However, excessive fear generalization or treating no-longer threatening stimuli as dangerous may be maladaptive. Indeed, recurrent or inappropriately expressed fearful memories are a major component of several psychiatric diseases, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety. Therefore, understanding how memory traces for fearful events are formed, change over time, under what conditions they remain specific or generalize, and how they are impacted by behavioral extinction are critical questions to not only understanding how the brain uses information but also for informing the development of new treatment/prevention strategies for disorders characterized by inappropriate fear memories. Here two PIs (Drs. Josselyn and Frankland), both New Investigators, will combine their expertise to address these important questions. Because all techniques are associated with caveats and limitations, we will use a variety of techniques including optogenetic manipulation, brain-wide neuronal activity mapping and the use of graph-theory to produce “engram maps” and real time in vivo calcium imaging combined with behavior. Together, the ability to manipulate and observe an engram as it forms, changes over time and with behavioral extinction is innovative and may lead to a shift in the very definition of an engram, as well as increase our understanding for developing treatments aimed at resolving inappropriate fear memories. Project Narrative More effective treatment approaches for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or other anxiety disorders will be facilitated by better understanding how the brain forms memory traces supporting fear memories, how these change over time and with extinction.","The Role of Neuronal Ensembles Supporting Auditory Fear Conditioning (Engrams) in the Amygdala in Memory Formation, Generalization and Extinction",9891099,R01MH119421,"['Amygdaloid structure ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Anxiety ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Calcium ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Dangerousness ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Endoscopes ', ' Extinction (Psychology) ', ' Extinction ', ' behavioral extinction ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Freezing ', ' Future ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Maps ', ' Memory ', ' Microscopy ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' PTSD ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' post-trauma stress disorder ', ' posttrauma stress disorder ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Training Activity ', ' training module ', ' Virus ', ' Halorhodopsins ', ' Halorhodopsin Chromoprotein ', ' Opsin ', ' Rod-Opsin ', ' Mediating ', ' promotor ', ' promoter ', ' FISH Technic ', ' FISH Technique ', ' FISH analysis ', ' FISH assay ', ' Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization ', ' Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization ', ' base ', ' Lateral ', ' Immediate-Early Genes ', ' Training ', ' Stimulus ', ' Auditory ', ' Event ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Nuclear ', ' experience ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Address ', ' fear conditioning ', ' conditioned fear ', ' Data ', ' Retrieval ', ' wildtype mouse ', ' Wild Type Mouse ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' neuronal excitability ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment strategy ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' optogenetics ', ' fear memory ', ' memory consolidation ', ' graph theory ', ' In vivo two-photon calcium imaging ', ' in vivo calcium imaging ', ' recruit ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' data processing pipeline ', ' data analysis pipeline ', ' ']",NIMH,HOSPITAL FOR SICK CHLDRN (TORONTO),R01,2020,355558,,0.055783606203512644
"Exocytosis fuels plasma membrane expansion in developing neurons Project Summary During development, neurons acquire a polarized, elongated, and complex morphology, which requires a significant expansion of plasma membrane surface area. Surface increases have been estimated to reach upward of 20% per day, which far exceeds concomitant neuronal volume increases. We previously demonstrated that SNARE-mediated exocytosis is required during neuritogenesis and axon branching, presumably to provide membrane material to the expanding plasma membrane, which can only stretch ~2-3% prior to rupture. Asymmetric exocytosis has also been implicated in the attractive axonal turning responses that are critical for axon guidance. Achieving proper neuronal morphogenesis and connectivity is central to the formation of a functional nervous system. Together these factors underscore the significance of regulated exocytosis in developing neurons, even prior to synaptogenesis. Over the last 40 years, a multitude of components involved in exocytosis have been identified, although this list is not exhaustive. Further, mechanisms that regulate the mode, progression, frequency, or spatiotemporal organization of vesicle fusion with the membrane, all of which are poised to modulate neuronal morphogenesis, have not been defined. To visualize exocytic events in developing neurons, we express a pH-sensitive variant of GFP (pHluorin) attached to the lumenal side of a v-SNARE, such as VAMP2 or VAMP7, to illuminate the occurrence of fusion pore opening between the acidic vesicular lumen and the neutral extracellular space. Analysis of such images has remained a time-intensive, non-automated bottleneck, delaying understanding of this fundamental cellular behavior. We developed a fully-automated computer- vision software for the detection and analysis of VAMP-pHluorin mediated exocytic events that will quantitatively reveal the spatial and temporal organization and regulation of exocytosis in developing neurons at a level of detail previously unattainable. We exploit this innovative methodology along with unbiased proteomics, microfluidics, biochemical and cell biological approaches to investigate the relationship between exocytosis and neuronal morphogenesis and identifying the molecular mechanisms that regulate exocytosis in developing neurons. PROJECT NARRATIVE During development, neurons acquire a highly elongated, polarized and complex cell shape that requires a dramatic expansion of the neuronal surface area or plasma membrane, which is hypothesized to be fueled by vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane. We will define mechanisms that regulate the mode, progression, frequency, and organization of vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane of developing neurons, all of which are poised to modulate neuronal cell shape.",Exocytosis fuels plasma membrane expansion in developing neurons,9984554,R01NS112326,"['Affect ', ' Axon ', ' Cell membrane ', ' Cytoplasmic Membrane ', ' Plasma Membrane ', ' plasmalemma ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Clathrin ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Diffusion ', ' Endocytosis ', ' Exocytosis ', ' Extracellular Space ', ' Intercellular Space ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' In Vitro ', ' Methodology ', ' Morphogenesis ', ' morphogenetic process ', ' Nervous system structure ', ' Nervous System ', ' Neurologic Body System ', ' Neurologic Organ System ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Phosphorylation ', ' Protein Phosphorylation ', ' Protein Tyrosine Kinase ', ' EPH- and ELK-Related Tyrosine Kinase ', ' EPH-and ELK-Related Kinase ', ' Ephrin Type-A Receptor 8 ', ' Ephrin Type-A Receptor 8 Precursor ', ' Protein Tyrosine Kinase EEK ', ' Tyrosine Kinase ', ' Tyrosine-Protein Kinase Receptor EEK ', ' Tyrosine-Specific Protein Kinase ', ' Tyrosylprotein Kinase ', ' hydroxyaryl protein kinase ', ' tyrosyl protein kinase ', ' Proteins ', ' Publishing ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Tetanus ', ' clostridial tetanus ', ' Time ', ' Neurites ', ' Mediating ', ' Cell Shape ', ' Lateral ', ' Distal ', ' Area ', ' Surface ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Biochemical ', ' NSF attachment protein receptor ', ' SNARE ', ' soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive-factor attachment protein receptor ', ' SNAP receptor ', ' Morphology ', ' Vesicle ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Side ', ' Techniques ', ' Growth Cones ', ' membrane structure ', ' Membrane ', ' synapse formation ', ' synaptogenesis ', ' physical model ', ' Stretching ', ' novel ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Proteomics ', ' PHluorin ', ' axon growth cone guidance ', ' axon guidance ', ' Regulation of Exocytosis ', ' µfluidic ', ' Microfluidics ', ' FADK ', ' FAK ', ' FAK1 ', ' PTK2 ', ' pp125FAK ', ' PTK2 gene ', ' v-SNAREs ', ' vesicule SNARE proteins ', ' vesicular SNARE proteins ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' in vivo ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' TIRF Microscopy ', ' Total Internal Reflection Fluorescent Microscopy ', ' Total Internal Reflection Fluorescent ', ' Rupture ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' resistant ', ' Resistance ', ' cellular behavior ', ' cell behavior ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2020,384007,NC-04,0.06710044585316371
"Systems-level and in situ transcriptomics deconstruction of neural circuits underlying sensorimotor transformation in an innate behavior Project Summary/Abstract In order to control specific behavioral responses, transcriptionally distinct cell types assembled into dynamic brain circuits integrate environmental information with internal states and generate purposeful motor actions. While tools have been developed to independently measure the activity dynamics, connectivity and transcriptional profiles of individual neurons, it remains challenging to integrate this diverse information into a coherent model of behavior. To address this challenge, we aim to uncover the sensorimotor transformations leading to a complex naturalistic behavior, male and female parenting, by developing innovative molecular, imaging and systems-level approaches and by integrating multimodal information obtained from single neurons in behaving animals. In aim 1, we will develop new tools to uncover the activity and the transcriptional identity of neuronal cell types involved in infant-mediated behavior. In aim 2, we will explore in molecular, functional, and behavioral terms how olfactory and other sensory modalities underlie parenting behavior in males and females and in virgin versus mated states. In aim 3, we will investigate how specific hypothalamic cell types process information reflecting behavioral outcomes using a combination of spatial transcriptomic, functional imaging, circuit tracing and behavioral methods. In aim 4, we will combine cell-type based neuronal architecture with activity patterns across key brain regions to formulate predictive models underlying the neural control of parenting. Project Narrative We propose to develop a transformative multimodal experimental platform to uncover the brain-wide architecture of neuronal circuits underlying parenting behavior in molecular, functional, connectivity-based and computational terms.

"Data-driven analysis for neuronal dynamic modeling Project Summary / Abstract Our main goal is to unravel communication dynamics in the brain, as they relate to various sensory-motor actions and to the learning process. The sensory-motor system operates through the concerted interaction of multiple closed-loops feedback systems. While some broad level knowledge is available about single neuron properties and general high-level operations, we lack understanding of functional aspects of neural dynamics, of inter-neuronal interactions and of the modular interaction and integration of brain regions contributing to motor activity. Two photon calcium imaging has revolutionized experimental capabilities to measure large-scale neuronal activity, but poses a significant challenge in terms of massive dynamical data analysis. We intend to confront these challenges face-on, to significantly boost the quality and relevance of experimental data collected during the process of animal learning and execution of motor functions. Our goal is to build an end-to-end modular platform to organize automatically (in a data agnostic way) the dynamical observation space into dynamic scenarios corresponding to contextual groups of neuronal dynamics and to specific motor activity in different related trials. Our plan follows a path from low-level processing of raw calcium imaging data through mid-level organization of extracted neuronal time-traces and finally to high-level inference and prediction of behavior. We aim to extend prior geometric dynamics analysis methods for nonlinear empirical modeling to the complexity of the large-scale neuronal data. Our methodology leads to the determination of low-dimensional intrinsic dynamical sub-processes that provides a coherent explanation of the observed data, and to testable experimental predictions. Unlike conventional neuronal data processing postulating a-priori specific structural models, we rely only on general data-agnostic coherence assumptions. These settings remove bias due to a- priori modeling and enable developing tools that are independent of the acquisition modality, simplifying data fusion (such as neuronal and behavioral observations). Our initial experimental setup is two photon calcium imaging measurements of a head-fixed mouse, performing a motor reach task in multiple repetitive trials. The brain imaging data is synchronized with acquired high- resolution behavioral video. As we show in this proposal, we already have preliminary results demonstrating the power of our empirical analytics methods. Project Narrative In this project, we introduce a methodology for unravelling the complexity of neuronal activity in the brain of a mouse, while performing various tasks. Our main goal is to develop and provide an end-to-end system of modular mathematical tools to automatically analyze, co-organize and model massive amounts of high- resolution spatiotemporal neuronal activity with motor functions.

"CRCNS: Common algorithmic strategies used by the brain for labeling points in high-dimensional space The first major goal of this work is to learn how certain brain regions (olfactory system,  hippocampus, and cerebellum) learn very complex stimuli that employ a combinatorial code to  identify stimuli as points in a high-dimensional space. For example, the simple fruit fly  olfactory system uses the firing rates of 50 different types of odorant receptors to  identify each odor by placing it at a point in a SO-dimensional space. Although the fly olfactory  system is well understood, less is known about analogous regions in vertebrate brains, and our  goal is to begin to learn about these other regions. The first step is to start with the mouse olfactory system that is similar to the fly in some ways but has complexities that are  absent in insects. These complexities include an enhanced ability to handle noise in the  odor and to learn over time to discriminate between very similar odors (e.g., two types of  red wines). Preliminary evidence shows that it should be possible to learn the role of  these complexities in vertebrate olfaction. The research design involves studying the  anatomy and recording the firing rates of different types of neurons at different levels of the  mouse olfactory system and in applying computational methods and algorithms that have  proved successful in earlier work to describe these complexities. The second major goal is to use insights into how these brain regions operate to improve the  function of computer algorithms. For a long time, a dream of many neuroscientists and computer  scientists has been to understand how the brain works well enough that we could translate insights  from the brain to improve machine computation. Indeed, experience has shown that the brain   has evolved novel variations of information processing algorithms used by computer  scientists to solve general computational problems. With sufficient insight into algorithms  used by the brain, these insights may provide unexpected ways to improve the function computer  science algorithms. Further, understanding the circuit mechanisms involved in olfactory processing can help illuminate the basis of a variety of smell disorders, and may  in the future lead to the construction of artificial smelling devices. Our main goal is to understand what computations are used by the mammalian olfactory system; this  has two types of public relevance. First, we hope to learn what circuit mechanisms are used in  this brain region, which may help identify how disruption of these mechanisms causes  brain and olfactory malfunction.

"Regulation of social aggression through hippocampal CA2 inputs to lateral septum Heightened levels of social aggression, a motivated behavior, are often associated with neuropsychiatric disease. Although our understanding of the neural mechanisms regulating aggression is incomplete, both lateral septum (LS) and ventral hypothalamus are known to be important. Even though LS receives one of its strongest inputs from hippocampus, a region important for declarative memory, little is known about how hippocampus regulates aggression. Moreover, as hippocampus is implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders associated with altered social behavior and aggression, a basic understanding of how hippocampus and its circuitry regulate aggression will likely yield important new insights into disease mechanisms.  Here we focus on the role of the hippocampal CA2 region in social aggression. Relatively little is known about CA2, largely because of technical problems that limit its study with conventional lesioning approaches. We therefore developed a Cre mouse line that enables us to label and manipulate the activity of CA2 pyramidal neurons. Using a genetic silencing approach, we found that CA2 was critical during non-aggressive social exploration for the formation of social memory, the ability of an animal to recognize and remember another mouse (conspecific), but CA2 was not needed for other forms of hippocampal memory. Our recent results now show that CA2 also promotes social aggression, through an excitatory projection to LS that disinhibits a subnucleus in ventral medial hypothalamus important for aggression. Moreover, we find that the social neuropeptide arginine vasopressin promotes aggression by enhancing the CA2 to LS synapse.  Here we ask: How does a single brain region, CA2, participate in social memory storage during non- aggressive social exploration and promote social aggression? Is there a single population of CA2 neurons that is activated during both social exploration and social aggression? Or are there specialist neurons for each behavior? Does CA2 actively encode distinct representations of social exploration and social aggression, or does CA2 encode a single social salience signal that does not in itself encode aggression but that is gated by the internal state of an animal to promote aggression through CA2 inputs to LS? We will test the hypothesis that vasopressin release in LS acts as such a permissive gate. As vasopressin also enhances social memory by acting within CA2, we will ask: How can a single neuromodulator produce two such distinct actions? Do distinct sources of vasopressin input to CA2 and LS promote, respectively, social memory and aggression?  We will address these questions by characterizing CA2 circuits and neural activity during aggressive and non-aggressive social interactions using: 1. Activity-dependent genetic marking of active CA2 ensembles; 2. Electrophysiological characterization of CA2?LS circuits and their regulation by vasopressin in ex vivo brain slices; 3. Behavioral control of aggression using chemogenetics and optogenetics; and 4. In vivo optical and electrophysiological recordings of CA2 activity during non-aggressive and aggressive social interactions. Many neuropsychiatric disorders are associated with increased levels of aggression, which impair patient care and place a burden on society. Here we will examine the neural mechanisms by which the CA2 region of the hippocampus, a relatively unexplored brain region implicated in social memory and schizophrenia, regulates aggressive behavior in mice.",Regulation of social aggression through hippocampal CA2 inputs to lateral septum,10002290,R01MH120292,"['Aggressive behavior ', ' Aggression ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Animals ', ' Argipressin ', ' Arginine Vasopressin ', ' Vasopressin-Neurophysin II-Copeptin ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hypothalamic structure ', ' Hypothalamus ', ' hypothalamic ', ' Middle Hypothalamus ', ' Intermediate Hypothalamic Region ', ' Medial Hypothalamus ', ' Locales ', ' male ', ' Memory ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Neuropeptides ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Play ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Social Behavior ', ' sociobehavior ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Societies ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Testing ', ' Vasopressins ', ' Antidiuretic Hormone ', ' beta-Hypophamine ', ' Mediating ', ' Specialist ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' Lateral ', ' Dorsal ', ' Axon Terminals ', ' Presynaptic Nerve Endings ', ' Synaptic Boutons ', ' Synaptic Terminals ', ' Presynaptic Terminals ', ' Immediate-Early Genes ', ' Lesion ', ' insight ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Behavioral Manipulation ', ' behavioral control ', ' Behavior Control ', ' Source ', ' extracellular ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' receptor ', ' neural control ', ' neural regulation ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuroregulation ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' novel ', ' social ', ' Regulation ', ' Neuromodulator ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' in vivo ', ' Slice ', ' Monitor ', ' Output ', ' Pyramidal neuron ', ' hippocampal pyramidal neuron ', ' motivated behavior ', ' maternal aggression ', ' Population ', ' neural mechanism ', ' neuromechanism ', ' Impairment ', ' presynaptic ', ' selectively expressed ', ' selective expression ', ' optogenetics ', ' anatomical tracer ', ' anatomical tract tracer ', ' anatomical tracing ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' ']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,530057,NY-13,0.022938112897824763
"Structure and Function of a Cubic Millimeter of Cortex: Crowdsourcing for Proofreading and Discovery At the end of 2020, the IARPA MICrONS program will conclude with an automated reconstruction of all neurons in a cubic millimeter of mouse visual cortex, along with the neurons’ synaptic connectivity and calcium-imaged responses to video stimuli. We believe that this dataset could become the most widely used resource in the field of cortical circuits, but more work is required to realize this potential. We propose to create an online community called Pyr (pronounced “peer”) that takes the result of MICrONS as its starting point. We propose to detect and correct the remaining errors in the automated segmentation through automated algorithms and human proofreading working in tandem. Automated error detection and correction will utilize hand-designed heuristics as well as deep learning and deep metric learning. Proofreading will be crowdsourced to nonscientist volunteers, a concept pioneered by Eyewire, but updated to handle a 1000x larger dataset and far more accurate artificial intelligence. We expect that Pyr will generate more cortical connections than any previous study, by orders of magnitude. This information will be accompanied by calcium-imaged visual responses of 80,000 neurons. With such an enormous and rich dataset, the primary bottleneck will become scientific discovery. We propose to crowdsource discovery by assembling a community of researchers who collaborate with Pyr and each other. Discovery infrastructure will include a “Science API” that allows programmatic access to the primary and derived data through Python functions, an automated system for “materializing” the connectome that makes the result of proofreading available to researchers with essentially zero delay, and a versioning system will insure that analyses are reproducible. We will create a framework enabling the community to contribute their own kinds of annotations, which will be included in materialization. Finally, we will build interactive discovery tools that couple Science API queries with visualization. We envision a community of researchers who will build upon the above discovery infrastructure, creating and sharing analysis tools of their own. They will investigate diverse questions about cortical structure and function, including many that we cannot foresee at all. In the future, Pyr could incorporate other cortical datasets as they become available, with much less engineering effort than the original MICrONS dataset. As with MICrONS, software will be developed in the open in public github repos. This software could be reused by others to build systems similar to Pyr. This project will create Pyr, an online community that makes scientific discoveries about cortical structure and function by reconstructing and analyzing the connections between neurons in a cubic millimeter of mouse cortex along with the activity of the same neurons.

"Transcriptome-based systematic discovery of GABAergic neurons in the neocortex ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The integrated sensory, motor, and cognitive abilities that guide adaptive behavior in mammals emerge from neural circuit operations in the neocortex. Understanding the organization of cortical circuits requires comprehensive knowledge of the basic cellular components. The neocortex consists of approximately 80% glutamatergic pyramidal neurons and 20% GABAergic neurons. Although a minority, GABA interneurons are exceptionally diverse, and this diversity may be crucial in regulating the balance and functional operations of cortical circuits. However, systematic identification, enumeration and classification of GABAergic neurons have been a challenging goal. We hypothesize that distinct transcription programs underlie GABA prototype identity and diversity as defined by their position, morphology and basic innervation pattern. Thus we suggest that transcription profiling provides a fundamental starting point and efficient strategy for cell type discovery. Here we propose a multi-faceted approach that integrates genetic targeting, single cell transcriptomics, statistical and computational analysis, morpho-physiological studies to systematically identify and classify GABAergic neurons. We focus on GABA neurons derived from the embryonic medial ganglionic eminence (MGE), which constitute two-third of cortical interneurons, and for which we have built effective genetic tools. We have established a robust single cell RNAseq (scRNAseq) method that allows high resolution transcriptome profiling through single mRNA counting using nucleotide barcodes. We will take a two-step ""Targeted-Saturation"" cell screen approach toward systematic discovery of cortical GABA neurons. First, we will apply scRNAseq to a set of GABA subpopulations, captured by intersectional genetic targeting, and discover their distinct transcription signatures. With these phenotype- characterized populations, we hone our statistical analysis to distinguish biological signal vs experimental noise and artifacts, and shape our computation algorithm based on biological ground truth. Thus in contrast to a unsupervised clustering approach to transcriptome analysis, we incorporate extensive empirical information that enable a biology-motivated supervised approach, where well-delineated phenotypes play the key role of training the algorithm and classifier. Second, we will apply scRNASeq to increasingly broader genetic-defined populations of MGE-derived GABA neurons in the primary motor cortex. We will discover transcriptome-predicted cell types and build 2nd round driver lines that target and validate a subset of novel cell types. Our study will build a comprehensive catalog of a major cohort of cortical GABAergic neurons by integrating transcription profiles and basic cell phenotypes. This will establish a cellular foundation for studying inhibitory circuit organization, function, and dysfunction. 1 PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will combine genetic engineering, single cell gene expression profiling, computational analysis, anatomical and physiological approaches to systematically discover GABAergic cell types in the mouse neocortex. These studies will facilitate our understanding of the function of cortical neural circuits and yield insight into the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders. 1",Transcriptome-based systematic discovery of GABAergic neurons in the neocortex,9977809,R01MH109665,"['Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Axon ', ' Bar Codes ', ' barcode ', ' Biology ', ' Birth Order ', ' sibling order ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Censuses ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Embryo ', ' Embryonic ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Foundations ', ' gamma-Aminobutyric Acid ', ' 4-Aminobutanoic Acid ', ' 4-Aminobutyric Acid ', ' 4-amino-butanoic acid ', ' Aminalon ', ' Aminalone ', ' GABA ', ' γ-Aminobutyric Acid ', ' Ganglia ', ' Neural Ganglion ', ' Genetic Engineering ', ' Genetic Engineering Biotechnology ', ' Genetic Engineering Molecular Biology ', ' Recombinant DNA Technology ', ' genetically engineered ', ' Glutamates ', ' L-Glutamate ', ' glutamatergic ', ' Goals ', ' nerve supply ', ' innervation ', ' Interneurons ', ' Connector Neuron ', ' Intercalary Neuron ', ' Intercalated Neurons ', ' Internuncial Cell ', ' Internuncial Neuron ', ' Literature ', ' Mammals ', ' Mammalia ', ' Methods ', ' Motor Cortex ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Noise ', ' Nucleotides ', ' Parvalbumins ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Spatial Distribution ', ' Supervision ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' adaptation behavior ', ' adaptive behavior ', ' Adaptive Behaviors ', ' homotypical cortex ', ' isocortex ', ' neopallium ', ' Neocortex ', ' base ', ' Medial ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' insight ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Genetic ', ' Morphology ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Catalogs ', ' programs ', ' Sensory ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Categories ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Gene Expression Monitoring ', ' Gene Expression Pattern Analysis ', ' Transcript Expression Analyses ', ' Transcript Expression Analysis ', ' gene expression analysis ', ' gene expression assay ', ' transcriptional profiling ', ' Gene Expression Profiling ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Property ', ' Portraits ', ' Motor ', ' Resolution ', ' Classification Scheme ', ' computational analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computer analyses ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Expression Signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' gene expression signature ', ' transcriptional signature ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' Pyramidal neuron ', ' hippocampal pyramidal neuron ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' transcriptomics ', ' computer algorithm ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' prototype ', ' public health relevance ', ' molecular biomarker ', ' molecular marker ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' operation ', ' Statistics Algorithm ', ' Statistical Algorithm ', ' genetic strategy ', ' genetic approach ', ' cognitive ability ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' transcriptome ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' internet resource ', ' on-line compendium ', ' on-line resource ', ' online compendium ', ' web resource ', ' web-based resource ', ' online resource ', ' scRNA-seq ', ' single cell RNA-seq ', ' single cell RNAseq ', ' single-cell RNA sequencing ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' supervised learning ', ' learning algorithm ', ' algorithm training ', ' ']",NIMH,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,R01,2020,61299,NY-03,-0.014229744108007316
