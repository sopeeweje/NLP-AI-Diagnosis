"Functional neuroimaging of language processing in primary progressive aphasia    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is a clinical syndrome in which degeneration of language regions in the dominant hemisphere is associated with progressive deficits in speech and/or language function. The overall goals of this project are to use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate neural changes underlying linguistic deficits in PPA, and to use this information to better discriminate patients with variants of PPA from each other and from normal aging. Recent studies have identified three clinical variants of PPA: progressive non-fluent aphasia (PNFA), semantic dementia (SD) and logopenic progressive aphasia (LPA). Each variant is associated with characteristic linguistic features, distinct patterns of brain atrophy, and different likelihoods of particular underlying pathogenic processes, making correct differential diagnosis highly relevant. We will recruit 48 patients with PPA (16 of each variant) and 24 normal controls over a three year period, and acquire fMRI data along with structural MRI, linguistic and cognitive measures. The fMRI paradigm consists of a syntactic processing task with seven conditions parametrically varying in syntactic complexity. The research will address two specific aims. The first is to identify the relationships between volume loss, changes in functional MRI activation, and linguistic deficits, in the different PPA variants. The second aim is to improve differential diagnosis of PPA variants using machine learning algorithms incorporating both structural and functional imaging measures.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: PPA is a devastating disorder that prevents individuals from communicating and functioning in society. The knowledge gained in this study will increase our understanding of the neural basis of language processing and its breakdown in PPA, and will contribute to earlier, more accurate differential diagnosis of PPA variants, enabling emerging therapies to be targeted to likely underlying etiologies.              PPA is a devastating disorder that prevents individuals from communicating and functioning in society.

"Artificial Grammar Learning in Aphasia: An Implicit Learning Approach     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Implicit learning procedures have the potential to greatly enhance language training, and yet have received little attention in the aphasia rehabilitation literature. Preliminary evidence of implicit learning ability in individuals with aphasia suggests that this approach could lead to less effortful language rehabilitation strategies, which may be used in combination with established methods of explicit treatment of grammatical ability. The long-term goal of the proposed work is to further the understanding of learning processes in aphasia, and to use that knowledge to engage patients in language learning strategies that will be most beneficial for language recovery. The specific objective of the proposed project is to test an implicit approach to artificial grammar learning in healthy and agrammatic aphasic individuals using a statistical learning paradigm. The central hypothesis is that implicit learning mechanisms, which are effective in deriving grammatical structure from statistical relationships in language, remain intact in individuals with aphasia, and that grammar learning is enhanced when passive language exposure is combined with active practice. The proposed research will be the first to test learning and short-term retention of an artificial phrae structure grammar under implicit learning conditions in individuals with agrammatic aphasia and healthy age-matched adults. Participants in this study will receive repeated passive exposure to the grammar on two consecutive days, and their acquisition and 24-hour retention of the grammatical rules will be evaluated by grammaticality judgment tests. The proposed research will also use the artificial grammar learning task with healthy young adults to test the relative effects of passive exposure to the grammar compared to active practice with feedback and a combination of both approaches. These contributions are significant because they are the first steps toward evaluation of an approach that utilizes patients' retained learning abilities and hence can improve the quality of life of individuals with aphasia.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research aims to further the understanding of language learning strategies that are effective and efficient for healthy adults and for individual with impaired language as a result of brain damage.

"Neural correlates of recovery from aphasia after acute stroke     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this project is to identify the neural correlates of recovery from aphasia during the first three months after acute stroke. Aphasia is one of the most common and debilitating consequences of strokes affecting the dominant hemisphere. In the acute and subacute stages, most patients experience some degree of recovery of language function. These first few months after brain damage occurs are critically important because the greatest behavioral gains take place during this time, even when patients do not receive treatment. However the extent of recovery is highly variable: some patients recover most or nearly all language function, while others make few gains and remain chronically aphasic. It is not well understood what neural mechanisms underlie recovery during this period, nor why some patients recover so much better than others. To address these questions, we propose to study individuals with aphasia due to acute left hemisphere stroke. Patients will be examined at four time points after stroke: 24-48 hours, 2 weeks, 1 month, and 3 months. At each time point, a comprehensive yet time-efficient language evaluation will be administered to quantify expressive and receptive language function, and a multimodal brain imaging protocol will be implemented that includes structural imaging (MRI), functional imaging (fMRI), perfusion imaging (arterial spin labeling, ASL) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). The proposed research has two specific aims. The first is to identify the neural changes that are associated with successful recovery from aphasia in the acute and subacute periods after a stroke. The second aim is to determine the initial imaging and behavioral variables that are most predictive of the extent of eventual recovery of language function. We hypothesize that the inclusion of fMRI, ASL and DTI in combination with comprehensive language assessments will provide a more complete characterization of the brain's changing state than standard clinical imaging and language measures, and will explain a greater proportion of the variance in recovery patterns. A better understanding of the neural correlates of successful recovery will improve the accuracy of prognoses so as to better plan medical treatments and behavioral interventions.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Approximately one million Americans are living with aphasia, an acquired communication disorder that is one of the most common and debilitating consequences of stroke. The proposed research will use multimodal neuroimaging and comprehensive language evaluations to better understand the process of recovery from aphasia in the crucial first few months after acute stroke. The knowledge gained will help to improve accuracy of prognoses, which will support better planning of treatment and rehabilitation.            ",Neural correlates of recovery from aphasia after acute stroke,8758212,R01DC013270,"['Affect ', ' Logasthenia ', ' Logamnesia ', ' Logagnosia ', ' Aphasias ', ' Anepia ', ' Alogia ', ' Aphasia ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' necrocytosis ', ' Cell Death ', ' Communities ', ' Goals ', ' hemodynamics ', ' infarct ', ' Infarction ', ' Language ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Maps ', ' Patients ', ' Perfusion ', ' Physicians ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Physical Health Services / Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' reperfusion ', ' Reperfusion Therapy ', ' Research ', ' Speech ', ' Spin Labels ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' stroke ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Measures ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' improved ', ' brain visualization ', ' Brain imaging ', ' Left ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' prognostic ', ' aphasic ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' brain lesion (from injury) ', ' brain damage ', ' Acquired brain injury ', ' Brain Injuries ', ' Staging ', ' Pathologist ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Hour ', ' Contralateral ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' treatment planning ', ' neuroimaging ', ' substantia alba ', ' white matter ', ' Modality ', ' Acquired Communication Disorders ', ' acute cerebrovascular accident ', ' acute stroke ', ' response ', ' arterial imaging ', ' Arteriogram ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Brain region ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Address ', ' Consent ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Physiologic Imaging ', ' Functional Imaging ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' white matter damage ', ' poststroke ', ' post stroke ', ' neural mechanism ', ' neuromechanism ', ' Impairment ', ' language processing ', ' language onset ', ' web based interface ', ' public health relevance ', ' relational database ', ' Secure ', ' hypoperfusion ', ' ']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2014,445153,AZ-03,0.3310647328011321

"Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (Description as provided by applicant): Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States, making it a major public health concern (1). The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates the annual cost of stroke in the United States to be $36.5 billion (1). Accordingly, it is clear that the negative personal and societal impact of stroke is vry high. Stroke is typically thought to affect older persons; however, many younger individuals also suffer strokes. For example, at least half of all stroke patients in the state of South Carolina ar under the age of 60 (2). Approximately a quarter of all chronic stroke survivors present with aphasia, a language disorder caused by damage to the speech and language areas of the brain (3, 4). The prevalence of chronic aphasia in the United States is estimated to be one million. Aphasia can vary in severity from very profound impairment that renders patients mute and without the ability to understand others' speech, to milder forms where patients have great difficulty retrieving specific words. In the chronic stage of stroke, aphasia has been identified a the strongest predictor of poor quality of life. Aphasia not only influences the ability to communicate with family and friends, but also drastically decreases education and employment opportunities. Although some degree of spontaneous recovery from aphasia is typical in the first weeks and months following stroke, many patients are left with devastating communication problems. Once aphasia has become a chronic condition, the only road to recovery is through aphasia therapy. Several meta-analysis studies suggest that aphasia therapy is effective. In spite of decades of research, very little is known about which patients benefit the most from treatment and what kind of treatment should be administered to patients with different impairment profiles. The overarching goal of the research proposed here is to improve aphasia treatment effectiveness as well as identify patient factors that can be used to improve diagnosis of language impairment, guide aphasia treatment, and predict prognosis. Specifically, the focus of our center (Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery; C-STAR) is to examine the extent to which factors such as behavioral aphasia treatment, electrical brain stimulation, and residual brain function influence aphasia recovery. To accomplish our research goals, this project will rely on collaboration among four main investigators: Drs. Julius Fridriksson, Argye Hillis, Chris Rorden, and Greg Hickok. Projects led by Fridriksson (chronic patients) and Hillis (acute patients) will focus on factors that may promote improved outcome of aphasia therapy. Both projects will yield a vast, unique dataset including measures of brain status and response to aphasia treatment. Relying on this dataset, Rorden's project will predict recovery from aphasia using machine learning approaches whereas Hickok will utilize the same data to better understand aphasic impairment in relation to contemporary models of speech and language processing.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States; aphasia, an impairment of the ability to process language, is one of the most devastating results of left hemisphere stroke.

One of the most devastating impairments resulting from stroke is aphasia, a language impairment caused by left hemisphere damage involving cortical language areas. It is generally accepted that behavioral aphasia treatment is effective. Nevertheless, different patients experience very different degrees of benefit from aphasia treatment. Despite considerable differences in the response to aphasia treatment, the relationship between patient factors and treatment response is poorly understood and very few reliable prognostic indicators have been identified. This is a major problem, as both time and resources are wasted when clinicians do not know what patients are likely to respond to treatment, or which treatment best fits individual patients. The purpose of the current project is to develop a model that includes biographical and cognitive/linguistic factors to predict patients' response to aphasia treatment. Aphasia severity is one of the few factors that have been identified as a reliable predictor of performance in treatment; it is generally accepted that more severe aphasia is associated with poorer treatment outcomes. However, aphasia severity is a multidimensional construct and patients with similar overall severity scores might demonstrate very different language impairment profiles. To better understand how language impairment relates to treatment outcomes, the dual stream model (DS model;1) will be consulted. Specifically, we will test whether measures of proportional damage to the cortical areas that comprise the DS model improve prediction of aphasia treatment response, beyond biographical and cognitive/linguistic factors. Although the DS model is a functional model grounded in neuroanatomy, we expect measures of speech and language that assesses processes supported by the two major components of the DS model - the dorsal and ventral streams - might be redundant with measures of cortical damage. To understand whether our predictive model can be generalized across different kinds of treatment foci, each patient will undergo treatment devoted to phonological stimulation and a separate treatment phase focusing on semantic stimulation. Ultimately, the goal here is to construct a predictive model that will be made available on- line so that clinicians can enter test scores from individual patients to predic how likely a given patient is to respond to treatment, as well as the focus of that treatment.         There is a great need for prognostic indicators of aphasia treatment response. At the completion of our research, we will understand why some patients respond better to aphasia treatment than others. We have selected treatment approaches that are routinely used in clinical practice, allowing for immediate translation of the findings directly into patient management.

"Contributions of spared brain structures and connections to aphasia recovery Language impairment, or aphasia, is a common problem after left hemisphere stroke, and causes significant long-term disability. After the initial period of healing, recovery from stroke relies on plasticity in brain networks spared from direct stroke damage. Thus, to improve behavioral and biological treatments for aphasia, we must understand how spared brain structures and connections contribute to recovery. Over a century of research has demonstrated that left hemisphere areas surrounding the stroke and right hemisphere areas symmetric to the normal left hemisphere language network participate in aphasia recovery. However, the mechanisms by which these areas are recruited and their roles in language recovery remain unclear, particularly for the “right hemisphere language network.” We propose to examine the role of spared brain structures and connections in recovery of core language functions in a large group of left hemisphere stroke survivors and matched controls. The innovative methods address major limitations of prior studies by accounting for individual differences in stroke severity, using task-independent brain structure and connectivity measures, and examining several core language functions as defined by statistical analysis of an extensive behavioral assessment battery. Preliminary studies using this new approach suggest that parts of the right hemisphere language network grow after stroke, and that these changes improve language outcomes. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that recruitment of the right hemisphere language network after left hemisphere stroke compensates for language deficits. We will test this hypothesis against multiple alternative hypotheses, using advanced brain imaging methods to test for effects throughout spared parts of the brain. Analyses will examine how spared brain structures and connections contribute to language recovery, accounting for individual differences in stroke severity. We will additionally test for signs of brain plasticity after stroke and test relationships between stroke location and patterns of brain plasticity to better understand the mechanisms of recovery. New multi- modal analysis methods will integrate the brain structure and connectivity data, providing a more complete picture of recovery of language functions than has been possible before. This research will significantly advance our understanding of the biological basis of aphasia recovery, which will be vital in order to design maximally effective treatments. Language impairment, or aphasia, is a common problem after left hemisphere stroke, and causes significant long-term disability. Understanding the brain basis of recovery is critical to developing new treatments that can meaningfully improve the lives of people with aphasia.

"Neural correlates of recovery from aphasia after acute stroke DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this project is to identify the neural correlates of recovery from aphasia during the first three months after acute stroke. Aphasia is one of the most common and debilitating consequences of strokes affecting the dominant hemisphere. In the acute and subacute stages, most patients experience some degree of recovery of language function. These first few months after brain damage occurs are critically important because the greatest behavioral gains take place during this time, even when patients do not receive treatment. However the extent of recovery is highly variable: some patients recover most or nearly all language function, while others make few gains and remain chronically aphasic. It is not well understood what neural mechanisms underlie recovery during this period, nor why some patients recover so much better than others. To address these questions, we propose to study individuals with aphasia due to acute left hemisphere stroke. Patients will be examined at four time points after stroke: 24-48 hours, 2 weeks, 1 month, and 3 months. At each time point, a comprehensive yet time-efficient language evaluation will be administered to quantify expressive and receptive language function, and a multimodal brain imaging protocol will be implemented that includes structural imaging (MRI), functional imaging (fMRI), perfusion imaging (arterial spin labeling, ASL) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). The proposed research has two specific aims. The first is to identify the neural changes that are associated with successful recovery from aphasia in the acute and subacute periods after a stroke. The second aim is to determine the initial imaging and behavioral variables that are most predictive of the extent of eventual recovery of language function. We hypothesize that the inclusion of fMRI, ASL and DTI in combination with comprehensive language assessments will provide a more complete characterization of the brain's changing state than standard clinical imaging and language measures, and will explain a greater proportion of the variance in recovery patterns. A better understanding of the neural correlates of successful recovery will improve the accuracy of prognoses so as to better plan medical treatments and behavioral interventions.

"Contributions of spared brain structures and connections to aphasia recovery Language impairment, or aphasia, is a common problem after left hemisphere stroke, and causes significant long-term disability. After the initial period of healing, recovery from stroke relies on plasticity in brain networks spared from direct stroke damage. Thus, to improve behavioral and biological treatments for aphasia, we must understand how spared brain structures and connections contribute to recovery. Over a century of research has demonstrated that left hemisphere areas surrounding the stroke and right hemisphere areas symmetric to the normal left hemisphere language network participate in aphasia recovery. However, the mechanisms by which these areas are recruited and their roles in language recovery remain unclear, particularly for the “right hemisphere language network.” We propose to examine the role of spared brain structures and connections in recovery of core language functions in a large group of left hemisphere stroke survivors and matched controls. The innovative methods address major limitations of prior studies by accounting for individual differences in stroke severity, using task-independent brain structure and connectivity measures, and examining several core language functions as defined by statistical analysis of an extensive behavioral assessment battery. Preliminary studies using this new approach suggest that parts of the right hemisphere language network grow after stroke, and that these changes improve language outcomes. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that recruitment of the right hemisphere language network after left hemisphere stroke compensates for language deficits. We will test this hypothesis against multiple alternative hypotheses, using advanced brain imaging methods to test for effects throughout spared parts of the brain. Analyses will examine how spared brain structures and connections contribute to language recovery, accounting for individual differences in stroke severity. We will additionally test for signs of brain plasticity after stroke and test relationships between stroke location and patterns of brain plasticity to better understand the mechanisms of recovery. New multi- modal analysis methods will integrate the brain structure and connectivity data, providing a more complete picture of recovery of language functions than has been possible before. This research will significantly advance our understanding of the biological basis of aphasia recovery, which will be vital in order to design maximally effective treatments. Language impairment, or aphasia, is a common problem after left hemisphere stroke, and causes significant long-term disability. Understanding the brain basis of recovery is critical to developing new treatments that can meaningfully improve the lives of people with aphasia. This study uses advanced brain imaging techniques to examine how brain networks spared by the stroke contribute to recovery of language abilities in left hemisphere stroke survivors.",Contributions of spared brain structures and connections to aphasia recovery,9567461,R01DC014960,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Aphasia ', ' Logasthenia ', ' Logamnesia ', ' Logagnosia ', ' Anepia ', ' Alogia ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Biological Response Modifier Therapy ', ' biotherapy ', ' biotherapeutics ', ' biological treatment ', ' biological therapeutic ', ' Biological Therapy ', ' Biologic Therapy ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Diffusion ', ' gray matter ', ' substantia grisea ', ' Hypertrophy ', ' Language ', ' Language Disorders ', ' language deficit ', ' Language disability ', ' Linear Regressions ', ' Literature ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Production ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Speech ', ' Stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Time Study ', ' Work ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Measures ', ' Technical Expertise ', ' technical skills ', ' Factor Analysis ', ' Factor Analyses ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' morphometry ', ' brain visualization ', ' Brain imaging ', ' Left ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Lesion ', ' disability ', ' Recovery ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' programs ', ' Severities ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' neuroregulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neural regulation ', ' neural control ', ' Structure ', ' Modality ', ' Behavior assessment ', ' behavioral assessment ', ' Brain region ', ' imaging modality ', ' imaging method ', ' image-based method ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Behavioral ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' poststroke ', ' post stroke ', ' healing ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' stroke recovery ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' Individual Differences ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' multimodality ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' behavior study ', ' behavioral study ', ' support network ', ' aphasia recovery ', ' language impairment ', ' stroke survivor ', ' study population ', ' patient subtypes ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subsets ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIDCD,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,762544,DC-98,0.25795644305637394
"Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (Description as provided by applicant): Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States, making it a major public health concern (1). The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates the annual cost of stroke in the United States to be $36.5 billion (1). Accordingly, it is clear that the negative personal and societal impact of stroke is vry high. Stroke is typically thought to affect older persons; however, many younger individuals also suffer strokes. For example, at least half of all stroke patients in the state of South Carolina ar under the age of 60 (2). Approximately a quarter of all chronic stroke survivors present with aphasia, a language disorder caused by damage to the speech and language areas of the brain (3, 4). The prevalence of chronic aphasia in the United States is estimated to be one million. Aphasia can vary in severity from very profound impairment that renders patients mute and without the ability to understand others' speech, to milder forms where patients have great difficulty retrieving specific words. In the chronic stage of stroke, aphasia has been identified a the strongest predictor of poor quality of life. Aphasia not only influences the ability to communicate with family and friends, but also drastically decreases education and employment opportunities. Although some degree of spontaneous recovery from aphasia is typical in the first weeks and months following stroke, many patients are left with devastating communication problems. Once aphasia has become a chronic condition, the only road to recovery is through aphasia therapy. Several meta-analysis studies suggest that aphasia therapy is effective. In spite of decades of research, very little is known about which patients benefit the most from treatment and what kind of treatment should be administered to patients with different impairment profiles. The overarching goal of the research proposed here is to improve aphasia treatment effectiveness as well as identify patient factors that can be used to improve diagnosis of language impairment, guide aphasia treatment, and predict prognosis. Specifically, the focus of our center (Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery; C-STAR) is to examine the extent to which factors such as behavioral aphasia treatment, electrical brain stimulation, and residual brain function influence aphasia recovery. To accomplish our research goals, this project will rely on collaboration among four main investigators: Drs. Julius Fridriksson, Argye Hillis, Chris Rorden, and Greg Hickok. Projects led by Fridriksson (chronic patients) and Hillis (acute patients) will focus on factors that may promote improved outcome of aphasia therapy. Both projects will yield a vast, unique dataset including measures of brain status and response to aphasia treatment. Relying on this dataset, Rorden's project will predict recovery from aphasia using machine learning approaches whereas Hickok will utilize the same data to better understand aphasic impairment in relation to contemporary models of speech and language processing.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States; aphasia, an impairment of the ability to process language, is one of the most devastating results of left hemisphere stroke. The purpose of the work proposed here is to improve recovery from aphasia by better understanding how neurophysiology and anatomy as well as theory driven aphasia treatment relate to long-term outcome.            Subproject-1    Modeling treated recovery from aphasia    Lead Investigator: Julius Fridriksson, Ph.D.            DESCRIPTION (Description as provided by applicant): Stroke is the leading cause of serious adult disability in the United States. One of the most devastating impairments resulting from stroke is aphasia, a language impairment caused by left hemisphere damage involving cortical language areas. It is generally accepted that behavioral aphasia treatment is effective. Nevertheless, different patients experience very different degrees of benefit from aphasia treatment. Despite considerable differences in the response to aphasia treatment, the relationship between patient factors and treatment response is poorly understood and very few reliable prognostic indicators have been identified. This is a major problem, as both time and resources are wasted when clinicians do not know what patients are likely to respond to treatment, or which treatment best fits individual patients. The purpose of the current project is to develop a model that includes biographical and cognitive/linguistic factors to predict patients' response to aphasia treatment. Aphasia severity is one of the few factors that have been identified as a reliable predictor of performance in treatment; it is generally accepted that more severe aphasia is associated with poorer treatment outcomes. However, aphasia severity is a multidimensional construct and patients with similar overall severity scores might demonstrate very different language impairment profiles. To better understand how language impairment relates to treatment outcomes, the dual stream model (DS model;1) will be consulted. Specifically, we will test whether measures of proportional damage to the cortical areas that comprise the DS model improve prediction of aphasia treatment response, beyond biographical and cognitive/linguistic factors. Although the DS model is a functional model grounded in neuroanatomy, we expect measures of speech and language that assesses processes supported by the two major components of the DS model - the dorsal and ventral streams - might be redundant with measures of cortical damage. To understand whether our predictive model can be generalized across different kinds of treatment foci, each patient will undergo treatment devoted to phonological stimulation and a separate treatment phase focusing on semantic stimulation. Ultimately, the goal here is to construct a predictive model that will be made available on- line so that clinicians can enter test scores from individual patients to predic how likely a given patient is to respond to treatment, as well as the focus of that treatment.         There is a great need for prognostic indicators of aphasia treatment response. At the completion of our research, we will understand why some patients respond better to aphasia treatment than others. We have selected treatment approaches that are routinely used in clinical practice, allowing for immediate translation of the findings directly into patient management. The current project will yield a vast dataset that will be made publicly available allowing others to study further aphasia treatment response in relation to cognitive/linguistic and lesion factors.

"Neural correlates of recovery from aphasia after acute stroke DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this project is to identify the neural correlates of recovery from aphasia during the first three months after acute stroke. Aphasia is one of the most common and debilitating consequences of strokes affecting the dominant hemisphere. In the acute and subacute stages, most patients experience some degree of recovery of language function. These first few months after brain damage occurs are critically important because the greatest behavioral gains take place during this time, even when patients do not receive treatment. However the extent of recovery is highly variable: some patients recover most or nearly all language function, while others make few gains and remain chronically aphasic. It is not well understood what neural mechanisms underlie recovery during this period, nor why some patients recover so much better than others. To address these questions, we propose to study individuals with aphasia due to acute left hemisphere stroke. Patients will be examined at four time points after stroke: 24-48 hours, 2 weeks, 1 month, and 3 months. At each time point, a comprehensive yet time-efficient language evaluation will be administered to quantify expressive and receptive language function, and a multimodal brain imaging protocol will be implemented that includes structural imaging (MRI), functional imaging (fMRI), perfusion imaging (arterial spin labeling, ASL) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). The proposed research has two specific aims. The first is to identify the neural changes that are associated with successful recovery from aphasia in the acute and subacute periods after a stroke. The second aim is to determine the initial imaging and behavioral variables that are most predictive of the extent of eventual recovery of language function. We hypothesize that the inclusion of fMRI, ASL and DTI in combination with comprehensive language assessments will provide a more complete characterization of the brain's changing state than standard clinical imaging and language measures, and will explain a greater proportion of the variance in recovery patterns. A better understanding of the neural correlates of successful recovery will improve the accuracy of prognoses so as to better plan medical treatments and behavioral interventions.

"Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for Aphasia: Efficacy and Neural Basis PROJECT SUMMARY Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) has been demonstrated to improve language function in subjects with chronic aphasia in a number of small studies, many of which did not include a control group. Although the treatment appears promising, data to date do not permit an adequate assessment of the utility of the technique. We propose to study the effects of TMS combined with Constraint Induced Language Therapy (CILT) in 75 subjects with chronic aphasia. Subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to TMS with CILT or sham TMS with CILT. One Hz TMS at 90% motor threshold will be delivered to the right inferior frontal gyrus for 20 minutes in 10 sessions over 2 weeks; language therapy will be provided for one hour immediately after the conclusion of each session of TMS. Change from baseline in the Western Aphasia Battery Aphasia Quotient at 6 months after the end of TMS treatment will serve as the primary outcome measure. A secondary aim is to identify anatomic and behavioral predictors of response to treatment. Finally, a third aim is to identify the mechanism underlying the beneficial effect of the treatment using a variety of imaging techniques. Subjects who have no contraindication to the MRI will undergo fMRI imaging prior to and at 6 months after therapy. Using modern network analyses and robust machine learning techniques we will identify changes in the strengths of connections between nodes in the language network to address specific hypotheses regarding the effects of TMS and CILT on brain organization that are associated with beneficial response to treatment. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) has been demonstrated to improve language function in subjects with aphasia in many small studies, its general clinical utility has not been established.

"Academy of Aphasia Research and Training Symposium PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The annual Academy of Aphasia meeting is the premier conference for researchers in the field of language processing and aphasia. Since the first meeting in 1963, this international meeting has brought together an interdisciplinary group of linguists, psychologists, neurologists, and speech-language pathologists to discuss the latest research in the field of aphasia, including theoretical, clinical, and rehabilitation aspects of this language disorder. The topics at the conference range widely but almost always cover all aspects of language processing including phonological processing, lexical-semantic processing, syntactic processing, orthographic processing, bilingualism, computational modeling, non-invasive and invasive brain imaging, language recovery, neuroplasticity, and rehabilitation. In this proposal, we aim to include two special initiatives that will take place during the annual academy of aphasia conference. The first initiative involves a formal mentoring program for young investigators entering the field of aphasia research. In this program, selected student/post-doctoral fellows from interdisciplinary backgrounds who are first authors at the conference are paired with a mentor. This mentor will provide specific feedback about the fellow's presentation and general mentorship to the fellow about research and academic careers. This program is currently occurring as part of the conference and has been growing at the annual meeting with very positive feedback. Additionally, a formal mentoring meeting will allow a structured format for discussion about a career in aphasia research. The second initiative will be a three hour seminar (New Frontiers in Aphasia Research) that covers the background and approach of a state of the art methodology (e.g., fNIRS, graph theoretical metric, machine learning approaches) that has an application to the study of aphasia. These workshops will be recorded and, consequently, uploaded to the academy website/youtube channel for dissemination to aphasia researchers and the public. This workshop will allow conference attendees to understand the conceptual and methodological aspect of a particular scientific approach that can be implemented in their study of aphasia. Given the highly interdisciplinary nature of aphasia research, these workshops will bridge the communication between aphasia researchers and scientists and experts who have developed new approaches to study the brain. This meeting already allows a valuable opportunity for cross-pollination of research ideas and will now provide a platform for the training the next generation of scientists interested in pursuing the nature of aphasia and associated language disorders in adults. PROJECT NARRATIVE Approximately 100,000 individuals suffer from aphasia each year. The academy of aphasia is an organization of clinicians, scientists and practitioners who study this communication disorder and develop interventions to treat individuals with aphasia.

"Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (Description as provided by applicant): Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States, making it a major public health concern (1). The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates the annual cost of stroke in the United States to be $36.5 billion (1). Accordingly, it is clear that the negative personal and societal impact of stroke is vry high. Stroke is typically thought to affect older persons; however, many younger individuals also suffer strokes. For example, at least half of all stroke patients in the state of South Carolina ar under the age of 60 (2). Approximately a quarter of all chronic stroke survivors present with aphasia, a language disorder caused by damage to the speech and language areas of the brain (3, 4). The prevalence of chronic aphasia in the United States is estimated to be one million. Aphasia can vary in severity from very profound impairment that renders patients mute and without the ability to understand others' speech, to milder forms where patients have great difficulty retrieving specific words. In the chronic stage of stroke, aphasia has been identified a the strongest predictor of poor quality of life. Aphasia not only influences the ability to communicate with family and friends, but also drastically decreases education and employment opportunities. Although some degree of spontaneous recovery from aphasia is typical in the first weeks and months following stroke, many patients are left with devastating communication problems. Once aphasia has become a chronic condition, the only road to recovery is through aphasia therapy. Several meta-analysis studies suggest that aphasia therapy is effective. In spite of decades of research, very little is known about which patients benefit the most from treatment and what kind of treatment should be administered to patients with different impairment profiles. The overarching goal of the research proposed here is to improve aphasia treatment effectiveness as well as identify patient factors that can be used to improve diagnosis of language impairment, guide aphasia treatment, and predict prognosis. Specifically, the focus of our center (Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery; C-STAR) is to examine the extent to which factors such as behavioral aphasia treatment, electrical brain stimulation, and residual brain function influence aphasia recovery. To accomplish our research goals, this project will rely on collaboration among four main investigators: Drs. Julius Fridriksson, Argye Hillis, Chris Rorden, and Greg Hickok. Projects led by Fridriksson (chronic patients) and Hillis (acute patients) will focus on factors that may promote improved outcome of aphasia therapy. Both projects will yield a vast, unique dataset including measures of brain status and response to aphasia treatment. Relying on this dataset, Rorden's project will predict recovery from aphasia using machine learning approaches whereas Hickok will utilize the same data to better understand aphasic impairment in relation to contemporary models of speech and language processing.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States; aphasia, an impairment of the ability to process language, is one of the most devastating results of left hemisphere stroke. The purpose of the work proposed here is to improve recovery from aphasia by better understanding how neurophysiology and anatomy as well as theory driven aphasia treatment relate to long-term outcome.            Subproject-1    Modeling treated recovery from aphasia    Lead Investigator: Julius Fridriksson, Ph.D.            DESCRIPTION (Description as provided by applicant): Stroke is the leading cause of serious adult disability in the United States. One of the most devastating impairments resulting from stroke is aphasia, a language impairment caused by left hemisphere damage involving cortical language areas. It is generally accepted that behavioral aphasia treatment is effective. Nevertheless, different patients experience very different degrees of benefit from aphasia treatment. Despite considerable differences in the response to aphasia treatment, the relationship between patient factors and treatment response is poorly understood and very few reliable prognostic indicators have been identified. This is a major problem, as both time and resources are wasted when clinicians do not know what patients are likely to respond to treatment, or which treatment best fits individual patients. The purpose of the current project is to develop a model that includes biographical and cognitive/linguistic factors to predict patients' response to aphasia treatment. Aphasia severity is one of the few factors that have been identified as a reliable predictor of performance in treatment; it is generally accepted that more severe aphasia is associated with poorer treatment outcomes. However, aphasia severity is a multidimensional construct and patients with similar overall severity scores might demonstrate very different language impairment profiles. To better understand how language impairment relates to treatment outcomes, the dual stream model (DS model;1) will be consulted. Specifically, we will test whether measures of proportional damage to the cortical areas that comprise the DS model improve prediction of aphasia treatment response, beyond biographical and cognitive/linguistic factors. Although the DS model is a functional model grounded in neuroanatomy, we expect measures of speech and language that assesses processes supported by the two major components of the DS model - the dorsal and ventral streams - might be redundant with measures of cortical damage. To understand whether our predictive model can be generalized across different kinds of treatment foci, each patient will undergo treatment devoted to phonological stimulation and a separate treatment phase focusing on semantic stimulation. Ultimately, the goal here is to construct a predictive model that will be made available on- line so that clinicians can enter test scores from individual patients to predic how likely a given patient is to respond to treatment, as well as the focus of that treatment.         There is a great need for prognostic indicators of aphasia treatment response. At the completion of our research, we will understand why some patients respond better to aphasia treatment than others. We have selected treatment approaches that are routinely used in clinical practice, allowing for immediate translation of the findings directly into patient management. The current project will yield a vast dataset that will be made publicly available allowing others to study further aphasia treatment response in relation to cognitive/linguistic and lesion factors.

"Contributions of spared brain structures and connections to aphasia recovery Language impairment, or aphasia, is a common problem after left hemisphere stroke, and causes significant long-term disability. After the initial period of healing, recovery from stroke relies on plasticity in brain networks spared from direct stroke damage. Thus, to improve behavioral and biological treatments for aphasia, we must understand how spared brain structures and connections contribute to recovery. Over a century of research has demonstrated that left hemisphere areas surrounding the stroke and right hemisphere areas symmetric to the normal left hemisphere language network participate in aphasia recovery. However, the mechanisms by which these areas are recruited and their roles in language recovery remain unclear, particularly for the “right hemisphere language network.” We propose to examine the role of spared brain structures and connections in recovery of core language functions in a large group of left hemisphere stroke survivors and matched controls. The innovative methods address major limitations of prior studies by accounting for individual differences in stroke severity, using task-independent brain structure and connectivity measures, and examining several core language functions as defined by statistical analysis of an extensive behavioral assessment battery. Preliminary studies using this new approach suggest that parts of the right hemisphere language network grow after stroke, and that these changes improve language outcomes. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that recruitment of the right hemisphere language network after left hemisphere stroke compensates for language deficits. We will test this hypothesis against multiple alternative hypotheses, using advanced brain imaging methods to test for effects throughout spared parts of the brain. Analyses will examine how spared brain structures and connections contribute to language recovery, accounting for individual differences in stroke severity. We will additionally test for signs of brain plasticity after stroke and test relationships between stroke location and patterns of brain plasticity to better understand the mechanisms of recovery. New multi- modal analysis methods will integrate the brain structure and connectivity data, providing a more complete picture of recovery of language functions than has been possible before. This research will significantly advance our understanding of the biological basis of aphasia recovery, which will be vital in order to design maximally effective treatments. Language impairment, or aphasia, is a common problem after left hemisphere stroke, and causes significant long-term disability. Understanding the brain basis of recovery is critical to developing new treatments that can meaningfully improve the lives of people with aphasia. This study uses advanced brain imaging techniques to examine how brain networks spared by the stroke contribute to recovery of language abilities in left hemisphere stroke survivors.",Contributions of spared brain structures and connections to aphasia recovery,9981076,R01DC014960,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Aphasia ', ' Logasthenia ', ' Logamnesia ', ' Logagnosia ', ' Anepia ', ' Alogia ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Biological Response Modifier Therapy ', ' Biologic Therapy ', ' biotherapy ', ' biotherapeutics ', ' biological treatment ', ' biological therapeutic ', ' Biological Therapy ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Diffusion ', ' substantia grisea ', ' gray matter ', ' Hypertrophy ', ' Language ', ' language deficit ', ' Language disability ', ' Language Disorders ', ' Linear Regressions ', ' Literature ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Production ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Speech ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Stroke ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Time Study ', ' Work ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Measures ', ' technical skills ', ' Technical Expertise ', ' Factor Analyses ', ' Factor Analysis ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' morphometry ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Left ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Lesion ', ' disability ', ' Recovery ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' programs ', ' Severities ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' neuroregulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neural regulation ', ' neural control ', ' Structure ', ' behavioral assessment ', ' Behavior assessment ', ' Brain region ', ' imaging method ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' post stroke ', ' poststroke ', ' after stroke ', ' healing ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' stroke recovery ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' Individual Differences ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' behavioral study ', ' behavior study ', ' support network ', ' aphasia recovery ', ' recovery in aphasia ', ' language impairment ', ' stroke survivor ', ' study population ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subtypes ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subgroups ', ' recruit ', ' language outcome ', ' ']",NIDCD,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,103338,DC-98,0.25795644305637394
"Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR) To address the National Institute on Aging’s strategic aim of understanding mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of AD, related dementias, and neurodegenerative disorders of aging (Goal D-2), we propose an extension to Project 1 of the currently funded Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR; P50 DC014664, referred to here as POLAR) to investigate further neurological and health-related factors that predict cognitive-linguistic decline in stroke survivors. Aphasia, a language impairment caused by damage to the brain's language regions, persists chronically in approximately 30% of stroke survivors. POLAR is a treatment study that aims to identify neuroanatomical, behavioral, genetic, and demographic predictors of treated aphasia recovery in individuals with chronic left hemisphere stroke. Preliminary analyses have shown that not all individuals improve, and recent evidence suggests that approximately one-quarter of individuals with post-stroke aphasia experience cognitive-linguistic decline over time. The purpose of this project is to extend the follow-up window for the POLAR study, to one-year post aphasia treatment. There is evidence to suggest that declining performance in stroke-induced aphasia is attributed to pathologic changes in the brain's white matter, referred to as leukoaraiosis. Leukoaraiosis is common in stroke survivors, and is often attributed to age, as well as cardiovascular health and other health concerns. In the general population, it has been associated with cognitive decline and loss of functional ability. By extending follow-up interval for the POLAR study, this study will address a new aim of evaluating the progression of leukoaraiosis and how it affects overall cognitive-linguistic ability in stroke survivors. To this end, participants will undergo the same speech/language and cognitive testing administered at study baseline. Participants will also undergo the same magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocol as at baseline (see the attached POLAR Research Strategy). The extent of behavioral change will be evaluated and related to neuroanatomical changes. The role of cognitive reserve and other personal factors in mediating the effects of leukoaraiosis will also be explored. The world’s population is aging, and with this trend, the global burden of stroke and dementia is also increasing. The study of leukoaraiosis in post-stroke aphasia is critical for identifying factors that may indicate cognitive-linguistic decline in stroke survivors, as doing so will also inform efforts to improve the evaluation of individuals at risk for developing cognitive impairment, AD, and other dementias (NIA Strategic Goal D-3). The world’s population is aging, and by 2050, it is expected that 17% of the world’s population (i.e., 1.6 billion people) will be over the age of 65 (1). Along with this increase in older individuals, the global burden of stroke (2) and dementia (3) is also increasing. The coming decades are expected to see a significant growth in the number of individuals living longer with post-stroke sequelae, attributed to the decline in stroke mortality rates (2, 4) and an increase in stroke rates in younger individuals (e.g., 20-44 years old (5); 45-64 years old (6)). In parallel, as individuals age, the prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other dementias continues to increase (3). This epidemiological trend means that aging research must consider the effects of stroke on the aging brain – and likewise – stroke research must consider how processes associated with aging affect long term outcomes. In essence, stroke survivors are aging, and aging research must consider this population, especially considering that by 2030, the number of stroke survivors could reach 70 million people worldwide (2). Accordingly, to address the National Institute on Aging’s strategic aim of understanding mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of AD, related dementias, and neurodegenerative disorders of aging (Goal D-2), we propose an extension to Project 1 of the currently funded Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (CSTAR; P50 DC014664, referred to here as POLAR) to investigate further neurological and health-related factors that predict cognitive-linguistic decline in stroke survivors.

"Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for Aphasia: Efficacy and Neural Basis PROJECT SUMMARY Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) has been demonstrated to improve language function in subjects with chronic aphasia in a number of small studies, many of which did not include a control group. Although the treatment appears promising, data to date do not permit an adequate assessment of the utility of the technique. We propose to study the effects of TMS combined with Constraint Induced Language Therapy (CILT) in 75 subjects with chronic aphasia. Subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to TMS with CILT or sham TMS with CILT. One Hz TMS at 90% motor threshold will be delivered to the right inferior frontal gyrus for 20 minutes in 10 sessions over 2 weeks; language therapy will be provided for one hour immediately after the conclusion of each session of TMS. Change from baseline in the Western Aphasia Battery Aphasia Quotient at 6 months after the end of TMS treatment will serve as the primary outcome measure.

"Academy of Aphasia Research and Training Symposium PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The annual Academy of Aphasia meeting is the premier conference for researchers in the field of language processing and aphasia. Since the first meeting in 1963, this international meeting has brought together an interdisciplinary group of linguists, psychologists, neurologists, and speech-language pathologists to discuss the latest research in the field of aphasia, including theoretical, clinical, and rehabilitation aspects of this language disorder. The topics at the conference range widely but almost always cover all aspects of language processing including phonological processing, lexical-semantic processing, syntactic processing, orthographic processing, bilingualism, computational modeling, non-invasive and invasive brain imaging, language recovery, neuroplasticity, and rehabilitation. In this proposal, we aim to include two special initiatives that will take place during the annual academy of aphasia conference. The first initiative involves a formal mentoring program for young investigators entering the field of aphasia research. In this program, selected student/post-doctoral fellows from interdisciplinary backgrounds who are first authors at the conference are paired with a mentor. This mentor will provide specific feedback about the fellow's presentation and general mentorship to the fellow about research and academic careers. This program is currently occurring as part of the conference and has been growing at the annual meeting with very positive feedback. Additionally, a formal mentoring meeting will allow a structured format for discussion about a career in aphasia research. The second initiative will be a three hour seminar (New Frontiers in Aphasia Research) that covers the background and approach of a state of the art methodology (e.g., fNIRS, graph theoretical metric, machine learning approaches) that has an application to the study of aphasia. These workshops will be recorded and, consequently, uploaded to the academy website/youtube channel for dissemination to aphasia researchers and the public. This workshop will allow conference attendees to understand the conceptual and methodological aspect of a particular scientific approach that can be implemented in their study of aphasia. Given the highly interdisciplinary nature of aphasia research, these workshops will bridge the communication between aphasia researchers and scientists and experts who have developed new approaches to study the brain. This meeting already allows a valuable opportunity for cross-pollination of research ideas and will now provide a platform for the training the next generation of scientists interested in pursuing the nature of aphasia and associated language disorders in adults. PROJECT NARRATIVE Approximately 100,000 individuals suffer from aphasia each year. The academy of aphasia is an organization of clinicians, scientists and practitioners who study this communication disorder and develop interventions to treat individuals with aphasia. The members comprise a very interdisciplinary group of linguists, psychologists, speech and language clinicians, neurologists and neuroscientists. The annual academy of aphasia meeting is the premier venue to share state of the art methodologies for application in the study of aphasia to improve the research in the development of diagnosis and treatment approaches to alleviate aphasia. This conference is also the ideal venue to educate and train the next generation of aphasia researchers who are well trained from a theoretical, technical and clinical standpoint and are committed to expand the impact of research in aphasia.",Academy of Aphasia Research and Training Symposium,9731439,R13DC017375,"['Academy ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Aphasia ', ' Logasthenia ', ' Logamnesia ', ' Logagnosia ', ' Anepia ', ' Alogia ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Chicago ', ' Communication ', ' Communicative Disorders ', ' Communication Disorders ', ' Communication impairment ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Feedback ', ' Fellowship ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Governing Board ', ' Grant ', ' Language ', ' language deficit ', ' Language disability ', ' Language Disorders ', ' Learning ', ' Linguistic ', ' Linguistics ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mission ', ' neuroplasticity ', ' neuroplastic ', ' neural plasticity ', ' CNS plasticity ', ' Neuronal Plasticity ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Production ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Psychologist ', ' Psychology ', ' Publishing ', ' Reading ', ' rehabilitative therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Support ', ' Rest ', ' Speech ', ' Speech Perception ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Stroke ', ' Students ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' Videotape ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Image Analysis ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Clinical ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Neurologist ', ' Recovery ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Fostering ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' bilingualism ', ' bilingual ', ' Pathologist ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Committee Membership ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Transcranial magnetic stimulation ', ' Hour ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' Training and Education ', ' Education and Training ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' syntax ', ' syntactic ', ' phonology ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Manuscripts ', ' Structure ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Graph ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Orthography ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Research Training ', ' Retrieval ', ' Speech Pathologist ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders ', ' NIDCD ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' next generation ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' Outcome ', ' Non-aphasic ', ' frontier ', ' semantic processing ', ' language processing ', ' lexical ', ' Secure ', ' career networking ', ' speed networking ', ' professional networking ', ' career fair ', ' tenure track ', ' tenure process ', ' improved outcome ', ' ']",NIDCD,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R13,2019,39939,MA-07,0.3845472981749155
"Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for Aphasia: Efficacy and Neural Basis PROJECT SUMMARY Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) has been demonstrated to improve language function in subjects with chronic aphasia in a number of small studies, many of which did not include a control group. Although the treatment appears promising, data to date do not permit an adequate assessment of the utility of the technique. We propose to study the effects of TMS combined with Constraint Induced Language Therapy (CILT) in 75 subjects with chronic aphasia. Subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to TMS with CILT or sham TMS with CILT. One Hz TMS at 90% motor threshold will be delivered to the right inferior frontal gyrus for 20 minutes in 10 sessions over 2 weeks; language therapy will be provided for one hour immediately after the conclusion of each session of TMS. Change from baseline in the Western Aphasia Battery Aphasia Quotient at 6 months after the end of TMS treatment will serve as the primary outcome measure. A secondary aim is to identify anatomic and behavioral predictors of response to treatment. Finally, a third aim is to identify the mechanism underlying the beneficial effect of the treatment using a variety of imaging techniques.

"Cognitive and Neural Basis of Functional Communication Deficits in Post-Stroke Aphasia Project Summary/Abstract Aphasia is an impairment of language that is a common consequence of stroke and has serious negative effects on health and well-being. Aphasia diagnosis continues to be organized around a 19th century model of the neural basis of language, but cognitive neuroscience research over the last 15-20 years has converged to a very different model of the cognitive and neural organization of spoken language. This contemporary model provides a precise computational account of the sub-systems that support spoken language, but does not explain how those sub-systems produce functional communication – the outcome that is most important to people with aphasia and to clinicians. The long-term goal of this project is to develop theory-informed, clinically-relevant prognostic tools that combine behavioral and neuroimaging information. The overall objective of this application is to determine the relationships between spoken functional communication impairments of language sub-systems, and neuroanatomical disruption in chronic post-stroke aphasia. The overall project is divided into three specific aims: (1) Determine how spoken functional communication is related to deficits in language sub-systems. We will test how the three key language sub-systems – semantics, phonology, and sentence planning – are related to functional communication in a large sample of individuals with post-stroke aphasia. (2) Identify the lesion correlates of spoken functional communication deficits using lesion-symptom mapping. We will conduct the first LSM study of spoken functional communication using multimodal neuroimaging and machine learning tools to discover robust lesion correlates of spoken functional communication. (3) Develop a prediction model of chronic language sub-system and functional communication deficits based on acute lesion data. Routine clinical neuroimaging data collected in the acute stage (48-72 hours after stroke) will be used to build and evaluate a prediction model of chronic deficits in language sub- systems and functional communication. Upon completion of this project, we will have determined how behavioral deficits and lesion patterns are related to functional communication deficits, and developed a prediction model of such deficits based on acute-stage clinical neuroimaging. This integration of psycholinguistics, neuroanatomy, and functional communication will provide theory-informed, clinically-relevant predictions of communication deficits. This project addresses NIDCD Strategic Priority Area 3 (Improving Diagnosis, Treatment, and Prevention) by developing a neural biomarker of objective diagnosis and prognosis for acquired language impairments. Project Narrative This project will integrate investigate how the cognitive and neural sub-systems that support spoken language work together to allow speakers with language deficits to convey their message.

"Contributions of spared brain structures and connections to aphasia recovery Language impairment, or aphasia, is a common problem after left hemisphere stroke, and causes significant long-term disability. After the initial period of healing, recovery from stroke relies on plasticity in brain networks spared from direct stroke damage. Thus, to improve behavioral and biological treatments for aphasia, we must understand how spared brain structures and connections contribute to recovery. Over a century of research has demonstrated that left hemisphere areas surrounding the stroke and right hemisphere areas symmetric to the normal left hemisphere language network participate in aphasia recovery. However, the mechanisms by which these areas are recruited and their roles in language recovery remain unclear, particularly for the “right hemisphere language network.” We propose to examine the role of spared brain structures and connections in recovery of core language functions in a large group of left hemisphere stroke survivors and matched controls. The innovative methods address major limitations of prior studies by accounting for individual differences in stroke severity, using task-independent brain structure and connectivity measures, and examining several core language functions as defined by statistical analysis of an extensive behavioral assessment battery. Preliminary studies using this new approach suggest that parts of the right hemisphere language network grow after stroke, and that these changes improve language outcomes. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that recruitment of the right hemisphere language network after left hemisphere stroke compensates for language deficits. We will test this hypothesis against multiple alternative hypotheses, using advanced brain imaging methods to test for effects throughout spared parts of the brain. Analyses will examine how spared brain structures and connections contribute to language recovery, accounting for individual differences in stroke severity. We will additionally test for signs of brain plasticity after stroke and test relationships between stroke location and patterns of brain plasticity to better understand the mechanisms of recovery. New multi- modal analysis methods will integrate the brain structure and connectivity data, providing a more complete picture of recovery of language functions than has been possible before. This research will significantly advance our understanding of the biological basis of aphasia recovery, which will be vital in order to design maximally effective treatments. Language impairment, or aphasia, is a common problem after left hemisphere stroke, and causes significant long-term disability. Understanding the brain basis of recovery is critical to developing new treatments that can meaningfully improve the lives of people with aphasia.

"Neural Correlates of Recovery from Aphasia After Stroke Project Summary/Abstract Aphasia is one of the most common and debilitating consequences of stroke. Aphasia is caused by damage to language regions of the brain, which are usually localized to the left hemisphere. Fortunately, most individuals with aphasia after a stroke experience some degree of recovery of language function over time. The pace of recovery is greatest in the first weeks and months, but clinically meaningful gains in language function are possible even years after stroke. Recovery from aphasia is thought to depend on neural plasticity, that is, functional reorganization of surviving brain regions such that they take on new or expanded roles in language processing. However, despite much research, the mechanisms that underlie this process of functional reorganization remain poorly understood. The overall goals of this project are to better characterize the neural correlates of recovery from aphasia after stroke, and to determine which patterns of functional reorganization are associated with more or less favorable language outcomes. To address major limitations of prior studies, we will use a range of innovative approaches. Adaptive language mapping paradigms will be used to identify language regions in a reliable and valid manner, while minimizing performance confounds. We will recruit large numbers of patients at two established sites, enabling rigorous statistical approaches such as linear mixed models and permutation testing. Advanced machine learning algorithms will allow us to disentangle complex relationships between structural damage, neurofunctional changes, and language outcomes. We will study two complementary cohorts of patients—acute and chronic—longitudinally using the same multimodal functional and structural MRI protocol, and the same language evaluations. In the acute cohort, we will investigate the dynamics of early recovery and functional reorganization, while in the chronic cohort, we will identify relationships between patterns of reorganization and language outcomes in a larger sample, and track the neural correlates of recovery in the chronic phase. Our first specific aim is to build predictive models of the trajectory of evolving aphasia profiles based on structural neuroimaging, including lesion location and extent, as well as multiple measures of the integrity of surviving tissue, and other clinical variables. Our second specific aim is to characterize the brain regions recruited for language processing in people with aphasia, and to identify patterns that are associated with more or less favorable outcomes. Critically, the key analyses will use the predictive models from Aim 1 to determine which patterns of functional reorganization result in better or worse outcomes relative to what would be expected on the basis of structural and clinical factors alone. Our third aim is to identify changes in functional activity associated with gains in language function over time, again in the context of the predictive models developed in Aim 1. A better understanding of the biological mechanisms that underlie recovery from aphasia will contribute to the development of neuromodulatory and therapeutic interventions, and will improve the clinical management of individuals with aphasia.

"Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR) DESCRIPTION (Description as provided by applicant): Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States, making it a major public health concern (1). The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates the annual cost of stroke in the United States to be $36.5 billion (1). Accordingly, it is clear that the negative personal and societal impact of stroke is vry high. Stroke is typically thought to affect older persons; however, many younger individuals also suffer strokes. For example, at least half of all stroke patients in the state of South Carolina ar under the age of 60 (2). Approximately a quarter of all chronic stroke survivors present with aphasia, a language disorder caused by damage to the speech and language areas of the brain (3, 4). The prevalence of chronic aphasia in the United States is estimated to be one million. Aphasia can vary in severity from very profound impairment that renders patients mute and without the ability to understand others' speech, to milder forms where patients have great difficulty retrieving specific words. In the chronic stage of stroke, aphasia has been identified a the strongest predictor of poor quality of life. Aphasia not only influences the ability to communicate with family and friends, but also drastically decreases education and employment opportunities. Although some degree of spontaneous recovery from aphasia is typical in the first weeks and months following stroke, many patients are left with devastating communication problems. Once aphasia has become a chronic condition, the only road to recovery is through aphasia therapy. Several meta-analysis studies suggest that aphasia therapy is effective. In spite of decades of research, very little is known about which patients benefit the most from treatment and what kind of treatment should be administered to patients with different impairment profiles. The overarching goal of the research proposed here is to improve aphasia treatment effectiveness as well as identify patient factors that can be used to improve diagnosis of language impairment, guide aphasia treatment, and predict prognosis. Specifically, the focus of our center (Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery; C-STAR) is to examine the extent to which factors such as behavioral aphasia treatment, electrical brain stimulation, and residual brain function influence aphasia recovery. To accomplish our research goals, this project will rely on collaboration among four main investigators: Drs. Julius Fridriksson, Argye Hillis, Chris Rorden, and Greg Hickok. Projects led by Fridriksson (chronic patients) and Hillis (acute patients) will focus on factors that may promote improved outcome of aphasia therapy. Both projects will yield a vast, unique dataset including measures of brain status and response to aphasia treatment. Relying on this dataset, Rorden's project will predict recovery from aphasia using machine learning approaches whereas Hickok will utilize the same data to better understand aphasic impairment in relation to contemporary models of speech and language processing. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States; aphasia, an impairment of the ability to process language, is one of the most devastating results of left hemisphere stroke. The purpose of the work proposed here is to improve recovery from aphasia by better understanding how neurophysiology and anatomy as well as theory driven aphasia treatment relate to long-term outcome.",Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR),9889924,P50DC014664,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Aphasia ', ' Alogia ', ' Anepia ', ' Logagnosia ', ' Logamnesia ', ' Logasthenia ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Communication ', ' Data Collection ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Electric Stimulation ', ' Electrical Stimulation ', ' electrostimulation ', ' Employment ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Language ', ' Language Disorders ', ' Language disability ', ' language deficit ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Literature ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' mortality ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Patients ', ' Perfusion ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prognosis ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Savings ', ' Social isolation ', ' South Carolina ', ' Speech ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Friends ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Treatment Effectiveness ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Left ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Residual ', ' Residual state ', ' Lesion ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' cerebral ', ' Cerebrum ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Acquired brain injury ', ' brain damage ', ' brain-injured ', ' Brain Injuries ', ' Collaborations ', ' Electrical Stimulation of the Brain ', ' SSRI ', ' SSRIs ', ' Selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor ', ' serotonin reuptake inhibitor ', ' Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Severities ', ' Location ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' behavioral test ', ' behavior test ', ' acute cerebrovascular accident ', ' acute stroke ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' fitness ', ' Data ', ' Collection ', ' Employment Opportunities ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' Impairment ', ' chronic stroke ', ' speech processing ', ' language processing ', ' public health relevance ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' treatment response ', ' recovery in aphasia ', ' aphasia recovery ', ' prediction of response ', ' predictive response ', ' predictor of response ', ' response prediction ', ' predicting response ', ' improved outcome ', ' language impairment ', ' stroke survivor ', ' stroke patient ', ' ']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,P50,2020,2187036,SC-06,0.4098749054590935
"Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for Aphasia: Efficacy and Neural Basis PROJECT SUMMARY Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) has been demonstrated to improve language function in subjects with chronic aphasia in a number of small studies, many of which did not include a control group. Although the treatment appears promising, data to date do not permit an adequate assessment of the utility of the technique. We propose to study the effects of TMS combined with Constraint Induced Language Therapy (CILT) in 75 subjects with chronic aphasia. Subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to TMS with CILT or sham TMS with CILT. One Hz TMS at 90% motor threshold will be delivered to the right inferior frontal gyrus for 20 minutes in 10 sessions over 2 weeks; language therapy will be provided for one hour immediately after the conclusion of each session of TMS. Change from baseline in the Western Aphasia Battery Aphasia Quotient at 6 months after the end of TMS treatment will serve as the primary outcome measure. A secondary aim is to identify anatomic and behavioral predictors of response to treatment. Finally, a third aim is to identify the mechanism underlying the beneficial effect of the treatment using a variety of imaging techniques. Subjects who have no contraindication to the MRI will undergo fMRI imaging prior to and at 6 months after therapy. Using modern network analyses and robust machine learning techniques we will identify changes in the strengths of connections between nodes in the language network to address specific hypotheses regarding the effects of TMS and CILT on brain organization that are associated with beneficial response to treatment. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) has been demonstrated to improve language function in subjects with aphasia in many small studies, its general clinical utility has not been established.

"Academy of Aphasia Research and Training Symposium PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The annual Academy of Aphasia meeting is the premier conference for researchers in the field of language processing and aphasia. Since the first meeting in 1963, this international meeting has brought together an interdisciplinary group of linguists, psychologists, neurologists, and speech-language pathologists to discuss the latest research in the field of aphasia, including theoretical, clinical, and rehabilitation aspects of this language disorder. The topics at the conference range widely but almost always cover all aspects of language processing including phonological processing, lexical-semantic processing, syntactic processing, orthographic processing, bilingualism, computational modeling, non-invasive and invasive brain imaging, language recovery, neuroplasticity, and rehabilitation. In this proposal, we aim to include two special initiatives that will take place during the annual academy of aphasia conference. The first initiative involves a formal mentoring program for young investigators entering the field of aphasia research. In this program, selected student/post-doctoral fellows from interdisciplinary backgrounds who are first authors at the conference are paired with a mentor. This mentor will provide specific feedback about the fellow's presentation and general mentorship to the fellow about research and academic careers. This program is currently occurring as part of the conference and has been growing at the annual meeting with very positive feedback. Additionally, a formal mentoring meeting will allow a structured format for discussion about a career in aphasia research. The second initiative will be a three hour seminar (New Frontiers in Aphasia Research) that covers the background and approach of a state of the art methodology (e.g., fNIRS, graph theoretical metric, machine learning approaches) that has an application to the study of aphasia. These workshops will be recorded and, consequently, uploaded to the academy website/youtube channel for dissemination to aphasia researchers and the public. This workshop will allow conference attendees to understand the conceptual and methodological aspect of a particular scientific approach that can be implemented in their study of aphasia. Given the highly interdisciplinary nature of aphasia research, these workshops will bridge the communication between aphasia researchers and scientists and experts who have developed new approaches to study the brain. This meeting already allows a valuable opportunity for cross-pollination of research ideas and will now provide a platform for the training the next generation of scientists interested in pursuing the nature of aphasia and associated language disorders in adults. PROJECT NARRATIVE Approximately 100,000 individuals suffer from aphasia each year. The academy of aphasia is an organization of clinicians, scientists and practitioners who study this communication disorder and develop interventions to treat individuals with aphasia. The members comprise a very interdisciplinary group of linguists, psychologists, speech and language clinicians, neurologists and neuroscientists. The annual academy of aphasia meeting is the premier venue to share state of the art methodologies for application in the study of aphasia to improve the research in the development of diagnosis and treatment approaches to alleviate aphasia. This conference is also the ideal venue to educate and train the next generation of aphasia researchers who are well trained from a theoretical, technical and clinical standpoint and are committed to expand the impact of research in aphasia.",Academy of Aphasia Research and Training Symposium,9944489,R13DC017375,"['Academy ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Aphasia ', ' Alogia ', ' Anepia ', ' Logagnosia ', ' Logamnesia ', ' Logasthenia ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Chicago ', ' Communication ', ' Communication impairment ', ' Communication Disorders ', ' Communicative Disorders ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Feedback ', ' Fellowship ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Governing Board ', ' Grant ', ' Language ', ' Language Disorders ', ' Language disability ', ' language deficit ', ' Learning ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mission ', ' Neuronal Plasticity ', ' CNS plasticity ', ' central nervous system plasticity ', ' neural plasticity ', ' neuroplastic ', ' neuroplasticity ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Production ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prognosis ', ' Psychologist ', ' Psychology ', ' Publishing ', ' Reading ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' rehab therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' rehabilitative therapy ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Research Support ', ' Rest ', ' Speech ', ' Speech Perception ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Students ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' Videotape ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' symposium ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' brain visualization ', ' Brain imaging ', ' Clinical ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Neurologist ', ' Recovery ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Fostering ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' bilingual ', ' bilingualism ', ' Pathologist ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Committee Membership ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Transcranial magnetic stimulation ', ' Hour ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' Postdoc ', ' Research Associate ', ' post-doc ', ' post-doctoral ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' Education and Training ', ' Training and Education ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' syntactic ', ' syntax ', ' phonology ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Manuscripts ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Graph ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Orthography ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Research Training ', ' Retrieval ', ' Speech Pathologist ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' NIDCD ', ' National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' next generation ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' Non-aphasic ', ' frontier ', ' semantic processing ', ' language processing ', ' lexical ', ' Secure ', ' career fair ', ' professional networking ', ' speed networking ', ' career networking ', ' tenure process ', ' tenure track ', ' improved outcome ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' Computer Models ', ' ']",NIDCD,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R13,2020,39939,MA-07,0.3845472981749155
"Contributions of spared brain structures and connections to aphasia recovery Language impairment, or aphasia, is a common problem after left hemisphere stroke, and causes significant long-term disability. After the initial period of healing, recovery from stroke relies on plasticity in brain networks spared from direct stroke damage. Thus, to improve behavioral and biological treatments for aphasia, we must understand how spared brain structures and connections contribute to recovery. Over a century of research has demonstrated that left hemisphere areas surrounding the stroke and right hemisphere areas symmetric to the normal left hemisphere language network participate in aphasia recovery. However, the mechanisms by which these areas are recruited and their roles in language recovery remain unclear, particularly for the “right hemisphere language network.” We propose to examine the role of spared brain structures and connections in recovery of core language functions in a large group of left hemisphere stroke survivors and matched controls. The innovative methods address major limitations of prior studies by accounting for individual differences in stroke severity, using task-independent brain structure and connectivity measures, and examining several core language functions as defined by statistical analysis of an extensive behavioral assessment battery. Preliminary studies using this new approach suggest that parts of the right hemisphere language network grow after stroke, and that these changes improve language outcomes. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that recruitment of the right hemisphere language network after left hemisphere stroke compensates for language deficits. We will test this hypothesis against multiple alternative hypotheses, using advanced brain imaging methods to test for effects throughout spared parts of the brain. Analyses will examine how spared brain structures and connections contribute to language recovery, accounting for individual differences in stroke severity. We will additionally test for signs of brain plasticity after stroke and test relationships between stroke location and patterns of brain plasticity to better understand the mechanisms of recovery. New multi- modal analysis methods will integrate the brain structure and connectivity data, providing a more complete picture of recovery of language functions than has been possible before. This research will significantly advance our understanding of the biological basis of aphasia recovery, which will be vital in order to design maximally effective treatments. Language impairment, or aphasia, is a common problem after left hemisphere stroke, and causes significant long-term disability. Understanding the brain basis of recovery is critical to developing new treatments that can meaningfully improve the lives of people with aphasia. This study uses advanced brain imaging techniques to examine how brain networks spared by the stroke contribute to recovery of language abilities in left hemisphere stroke survivors.",Contributions of spared brain structures and connections to aphasia recovery,9988227,R01DC014960,"['Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Diffusion ', ' gray matter ', ' substantia grisea ', ' Hypertrophy ', ' Language ', ' Language Disorders ', ' Language disability ', ' language deficit ', ' Linear Regressions ', ' Literature ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Production ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Speech ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Time Study ', ' Work ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Measures ', ' Technical Expertise ', ' technical skills ', ' Factor Analyses ', ' Factor Analysis ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' morphometry ', ' brain visualization ', ' Brain imaging ', ' Left ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Lesion ', ' disability ', ' Recovery ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' programs ', ' Severities ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' neural control ', ' neural regulation ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuroregulation ', ' Structure ', ' behavioral assessment ', ' Behavior assessment ', ' Brain region ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Behavioral ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' after stroke ', ' poststroke ', ' post stroke ', ' healing ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' stroke recovery ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' Individual Differences ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' multi-modality ', ' multimodality ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' behavior study ', ' behavioral study ', ' support network ', ' recovery in aphasia ', ' aphasia recovery ', ' language impairment ', ' stroke survivor ', ' study population ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' patient subsets ', ' recruit ', ' language outcome ', ' Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Aphasia ', ' Alogia ', ' Anepia ', ' Logagnosia ', ' Logamnesia ', ' Logasthenia ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Biological Response Modifier Therapy ', ' Biologic Therapy ', ' Biological Therapy ', ' biological therapeutic ', ' biological treatment ', ' biotherapeutics ', ' biotherapy ', ' ']",NIDCD,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,837117,DC-98,0.25795644305637394
"Cognitive and Neural Basis of Functional Communication Deficits in Post-Stroke Aphasia Project Summary/Abstract Aphasia is an impairment of language that is a common consequence of stroke and has serious negative effects on health and well-being. Aphasia diagnosis continues to be organized around a 19th century model of the neural basis of language, but cognitive neuroscience research over the last 15-20 years has converged to a very different model of the cognitive and neural organization of spoken language. This contemporary model provides a precise computational account of the sub-systems that support spoken language, but does not explain how those sub-systems produce functional communication – the outcome that is most important to people with aphasia and to clinicians. The long-term goal of this project is to develop theory-informed, clinically-relevant prognostic tools that combine behavioral and neuroimaging information. The overall objective of this application is to determine the relationships between spoken functional communication impairments of language sub-systems, and neuroanatomical disruption in chronic post-stroke aphasia. The overall project is divided into three specific aims: (1) Determine how spoken functional communication is related to deficits in language sub-systems. We will test how the three key language sub-systems – semantics, phonology, and sentence planning – are related to functional communication in a large sample of individuals with post-stroke aphasia. (2) Identify the lesion correlates of spoken functional communication deficits using lesion-symptom mapping. We will conduct the first LSM study of spoken functional communication using multimodal neuroimaging and machine learning tools to discover robust lesion correlates of spoken functional communication. (3) Develop a prediction model of chronic language sub-system and functional communication deficits based on acute lesion data. Routine clinical neuroimaging data collected in the acute stage (48-72 hours after stroke) will be used to build and evaluate a prediction model of chronic deficits in language sub- systems and functional communication. Upon completion of this project, we will have determined how behavioral deficits and lesion patterns are related to functional communication deficits, and developed a prediction model of such deficits based on acute-stage clinical neuroimaging. This integration of psycholinguistics, neuroanatomy, and functional communication will provide theory-informed, clinically-relevant predictions of communication deficits. This project addresses NIDCD Strategic Priority Area 3 (Improving Diagnosis, Treatment, and Prevention) by developing a neural biomarker of objective diagnosis and prognosis for acquired language impairments. Project Narrative This project will integrate investigate how the cognitive and neural sub-systems that support spoken language work together to allow speakers with language deficits to convey their message. The studies apply machine learning tools to behavioral assessments, neuroimaging, and measures of functional communication in order to reveal how they are related.
