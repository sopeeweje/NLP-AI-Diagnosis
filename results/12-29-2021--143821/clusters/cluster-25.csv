"An implantable device to predict and prevent seizures    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): After the first four years of our Bioengineering Research Partnership, implantable devices for epilepsy are now a reality. This is due, in part, to translation of technology developed by our group to industry. Data from multi-center clinical trials of first generation responsive antiepileptic devices indicate that this new technology is safe, and that there is promise of significant benefit to patients. They also demonstrate that 1st-generation devices rarely make patients seizure free. This is because we do not yet understand when, where and how to deliver electrical stimulation to pre-empt seizures, or the mechanisms underlying seizure generation in epileptic networks. These challenges, and translating them into more effective second-generation devices, are the focus of this proposal. Specifically, our aims are: (1) To understand mechanisms underlying seizure generation in two well characterized, spontaneously seizing animal models of epilepsy with documented similarities to refractory human epilepsy, (2) To map seizure generation in the epileptic network to determine where to place sensing electrodes and when to stimulate to maximize seizure suppression and minimize side effects. (3) To develop more effective closed loop stimulation algorithms for controlling seizures. These Aims will be accomplished through a series of projects led by established collaborators in neurology, neuroscience, bioengineering and industry, at Penn, CHOP, Georgia Tech, and BioQuantix, Inc. Teams will focus on improving upon results from first-generation human devices through detailed animal experiments on multiple temporal and spatial scales. These include: (1) the cellular level, through broad-band unit recording and biophysically accurate computational modeling; (2) the network level, with in vitro experiments on hippocampal slices using voltage sensitive dyes and multi-electrode arrays; and (3) the whole brain level, through simultaneous micro and macroelectrode field recordings and responsive brain stimulation in vivo. These experiments will build upon the substantial progress made during the first cycle of our Bioengineering Research Partnership grant. The unique composition of our group, its track record of successful technology transfer, and our ability to learn from and immediately convey our discoveries to existing programmable devices, provide an unprecedented opportunity to perform cutting-edge neuroscience and bioengineering research and immediately translate it into better treatment for patients.           ",An implantable device to predict and prevent seizures,7808779,R01NS041811,"['computerized data processing ', ' signal processing ', ' data processing ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Dyes ', ' Coloring Agents ', ' Eels ', ' Anguilliformes ', ' Electric Stimulation ', ' Electrical Stimulation ', ' Electrodes ', ' Elements ', ' Engineering ', ' Epilepsy ', ' epileptogenic ', ' epileptiform ', ' epilepsia ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' Epileptics ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial ', ' multi site clinical trial ', ' multi site clinical study ', ' multi center clinical trial ', ' multi center clinical study ', ' Multi-site clinical trial ', ' Multi-site clinical study ', ' Multi-center clinical trial ', ' Multi-center clinical study ', ' Resolution ', ' in vitro Model ', ' in vivo ', ' Rodent Model ', ' Slice ', ' Evolution ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Feedback ', ' base ', ' Grant ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hippocampus ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Algorithms ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Refractory ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Series ', ' Animal Experiments ', ' Metabotropic Glutamate Receptors ', ' Link ', ' implantable device ', ' indwelling device ', ' implant device ', ' biomedical implant ', ' In Vitro ', ' Industry ', ' Interneurons ', ' Internuncial Neuron ', ' Internuncial Cell ', ' Intercalated Neurons ', ' Intercalary Neuron ', ' Connector Neuron ', ' Learning ', ' insight ', ' Technology Transfer ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Neurology ', ' Neurosciences ', ' neurosurgery ', ' Collaborations ', ' Simulate ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Animal Experimentation ', ' Animal Research ', ' Animal Experimental Use ', ' Animals ', ' Patients ', ' Genetic ', ' Antiepileptic Agents ', ' Antiepileptics ', ' Antiepileptic Drugs ', ' Anti-epileptic ', ' Probability ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Seizures ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Frequency ', ' Event ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' interest ', ' Biomedical Engineering ', ' bioengineering ', ' experience ', ' voltage ', ' V (voltage) ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' novel ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' Prevention ', ' Devices ', ' Subclinical Seizures ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Mediating ', ' Adverse effects ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' clinical investigation ', ' markov model ', ' Outcome ', ' Synaptic plasticity ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Drops ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2010,1249881,PA-03,0.33181903003167196
"Neurophysiologically Based Responsive Pharmacotherapy for Epilepsy     DESCRIPTION: Despite taking daily medications, over 1/3 of patients with epilepsy continue to have seizures, and many  more experience significant adverse side effects from antiepileptic drugs (AED). Though patients may spend as little as 0.01% of their time actually having seizures, they must maintain chronic therapeutic AED levels for years to decades. The reason AEDs are taken daily for seizures that only occur sporadically, and in many  cases infrequently, is because patients do not know when a seizure will strike. Arguably the unpredictability of seizures and the adverse cognitive and physical side effects associated with AEDs, are the most disabling aspects of epilepsy. We now have compelling evidence from humans that seizures are not random events, but rather are associated with intracranial EEG (lEEG) changes that occur tens of minutes to hours before clinical events. This research has lead NeuroVista Inc. to develop a seizure advisory system (SAS) that uses iEEG and machine learning algorithms to track the probability of seizure occurrence. Using patient specific algorithms NeuroVista's SAS can forecast periods of increased and decreased seizure likelihood with high sensitivity and specificity, benchmarked against a chance predictor. NeuroVista's SAS has been validated in humans undergoing IEEG monitoring for epilepsy surgery, and has recently been approved for a human pilot clinical trial in Australia.  We propose to use the NeuroVista's SAS device to guide the delivery of AEDs. We hypothesize that intelligent delivery of AEDs at times of increased seizure likelihood will effectively prevent clinical seizures.  During periods of low seizure likelihood AEDs would not be required, reducing side effects. In this proposal we develop and test neurophysiologically-based responsive pharmacotherapy in naturally occurring canine epilepsy as the first step in creating a new treatment paradigm for medically resistant human partial epilepsy.  Naturally occurring canine partial epilepsy is an ideal model for developing this therapy because of the clinical, physiological, and pharmacological similarities between canine and human partial epilepsy. In addition, dogs are large enough to tolerate implantation of the human SAS device. This project will lead to submission of an investigational device exemption to conduct a first-in-human clinical trial of SAS guided responsive AED therapy.        Disclaimer:  Please note that the following critiques were prepared by the reviewers prior to the Study Section meeting and are provided in an essentially unedited form.

"Reliable Seizure Prediction Using Physiological Signals and Machine Learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For most individuals living with epilepsy, seizures are relatively infrequent events occupying a small fraction of their life. Despite spending as little a 0.01% of their lives having seizures (typically only minutes per month), people with epilepsy take anti-epileptic drugs (AED) daily, suffer AED related side effects, and spend their lives dreading when the next seizure will strike. The apparent randomness of seizures is associated with significant psychological consequences. In addition, despite daily AED approximately 1/3 of patients continue to have seizures. We hypothesize that epilepsy can be more effectively treated, both the seizures and their psychological impact, by providing patients with real-time seizure forecasting. Periods of low seizure probability would not require AEDs, or at least lower doses of AEDs, thus reducing AED exposure and their side effects. Periods of high seizure probability may respond to acute AED and patients could alter their activities to avoid injury. Patients would be empowered to manage their medications and life activities using reliable seizure forecasts. In this grant we investigate the hypothesis that seizures are predictable events, and pursue accurate, clinically relevant seizure forecasting using recent advances in support vector machines (SVM), data-analytic models, and Universum-SVM applied to continuous intracranial EEG (iEEG) in focal canine epilepsy. This is an initial step in establishin a new treatment paradigm for focal epilepsy, whereby the probability of seizure occurrence is continuously tracked for patient warning and intelligent responsive therapies. Naturally occurring focal canine epilepsy is an excellent model for investigation of seizure forecasting because of the clinical and electrophsyiological similarity to focal human epilepsy. This study provides a unique opportunity to study seizure forecasting in naturally occurring canine epilepsy under uniform conditions (the same environment). Importantly, dogs are large enough to accommodate devices designed for human use. The hypotheses driving this proposal are that focal seizures are not random events and there are brain states associated with low or high probability of seizure occurrence, and that these states can be reliably classified using machine learning approaches (SVM & Universum-SVM) that combine features from iEEG, behavioral state tracking, and electrocardiogram (ECG) heart rate variability. The goal of this proposal is to develop reliable seizure forecasting (when possible) and improved understanding (data characterization) when good forecasting is not possible.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This grant proposes to develop the capability for accurate, reliable seizure forecasting using recent advances in support vector machines, data-analytic models, and Universum-SVM applied to continuous intracranial EEG canines with naturally occurring epilepsy.

"Characterizing High Frequency Oscillations as an epilepsy biomarker with Big Data tools ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epilepsy is one of the world's most prevalent diseases, yet the rate of uncontrolled seizures has not changed in decades. One of the reasons for this is our limited understanding of seizure mechanisms, and so one of the main goals of epilepsy research is to identify new biomarkers to help us understand the nature of the disease. Recent technological advancements now allow us to monitor brain activity with much higher resolution, which have led to the identification of promising potential biomarkers such as High Frequency Oscillations (HFOs). Unfortunately, clinicians still have not determined how to utilize this information under clinical conditions. There are three main obstacles to implementing HFOs in practice: 1) it is unclear how to acquire them in a practical way; 2) it is unclear how to ascertain which HFOs are truly related to epilepsy; and 3) it is unclear how to use the HFO data in a prospective fashion to improve clinical care. The purpose of this project is overcome each of these obstacles. The first Aim validates a universal computer algorithm that can identify HFOs automatically, then tests how to use HFO rate as method to identify where seizures will start. This method improves upon past work by improving the precision of HFO detection and determining how to avoid false predictions that would lead to unnecessary surgery. The second Aim addresses a major unsolved problem in HFO research: HFOs are seen in normal brain as well as in epilepsy. This Aim will use state-of-the- art machine learning tools to process a vast dataset of HFO collected from over 100 patients to determine how to distinguish epileptic from normal HFOs. The third Aim will analyze how HFOs change over time, a largely unexplored characteristic of HFOs that cannot be evaluated without very large datasets.

"Computer-aided detection of focal cortical dysplasias ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project proposes to build computer-aided detection (CAD) software for use in identifying cortical malformations known as focal cortical dysplasia's (FCDs), which are a common cause of epileptic seizures. The intent is for the software, used by a neuroradiologist at a clinical workstation, to decrease the time- intensive nature of the visual search for cortical dysplasia's, while simultaneously increasing sensitivity o dysplasia identification, thus reducing the number of missed lesions and making neuroradiologists more effective and more efficient.  Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder, characterized by recurrent unprovoked seizures, that exacts a large toll upon society in terms of both quality of life and health care costs. Malformations of cortical development (MCD) are the most common cause of seizures in children and the second most common cause in adults. Focal cortical dysplasia is a common form of MCD that is responsible for the vast majority of treatment resistant epilepsy in patients with MCD, and when anti-epileptic medication is ineffective, detection of FCD becomes critical to the ability of the epilepsy team to offer surgery which is often these patient's last hope for seizure freedom.  Unfortunately, the radiological diagnosis of FCD is exceedingly difficult in a large percentage of cases due to their focal and subtle nature. Thus, while resection of these dysplasias can often cure seizures, they can be missed for years or decades, resulting in increased neurological damage and degradation of quality of life due to chronic seizures. In principle high resolution MRI can be used to increase diagnostic accuracy. While this is becoming more common in clinical practice, the need for high patient throughput, lack of clinical information and inexperience often results i these lesions being missed on routine clinical reads by neuroradiologists.  The project will build upon a foundation of existing technology for the generation of quantitative measures of the human brain based on MRI imaging, known in the neuroimaging research domain as FreeSurfer. The project will make use of an MRI dataset of 100 subjects with histologically-confirmed FCD to be labeled by four neuroradiologists, and control subjects with epilepsy that is not due to FCD. The project has three aims: gathering the dataset and expansion of the detection algorithms tested in Phase I to include additional MRI biomarkers; development of an MRI scanner slice prescription component to ensure imaging of an FCD at the optimal visualization plane; and an aim to submit a commercialized version of FreeSurfer for FDA 510(k) clearance. The latter aim is important for the long-term project goal of advancing the state of other clinical detection methods through the building of additional CAD tools making use of FreeSurfer's brain measures, including diseases as varied as Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, tumor monitoring and hydrocephalus.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposal is to build software for computer-aided detection of focal cortical dysplasias (FCDs), a malformation of brain development that is a common cause of epileptic seizures in children and adults. The proposed software will offer a neuroradiologist a faster and more accurate detection method compared to visual inspection only. By identifying abnormalities otherwise missed, the ensuing surgical removal of an abnormality can often stop seizures.            ",Computer-aided detection of focal cortical

"A Brain Atlas for Mapping Connectivity in Focal Epilepsy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Treatment of intractable focal epilepsy by resection of the seizure onset zone (SOZ) is often effective provided the SOZ can be reliably identified. Focal epilepsy, however, is fundamentally a network-based disease. The seizure onset zone is connected to a network whose other nodes may also exhibit abnormal neural activity either concurrently or subsequently. In patients without MRI detectable lesions, differentiation of the onset zone from these other nodes in the network can be difficult, even with the use of invasive recordings. The goal of this project is to improve SOZ identification, ultimately reducing the need for presurgical invasive recordings where possible, and guiding placement of electrodes in those patients who do need invasive monitoring. To achieve this goal, in Aim 1 we will build a functional connectivity atlas from a database of invasive Cortico-Cortical Evoked Potential (CCEP) recordings to identify common interaction networks in patients with partial epilepsy and to investigate the degree to which these are dependent on the location of the SOZ. To construct the atlas, patient data will be coregistered to a labelled anatomical atlas using a cortically constrained warping of each subject's structural MRI. In Aim 2, CCEPs data will be supplemented in the atlas with other data that provide additional insight into the brain regions involved in the seizure: regions of hypometabolism in interictal FDG PET, hypermetabolism in ictal SPECT, interictal spike localization from EEG and MEG and invasive recordings, functional areas associated with seizure semiology, MR-identified lesions, area of resection, post-surgical Engel classification. Using machine-learning methods, we will perform a sequence of tests to examine the degree to which the atlas can be used to identify the SOZ in individual subjects. Finally, in Aim 3, we will investigate the potential for using regional connectivity established frm noninvasive MEG data and resting state MRI in combination with the CCEPs atlas to identify these networks, with the ultimate goal of reducing the need for invasive monitoring. Retrospective analysis using a leave-one- out approach and comparison with outcomes will be used to quantify improvement in identification of the onset zone from both invasive and noninvasive recordings.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Epilepsy affects millions of Americans, and for many, surgery is the best option to control their seizures. Improved surgical outcomes, however, requires a better understanding of the brain networks involved in seizure propagation. A brain atlas using data recorded from electrodes implanted in patients will yield new insights into pathways of the brain and will ultimately assist neurologists and neurosurgeons in better localizing and resecting the area of the brain that is causing seizures.            ",A Brain Atlas for Mapping Connectivity in Focal Epilepsy,8900645,R01NS089212,"['Affect ', ' Atlases ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Electrodes ', ' Implanted Electrodes ', ' EEG ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' epileptogenic ', ' epileptiform ', ' epilepsia ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' Epileptics ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Partial Seizure Disorder ', ' Localization-Related Epilepsy ', ' Focal Seizure Disorder ', ' Focal Epilepsy ', ' Partial Epilepsies ', ' Evoked Potentials ', ' Exhibits ', ' Goals ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Rad.-PET ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Scan ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Medical Imaging ', ' PETT ', ' PETSCAN ', ' PET imaging ', ' PET Scan ', ' PET ', ' Positron-Emission Tomography ', ' Rest ', ' Scalp ', ' Scalp structure ', ' Seizures ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Single-Photon Emission-Computed Radionuclide Tomography ', ' Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) ', ' SPECT imaging ', ' SPECT ', ' Medical Imaging, Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography ', ' Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon ', ' computerized tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' catscan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' EMI scan ', ' Computerized Axial Tomography (Computerized Tomography) ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' CT scan ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CAT scan ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' Measures ', ' Frontal Lobe Epilepsy ', ' density ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Left ', ' Area ', ' Lesion ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Neurologist ', ' neuro-surgeon ', ' Neurosurgeon ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' interest ', ' American ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' novel ', ' Categories ', ' Modality ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' Excision ', ' brain pathway ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' fluorodeoxyglucose PET ', ' FDG PET ', ' fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Measurable ', ' Monitor ', ' Resected ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' Implant ', ' Network-based ', ' public health relevance ', ' pre-implantation ', ' preimplantation ', ' ']",NINDS,CLEVELAND CLINIC LERNER COM-CWRU,R01,2015,552097,OH-11,0.3601742230529542
"Reliable Seizure Prediction Using Physiological Signals and Machine Learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For most individuals living with epilepsy, seizures are relatively infrequent events occupying a small fraction of their life. Despite spending as little a 0.01% of their lives having seizures (typically only minutes per month), people with epilepsy take anti-epileptic drugs (AED) daily, suffer AED related side effects, and spend their lives dreading when the next seizure will strike. The apparent randomness of seizures is associated with significant psychological consequences. In addition, despite daily AED approximately 1/3 of patients continue to have seizures. We hypothesize that epilepsy can be more effectively treated, both the seizures and their psychological impact, by providing patients with real-time seizure forecasting. Periods of low seizure probability would not require AEDs, or at least lower doses of AEDs, thus reducing AED exposure and their side effects. Periods of high seizure probability may respond to acute AED and patients could alter their activities to avoid injury. Patients would be empowered to manage their medications and life activities using reliable seizure forecasts. In this grant we investigate the hypothesis that seizures are predictable events, and pursue accurate, clinically relevant seizure forecasting using recent advances in support vector machines (SVM), data-analytic models, and Universum-SVM applied to continuous intracranial EEG (iEEG) in focal canine epilepsy. This is an initial step in establishin a new treatment paradigm for focal epilepsy, whereby the probability of seizure occurrence is continuously tracked for patient warning and intelligent responsive therapies. Naturally occurring focal canine epilepsy is an excellent model for investigation of seizure forecasting because of the clinical and electrophsyiological similarity to focal human epilepsy. This study provides a unique opportunity to study seizure forecasting in naturally occurring canine epilepsy under uniform conditions (the same environment). Importantly, dogs are large enough to accommodate devices designed for human use. The hypotheses driving this proposal are that focal seizures are not random events and there are brain states associated with low or high probability of seizure occurrence, and that these states can be reliably classified using machine learning approaches (SVM & Universum-SVM) that combine features from iEEG, behavioral state tracking, and electrocardiogram (ECG) heart rate variability.

"Characterizing High Frequency Oscillations as an epilepsy biomarker with Big Data tools ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epilepsy is one of the world's most prevalent diseases, yet the rate of uncontrolled seizures has not changed in decades. One of the reasons for this is our limited understanding of seizure mechanisms, and so one of the main goals of epilepsy research is to identify new biomarkers to help us understand the nature of the disease. Recent technological advancements now allow us to monitor brain activity with much higher resolution, which have led to the identification of promising potential biomarkers such as High Frequency Oscillations (HFOs). Unfortunately, clinicians still have not determined how to utilize this information under clinical conditions. There are three main obstacles to implementing HFOs in practice: 1) it is unclear how to acquire them in a practical way; 2) it is unclear how to ascertain which HFOs are truly related to epilepsy; and 3) it is unclear how to use the HFO data in a prospective fashion to improve clinical care. The purpose of this project is overcome each of these obstacles. The first Aim validates a universal computer algorithm that can identify HFOs automatically, then tests how to use HFO rate as method to identify where seizures will start. This method improves upon past work by improving the precision of HFO detection and determining how to avoid false predictions that would lead to unnecessary surgery. The second Aim addresses a major unsolved problem in HFO research: HFOs are seen in normal brain as well as in epilepsy. This Aim will use state-of-the- art machine learning tools to process a vast dataset of HFO collected from over 100 patients to determine how to distinguish epileptic from normal HFOs. The third Aim will analyze how HFOs change over time, a largely unexplored characteristic of HFOs that cannot be evaluated without very large datasets. These Aims together serve as the framework to establish HFOs as a clinically viable biomarker of seizures, allowing their translation into clinical epilepsy care and leading to future prospective clinical studies identifying the location and timing of seizure onset. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to characterize a novel biomarker of seizures using advanced computer algorithms that monitor brainwaves in real time.

In Aim 2, CCEPs data will be supplemented in the atlas with other data that provide additional insight into the brain regions involved in the seizure: regions of hypometabolism in interictal FDG PET, hypermetabolism in ictal SPECT, interictal spike localization from EEG and MEG and invasive recordings, functional areas associated with seizure semiology, MR-identified lesions, area of resection, post-surgical Engel classification. Using machine-learning methods, we will perform a sequence of tests to examine the degree to which the atlas can be used to identify the SOZ in individual subjects. Finally, in Aim 3, we will investigate the potential for using regional connectivity established frm noninvasive MEG data and resting state MRI in combination with the CCEPs atlas to identify these networks, with the ultimate goal of reducing the need for invasive monitoring. Retrospective analysis using a leave-one- out approach and comparison with outcomes will be used to quantify improvement in identification of the onset zone from both invasive and noninvasive recordings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Epilepsy affects millions of Americans, and for many, surgery is the best option to control their seizures. Improved surgical outcomes, however, requires a better understanding of the brain networks involved in seizure propagation. A brain atlas using data recorded from electrodes implanted in patients will yield new insights into pathways of the brain and will ultimately assist neurologists and neurosurgeons in better localizing and resecting the area of the brain that is causing seizures.",A Brain Atlas for Mapping Connectivity in Focal Epilepsy,9021699,R01NS089212,"['Affect ', ' Atlases ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Electrodes ', ' Implanted Electrodes ', ' EEG ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' epileptogenic ', ' epileptiform ', ' epilepsia ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' Epileptics ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Partial Seizure Disorder ', ' Localization-Related Epilepsy ', ' Focal Seizure Disorder ', ' Focal Epilepsy ', ' Partial Epilepsies ', ' Evoked Potentials ', ' Exhibits ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Maps ', ' Patients ', ' positron emitting tomography ', ' positron emission tomographic imaging ', ' positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging ', ' Rad.-PET ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Scan ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Medical Imaging ', ' PETT ', ' PETSCAN ', ' PET imaging ', ' PET Scan ', ' PET ', ' Positron-Emission Tomography ', ' Rest ', ' Scalp ', ' Scalp structure ', ' Seizures ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Single-Photon Emission-Computed Radionuclide Tomography ', ' SPECT imaging ', ' SPECT ', ' Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon ', ' computerized tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' catscan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' EMI scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' CT scan ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CAT scan ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' Measures ', ' Frontal Lobe Epilepsy ', ' density ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Left ', ' Area ', ' Lesion ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Neurologist ', ' neuro-surgeon ', ' Neurosurgeon ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' interest ', ' American ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' novel ', ' Categories ', ' Modality ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' Excision ', ' brain pathway ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' fluorodeoxyglucose PET ', ' FDG PET ', ' fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Measurable ', ' Monitor ', ' Resected ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' Implant ', ' Network-based ', ' preimplantation ', ' pre-implantation ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' ']",NINDS,CLEVELAND CLINIC LERNER COM-CWRU,R01,2016,531286,OH-11,0.3601742230529542
"Computer-aided detection of focal cortical dysplasias ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project proposes to build computer-aided detection (CAD) software for use in identifying cortical malformations known as focal cortical dysplasia's (FCDs), which are a common cause of epileptic seizures. The intent is for the software, used by a neuroradiologist at a clinical workstation, to decrease the time- intensive nature of the visual search for cortical dysplasia's, while simultaneously increasing sensitivity o dysplasia identification, thus reducing the number of missed lesions and making neuroradiologists more effective and more efficient.  Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder, characterized by recurrent unprovoked seizures, that exacts a large toll upon society in terms of both quality of life and health care costs. Malformations of cortical development (MCD) are the most common cause of seizures in children and the second most common cause in adults. Focal cortical dysplasia is a common form of MCD that is responsible for the vast majority of treatment resistant epilepsy in patients with MCD, and when anti-epileptic medication is ineffective, detection of FCD becomes critical to the ability of the epilepsy team to offer surgery which is often these patient's last hope for seizure freedom.  Unfortunately, the radiological diagnosis of FCD is exceedingly difficult in a large percentage of cases due to their focal and subtle nature. Thus, while resection of these dysplasias can often cure seizures, they can be missed for years or decades, resulting in increased neurological damage and degradation of quality of life due to chronic seizures. In principle high resolution MRI can be used to increase diagnostic accuracy. While this is becoming more common in clinical practice, the need for high patient throughput, lack of clinical information and inexperience often results i these lesions being missed on routine clinical reads by neuroradiologists.  The project will build upon a foundation of existing technology for the generation of quantitative measures of the human brain based on MRI imaging, known in the neuroimaging research domain as FreeSurfer. The project will make use of an MRI dataset of 100 subjects with histologically-confirmed FCD to be labeled by four neuroradiologists, and control subjects with epilepsy that is not due to FCD. The project has three aims: gathering the dataset and expansion of the detection algorithms tested in Phase I to include additional MRI biomarkers; development of an MRI scanner slice prescription component to ensure imaging of an FCD at the optimal visualization plane; and an aim to submit a commercialized version of FreeSurfer for FDA 510(k) clearance. The latter aim is important for the long-term project goal of advancing the state of other clinical detection methods through the building of additional CAD tools making use of FreeSurfer's brain measures, including diseases as varied as Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, tumor monitoring and hydrocephalus. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposal is to build software for computer-aided detection of focal cortical dysplasias (FCDs), a malformation of brain development that is a common cause of epileptic seizures in children and adults. The proposed software will offer a neuroradiologist a faster and more accurate detection method compared to visual inspection only.

"Characterizing High Frequency Oscillations as an epilepsy biomarker with Big Data tools ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epilepsy is one of the world's most prevalent diseases, yet the rate of uncontrolled seizures has not changed in decades. One of the reasons for this is our limited understanding of seizure mechanisms, and so one of the main goals of epilepsy research is to identify new biomarkers to help us understand the nature of the disease. Recent technological advancements now allow us to monitor brain activity with much higher resolution, which have led to the identification of promising potential biomarkers such as High Frequency Oscillations (HFOs). Unfortunately, clinicians still have not determined how to utilize this information under clinical conditions. There are three main obstacles to implementing HFOs in practice: 1) it is unclear how to acquire them in a practical way; 2) it is unclear how to ascertain which HFOs are truly related to epilepsy; and 3) it is unclear how to use the HFO data in a prospective fashion to improve clinical care. The purpose of this project is overcome each of these obstacles. The first Aim validates a universal computer algorithm that can identify HFOs automatically, then tests how to use HFO rate as method to identify where seizures will start. This method improves upon past work by improving the precision of HFO detection and determining how to avoid false predictions that would lead to unnecessary surgery. The second Aim addresses a major unsolved problem in HFO research: HFOs are seen in normal brain as well as in epilepsy. This Aim will use state-of-the- art machine learning tools to process a vast dataset of HFO collected from over 100 patients to determine how to distinguish epileptic from normal HFOs. The third Aim will analyze how HFOs change over time, a largely unexplored characteristic of HFOs that cannot be evaluated without very large datasets. These Aims together serve as the framework to establish HFOs as a clinically viable biomarker of seizures, allowing their translation into clinical epilepsy care and leading to future prospective clinical studies identifying the location and timing of seizure onset. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to characterize a novel biomarker of seizures using advanced computer algorithms that monitor brainwaves in real time. These biomarkers, known as High Frequency Oscillations, have been recognized for some time but their research has been restricted to very short datasets within a handful of centers worldwide.

"Exploring thalamocortical neural state space for adaptive closed-loop deep brain stimulation of epileptic networks. Despite the high prevalence of epilepsy, which affects nearly 4% of the population over their lifetime, roughly one third of afflicted patients are incompletely responsive to anticonvulsant drugs, requiring in severe cases neurosurgical resections or novel approaches such as deep-brain stimulation (DBS). Recently, I helped develop an electrophysiology-based online DBS protocol for seizure detection and interruption in rodent models of absence epilepsy, a form of epilepsy involving aberrant thalamocortical activity. However, like other online DBS procedures which detect seizures as they occur, there was little ability to predict incipient seizures due in large part to limited spatiotemporal resolution of the signal we used, the electrocorticogram (ECoG). ECoG and related electroencephalogram (EEG), being large scale local field potential approaches, do not provide single-cell resolution of neural dynamics that are likely required to obtain predictive information. Over the last decade, the field of brain-machine interface (BMI) has made breakthroughs in neuroscience and engineering by developing methods for multi-electrode array recording of large scale neural spiking activity and efficient reduction of the resultant high-dimensional neural activity to a smaller number of dimensions to effectively control neural prostheses. We predict that this approach will be invaluable for understanding neural dynamics during seizures and stimulation, and for developing predictive algorithms and adaptive DBS protocols.  Therefore, the goal of this project is to precisely characterize thalamocortical neural activity during spontaneous absence seizures and following thalamic stimulation by combining large-scale thalamic and cortical neural recordings, optogenetics, and BMI mathematical techniques. Additionally, the experiments presented in this proposal will use the recorded neural activity to develop adaptive algorithms that both predict oncoming seizure activity and modify stimulation parameters based on the neural state and response to stimulation in real-time. This proposal is aimed towards increasing our understanding of the neural dynamics of epileptic networks and improving the efficacy and safety of online DBS. Roughly one third of epileptic patients are resistant to pharmacological treatment, which has promoted the development of deep brain stimulation (DBS) as a means to detect and prevent seizures. However, the neural activity underlying epileptic discharges and the effects of DBS on this activity are poorly understood, partially due to the limited information carried by the EEG signals used for monitoring seizures. A more precise characterization of epileptic neural circuits is crucial to improve current DBS design and enhance the sensitivity and efficacy of seizure detection and disruption, which demands the tools and resources of basic research.",Exploring thalamocortical neural state space for adaptive closed-loop deep brain stimulation of epileptic networks.,9257233,F31NS100265,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anticonvulsive Drugs ', ' Anticonvulsive Agents ', ' Anticonvulsant Drugs ', ' Anticonvulsant Agent ', ' Anticonvulsants ', ' Awareness ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Electrodes ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Engineering ', ' epileptogenic ', ' epileptiform ', ' epilepsia ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' Epileptics ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epilepsy ', ' petit mal seizure ', ' Pyknolepsy ', ' Pykno-Epilepsy ', ' Petit Mal Epilepsy ', ' Petit Mal Convulsion ', ' Minor Epilepsy ', ' Juvenile Absence Epilepsy ', ' Childhood Absence Epilepsy ', ' Absence Seizures ', ' Absence Seizure Disorder ', ' Absence Epilepsy ', ' Exhibits ', ' Goals ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Methods ', ' Motor Cortex ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Neurons ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Patients ', ' Primates ', ' Primates Mammals ', ' Rattus ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Rat ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Rodentia ', ' Safety ', ' Seizures ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' thalamic ', ' Thalamus ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Refractory ', ' insight ', ' Generalized seizures ', ' Individual ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Deep Brain Stimulation ', ' Principal Component Analysis ', ' Principal Component Analyses ', ' Electrocorticogram ', ' electrocorticography ', ' Dimensions ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' neural prosthesis ', ' neural prosthetic ', ' neuroregulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neural regulation ', ' neural control ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Sorting - Cell Movement ', ' sorting ', ' Appearance ', ' Excision ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' neural circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Detection ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Interruption ', ' Resolution ', ' Pharmacological Treatment ', ' Rodent Model ', ' Monitor ', ' Preparation ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Electroencephalogram ', ' Output ', ' markov model ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' brain machine interface ', ' Population ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' Implant ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' optogenetics ', ' multi-electrode arrays ', ' multielectrode arrays ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' high dimensionality ', ' ']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F31,2017,44044,CA-18,0.32645874612668363
"Reliable Seizure Prediction Using Physiological Signals and Machine Learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For most individuals living with epilepsy, seizures are relatively infrequent events occupying a small fraction of their life. Despite spending as little a 0.01% of their lives having seizures (typically only minutes per month), people with epilepsy take anti-epileptic drugs (AED) daily, suffer AED related side effects, and spend their lives dreading when the next seizure will strike. The apparent randomness of seizures is associated with significant psychological consequences. In addition, despite daily AED approximately 1/3 of patients continue to have seizures. We hypothesize that epilepsy can be more effectively treated, both the seizures and their psychological impact, by providing patients with real-time seizure forecasting. Periods of low seizure probability would not require AEDs, or at least lower doses of AEDs, thus reducing AED exposure and their side effects. Periods of high seizure probability may respond to acute AED and patients could alter their activities to avoid injury. Patients would be empowered to manage their medications and life activities using reliable seizure forecasts. In this grant we investigate the hypothesis that seizures are predictable events, and pursue accurate, clinically relevant seizure forecasting using recent advances in support vector machines (SVM), data-analytic models, and Universum-SVM applied to continuous intracranial EEG (iEEG) in focal canine epilepsy. This is an initial step in establishin a new treatment paradigm for focal epilepsy, whereby the probability of seizure occurrence is continuously tracked for patient warning and intelligent responsive therapies. Naturally occurring focal canine epilepsy is an excellent model for investigation of seizure forecasting because of the clinical and electrophsyiological similarity to focal human epilepsy. This study provides a unique opportunity to study seizure forecasting in naturally occurring canine epilepsy under uniform conditions (the same environment). Importantly, dogs are large enough to accommodate devices designed for human use. The hypotheses driving this proposal are that focal seizures are not random events and there are brain states associated with low or high probability of seizure occurrence, and that these states can be reliably classified using machine learning approaches (SVM & Universum-SVM) that combine features from iEEG, behavioral state tracking, and electrocardiogram (ECG) heart rate variability. The goal of this proposal is to develop reliable seizure forecasting (when possible) and improved understanding (data characterization) when good forecasting is not possible. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This grant proposes to develop the capability for accurate, reliable seizure forecasting using recent advances in support vector machines, data-analytic models, and Universum-SVM applied to continuous intracranial EEG canines with naturally occurring epilepsy.

"A Brain Atlas for Mapping Connectivity in Focal Epilepsy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Treatment of intractable focal epilepsy by resection of the seizure onset zone (SOZ) is often effective provided the SOZ can be reliably identified. Focal epilepsy, however, is fundamentally a network-based disease. The seizure onset zone is connected to a network whose other nodes may also exhibit abnormal neural activity either concurrently or subsequently. In patients without MRI detectable lesions, differentiation of the onset zone from these other nodes in the network can be difficult, even with the use of invasive recordings. The goal of this project is to improve SOZ identification, ultimately reducing the need for presurgical invasive recordings where possible, and guiding placement of electrodes in those patients who do need invasive monitoring. To achieve this goal, in Aim 1 we will build a functional connectivity atlas from a database of invasive Cortico-Cortical Evoked Potential (CCEP) recordings to identify common interaction networks in patients with partial epilepsy and to investigate the degree to which these are dependent on the location of the SOZ. To construct the atlas, patient data will be coregistered to a labelled anatomical atlas using a cortically constrained warping of each subject's structural MRI. In Aim 2, CCEPs data will be supplemented in the atlas with other data that provide additional insight into the brain regions involved in the seizure: regions of hypometabolism in interictal FDG PET, hypermetabolism in ictal SPECT, interictal spike localization from EEG and MEG and invasive recordings, functional areas associated with seizure semiology, MR-identified lesions, area of resection, post-surgical Engel classification. Using machine-learning methods, we will perform a sequence of tests to examine the degree to which the atlas can be used to identify the SOZ in individual subjects. Finally, in Aim 3, we will investigate the potential for using regional connectivity established frm noninvasive MEG data and resting state MRI in combination with the CCEPs atlas to identify these networks, with the ultimate goal of reducing the need for invasive monitoring. Retrospective analysis using a leave-one- out approach and comparison with outcomes will be used to quantify improvement in identification of the onset zone from both invasive and noninvasive recordings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Epilepsy affects millions of Americans, and for many, surgery is the best option to control their seizures. Improved surgical outcomes, however, requires a better understanding of the brain networks involved in seizure propagation. A brain atlas using data recorded from electrodes implanted in patients will yield new insights into pathways of the brain and will ultimately assist neurologists and neurosurgeons in better localizing and resecting the area of the brain that is causing seizures.",A Brain Atlas for Mapping Connectivity in Focal Epilepsy,9240674,R01NS089212,"['Affect ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomy ', ' Atlases ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Electrodes ', ' Implanted Electrodes ', ' EEG ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' epileptogenic ', ' epileptiform ', ' epilepsia ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' Epileptics ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Partial Seizure Disorder ', ' Localization-Related Epilepsy ', ' Focal Seizure Disorder ', ' Focal Epilepsy ', ' Partial Epilepsies ', ' Evoked Potentials ', ' Exhibits ', ' Goals ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Maps ', ' Patients ', ' Positron-Emission Tomography ', ' positron emitting tomography ', ' positron emission tomographic imaging ', ' positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging ', ' Rad.-PET ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Scan ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Medical Imaging ', ' PETT ', ' PETSCAN ', ' PET imaging ', ' PET Scan ', ' PET ', ' Rest ', ' Scalp structure ', ' Scalp ', ' Seizures ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Testing ', ' Single-Photon Emission-Computed Radionuclide Tomography ', ' SPECT imaging ', ' SPECT ', ' Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon ', ' computerized tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' catscan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' EMI scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' CT scan ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CAT scan ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' Measures ', ' Frontal Lobe Epilepsy ', ' density ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Lesion ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Neurologist ', ' neuro-surgeon ', ' Neurosurgeon ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' interest ', ' American ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' novel ', ' Categories ', ' Modality ', ' Excision ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' brain pathway ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ', ' fluorodeoxyglucose PET ', ' FDG PET ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Measurable ', ' Monitor ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' Implant ', ' Network-based ', ' public health relevance ', ' preimplantation ', ' pre-implantation ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' source localization ', ' ']",NINDS,CLEVELAND CLINIC LERNER COM-CWRU,R01,2017,531286,OH-11,0.3601742230529542
"Neurophysiology of Human Cortical Epilepsy ABSTRACT Epilepsy remains a devastating and poorly understood illness whose therapies are inadequate for many patients and, in large degree, unchanged for decades. The experiments proposed in this project utilize novel microelectrode recording techniques in patients with epilepsy as well as quantitative features and large data sets to obtain information about the neuronal dynamics underlying epilepsy at an unprecedented level of resolution. The primary hypothesis of this project is that this high resolution, multi-scale information can be applied to separate seizures into different classes which differ in the mechanisms which underlie seizure initiation. More specifically, we will be examining the role and interplay of widespread networks, different cortical layers, infraslow activity and both excitatory and inhibitory single neuronal activity as seizures start. We expect to find substantial differences in these different features of neural action in different kinds of seizures. This knowledge will foster the development of a more complete understanding of seizures and how they can be better detected, predicted and ultimately controlled.

"Towards automated phenotyping in epilepsy Over 5 million children and adults in the United States have had a diagnosis of epilepsy or a seizure disorder. However, treatment options for the epilepsies remain inadequate, because many patients suffer from uncontrolled seizures and from the negative side effects of treatment. A major obstacle to the faster development of new anti-convulsant therapies is the fact that rigorous preclinical epilepsy research typically requires labor-intensive and expensive 24/7 video-EEG monitoring of seizures that rests on the subjective scoring of seizure phenotypes by human observers (as exemplified by the widely used Racine scale of behavioral seizures). We propose to test if it is possible to perform objective, inexpensive and automated phenotyping of mice in various mouse models of acquired and genetic epilepsies. The approach rests on the recent recognition that mouse behaviors are structured in stereotyped modules at sub-second timescales that are arranged according to specific rules. These characteristic behavioral modules, and the transitions between them, can be identified without observer bias by combined 3D imaging and machine learning (ML) -assisted analytic methods. We propose to adopt this novel ML-assisted 3D video analysis technology to epilepsy research, in order to test if it can be used to identify mice with chronic temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) during inter-ictal and ictal periods in two distinct experimental TLE models, and under various experimental conditions. In addition, we will also test whether the approach is able to automatically detect not only the overtly epileptic mice in a genetic model of severe childhood epilepsy (homozygous voltage-gated sodium channel β-subunit SCN1B-/- knock-out mice), but also distinguish the seemingly normal, non-epileptic, SCN1B+/- heterozygous mice from the wild-type controls. We anticipate that these results will have a potentially transformative effect on the field by demonstrating the feasibility and power of automated, objective, user-independent, inexpensive analysis of acquired and genetic epilepsy phenotypes. There is an urgent need for new therapies for patients with uncontrolled epilepsy.

"Characterizing High Frequency Oscillations as an epilepsy biomarker with Big Data tools ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epilepsy is one of the world's most prevalent diseases, yet the rate of uncontrolled seizures has not changed in decades. One of the reasons for this is our limited understanding of seizure mechanisms, and so one of the main goals of epilepsy research is to identify new biomarkers to help us understand the nature of the disease. Recent technological advancements now allow us to monitor brain activity with much higher resolution, which have led to the identification of promising potential biomarkers such as High Frequency Oscillations (HFOs). Unfortunately, clinicians still have not determined how to utilize this information under clinical conditions. There are three main obstacles to implementing HFOs in practice: 1) it is unclear how to acquire them in a practical way; 2) it is unclear how to ascertain which HFOs are truly related to epilepsy; and 3) it is unclear how to use the HFO data in a prospective fashion to improve clinical care. The purpose of this project is overcome each of these obstacles. The first Aim validates a universal computer algorithm that can identify HFOs automatically, then tests how to use HFO rate as method to identify where seizures will start. This method improves upon past work by improving the precision of HFO detection and determining how to avoid false predictions that would lead to unnecessary surgery. The second Aim addresses a major unsolved problem in HFO research: HFOs are seen in normal brain as well as in epilepsy. This Aim will use state-of-the- art machine learning tools to process a vast dataset of HFO collected from over 100 patients to determine how to distinguish epileptic from normal HFOs. The third Aim will analyze how HFOs change over time, a largely unexplored characteristic of HFOs that cannot be evaluated without very large datasets. These Aims together serve as the framework to establish HFOs as a clinically viable biomarker of seizures, allowing their translation into clinical epilepsy care and leading to future prospective clinical studies identifying the location and timing of seizure onset. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to characterize a novel biomarker of seizures using advanced computer algorithms that monitor brainwaves in real time. These biomarkers, known as High Frequency Oscillations, have been recognized for some time but their research has been restricted to very short datasets within a handful of centers worldwide.

"Reliable Seizure Prediction Using Physiological Signals and Machine Learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For most individuals living with epilepsy, seizures are relatively infrequent events occupying a small fraction of their life. Despite spending as little a 0.01% of their lives having seizures (typically only minutes per month), people with epilepsy take anti-epileptic drugs (AED) daily, suffer AED related side effects, and spend their lives dreading when the next seizure will strike. The apparent randomness of seizures is associated with significant psychological consequences. In addition, despite daily AED approximately 1/3 of patients continue to have seizures. We hypothesize that epilepsy can be more effectively treated, both the seizures and their psychological impact, by providing patients with real-time seizure forecasting. Periods of low seizure probability would not require AEDs, or at least lower doses of AEDs, thus reducing AED exposure and their side effects. Periods of high seizure probability may respond to acute AED and patients could alter their activities to avoid injury. Patients would be empowered to manage their medications and life activities using reliable seizure forecasts. In this grant we investigate the hypothesis that seizures are predictable events, and pursue accurate, clinically relevant seizure forecasting using recent advances in support vector machines (SVM), data-analytic models, and Universum-SVM applied to continuous intracranial EEG (iEEG) in focal canine epilepsy. This is an initial step in establishin a new treatment paradigm for focal epilepsy, whereby the probability of seizure occurrence is continuously tracked for patient warning and intelligent responsive therapies. Naturally occurring focal canine epilepsy is an excellent model for investigation of seizure forecasting because of the clinical and electrophsyiological similarity to focal human epilepsy. This study provides a unique opportunity to study seizure forecasting in naturally occurring canine epilepsy under uniform conditions (the same environment). Importantly, dogs are large enough to accommodate devices designed for human use. The hypotheses driving this proposal are that focal seizures are not random events and there are brain states associated with low or high probability of seizure occurrence, and that these states can be reliably classified using machine learning approaches (SVM & Universum-SVM) that combine features from iEEG, behavioral state tracking, and electrocardiogram (ECG) heart rate variability. The goal of this proposal is to develop reliable seizure forecasting (when possible) and improved understanding (data characterization) when good forecasting is not possible.

"Seizure Prediction in a Rodent Model of Focal Epilepsy Project Summary/Abstract: Epilepsy is a debilitating neurological disease affecting 50 million people worldwide. While current management of epilepsy depends on continuous medication or invasive surgery, a deeper understanding of circuit-level pathology and an ability to predict seizures reliably will yield more focused therapeutic approaches. We will induce spontaneous unilateral focal seizures in rats by focal injection of kainic acid into the hippocampus. We will continuously record intracranial EEG, LFP, and video data from these rats for a period of 120 days. Relevant features will then be computed, including signal correlations, coherence, energy, entropies, and phase synchronization, as well as features detected by a sparse autoencoder. We will build train predictive classifiers using the first 90 days of data input to the following algorithms: (1) linear regression, (2) random forest, (3) support vector machines, and (4) neural networks. Performance will be assessed by ROC computed for the last 30 days of data. Next, we will apply single pulse electrical stimuli periodically to a new cohort of continuously monitored rats with unilateral hippocampal focal epilepsy. We will analyze the responses to this single pulse electrical stimulus on intracranial EEG and depth electrodes to determine whether seizures can be interrupted, predicted, then preempted by stimulus. Machine learning approaches coupled with active electrical stimulation will render algorithms that identify changes in the electrographic response to stimulus, which predict subsequent seizures with high sensitivity and specificity. We will leverage the fine spatiotemporal resolution offered by optogenetic techniques to study the nature of seizure initiation at the circuit level in a closed-loop system. We will probe the hippocampal circuit considered a generator in focal epilepsy: pyramidal neurons expressing CamK2a. To target each of these elements, we will induce expression of a halorhodopsin driven by the CamK2a promoter via a lentivirus delivered stereotactically to the hippocampal CA3. We will then stimulate the halorhodopsin with 589 nm light pulses, delivered during pre-ictal activity identified by the predictive algorithms and stimulus response. This closed-loop system will be uniquely informative by altering brain states preemptively rather than during the actual seizure as done in previous studies. Our study will ultimately offer new insights into the mechanisms underlying seizure initiation, and may help improve diagnostics and therapeutic approaches for patients suffering from focal epilepsy. Project Narrative: In a rat model of epilepsy, we will study the patterns of brain electrical activity in response to electrical stimulus, and how those patterns change in distinct brain states including: seizure, immediately before seizure, and between seizures. We will use statistical and computational approaches to predict seizures, and subsequently preempt the predicted seizures using stimulus that targets the seizure-generating circuit in the brain.

"Neurophysiology of Human Cortical Epilepsy ABSTRACT Epilepsy remains a devastating and poorly understood illness whose therapies are inadequate for many patients and, in large degree, unchanged for decades. The experiments proposed in this project utilize novel microelectrode recording techniques in patients with epilepsy as well as quantitative features and large data sets to obtain information about the neuronal dynamics underlying epilepsy at an unprecedented level of resolution. The primary hypothesis of this project is that this high resolution, multi-scale information can be applied to separate seizures into different classes which differ in the mechanisms which underlie seizure initiation. More specifically, we will be examining the role and interplay of widespread networks, different cortical layers, infraslow activity and both excitatory and inhibitory single neuronal activity as seizures start. We expect to find substantial differences in these different features of neural action in different kinds of seizures. This knowledge will foster the development of a more complete understanding of seizures and how they can be better detected, predicted and ultimately controlled.

"Exploring thalamocortical neural state space for adaptive closed-loop deep brain stimulation of epileptic networks. Despite the high prevalence of epilepsy, which affects nearly 4% of the population over their lifetime, roughly one third of afflicted patients are incompletely responsive to anticonvulsant drugs, requiring in severe cases neurosurgical resections or novel approaches such as deep-brain stimulation (DBS). Recently, I helped develop an electrophysiology-based online DBS protocol for seizure detection and interruption in rodent models of absence epilepsy, a form of epilepsy involving aberrant thalamocortical activity. However, like other online DBS procedures which detect seizures as they occur, there was little ability to predict incipient seizures due in large part to limited spatiotemporal resolution of the signal we used, the electrocorticogram (ECoG). ECoG and related electroencephalogram (EEG), being large scale local field potential approaches, do not provide single-cell resolution of neural dynamics that are likely required to obtain predictive information. Over the last decade, the field of brain-machine interface (BMI) has made breakthroughs in neuroscience and engineering by developing methods for multi-electrode array recording of large scale neural spiking activity and efficient reduction of the resultant high-dimensional neural activity to a smaller number of dimensions to effectively control neural prostheses. We predict that this approach will be invaluable for understanding neural dynamics during seizures and stimulation, and for developing predictive algorithms and adaptive DBS protocols.  Therefore, the goal of this project is to precisely characterize thalamocortical neural activity during spontaneous absence seizures and following thalamic stimulation by combining large-scale thalamic and cortical neural recordings, optogenetics, and BMI mathematical techniques. Additionally, the experiments presented in this proposal will use the recorded neural activity to develop adaptive algorithms that both predict oncoming seizure activity and modify stimulation parameters based on the neural state and response to stimulation in real-time. This proposal is aimed towards increasing our understanding of the neural dynamics of epileptic networks and improving the efficacy and safety of online DBS. Roughly one third of epileptic patients are resistant to pharmacological treatment, which has promoted the development of deep brain stimulation (DBS) as a means to detect and prevent seizures. However, the neural activity underlying epileptic discharges and the effects of DBS on this activity are poorly understood, partially due to the limited information carried by the EEG signals used for monitoring seizures. A more precise characterization of epileptic neural circuits is crucial to improve current DBS design and enhance the sensitivity and efficacy of seizure detection and disruption, which demands the tools and resources of basic research.",Exploring thalamocortical neural state space for adaptive closed-loop deep brain stimulation of epileptic networks.,9408441,F31NS100265,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anticonvulsants ', ' Anticonvulsive Drugs ', ' Anticonvulsive Agents ', ' Anticonvulsant Drugs ', ' Anticonvulsant Agent ', ' Awareness ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Electrodes ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Engineering ', ' Epilepsy ', ' epileptogenic ', ' epileptiform ', ' epilepsia ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' Epileptics ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Absence Epilepsy ', ' petit mal seizure ', ' Pyknolepsy ', ' Pykno-Epilepsy ', ' Petit Mal Epilepsy ', ' Petit Mal Convulsion ', ' Minor Epilepsy ', ' Juvenile Absence Epilepsy ', ' Childhood Absence Epilepsy ', ' Absence Seizures ', ' Absence Seizure Disorder ', ' Exhibits ', ' Goals ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Methods ', ' Motor Cortex ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Neurons ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Patients ', ' Primates ', ' Primates Mammals ', ' Rattus ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Rat ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Rodentia ', ' Safety ', ' Seizures ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' thalamic ', ' Thalamus ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Refractory ', ' insight ', ' Generalized seizures ', ' Individual ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Deep Brain Stimulation ', ' Principal Component Analysis ', ' Principal Component Analyses ', ' Electrocorticogram ', ' electrocorticography ', ' Dimensions ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' neural prosthesis ', ' neural prosthetic ', ' neuroregulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neural regulation ', ' neural control ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Sorting - Cell Movement ', ' sorting ', ' Appearance ', ' Excision ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' neural circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Detection ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Interruption ', ' Resolution ', ' Pharmacological Treatment ', ' Rodent Model ', ' Monitor ', ' Preparation ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Electroencephalogram ', ' Output ', ' markov model ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' brain machine interface ', ' Population ', ' resistant ', ' Resistance ', ' Implant ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' optogenetics ', ' multielectrode arrays ', ' multi-electrode arrays ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' high dimensionality ', ' ']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F31,2018,38516,CA-18,0.32645874612668363
"Dynamics of long range network interactions  in focal epilepsy PROJECT SUMMARY Epilepsy is the world’s most prominent serious brain disorder, affecting nearly 50 million people worldwide. For about 30% of these patients, seizures remain poorly controlled despite optimal medical management, with attendant effects on health and quality of life. In order to enable advances in the therapeutic management of epilepsy, a thorough understanding of how cellular processes that drive seizures are linked to large-scale network effects is needed. While seizures impact large brain areas and often multiple lobes, the driving processes span regions on the scale of millimeters. These have been well characterized in animal models, but the relevance to human seizures, i.e. how seizures are driven by brain signals from small-scale processes remains unclear. Instead, the view that naturally-occurring seizures may be attributable instead to large-scale neural mass effects (i.e., the epileptic network) is a subject of ongoing debate. Previously, we defined a key role for surround inhibition in shaping EEG recordings of seizures at the onset site and on small spatial scales. We now propose that surround inhibition has a dual role. On a millimeter scale, its abrupt failure permits the advance of a seizure. At long distances from the seizure focus, strong local inhibition serves to mask the excitatory effects of seizures and may help to hasten seizure termination, while weakened inhibition may permit emergence of ictal activity at a distant, noncontiguous seizure site. Multiple seizure foci may go unrecognized with standard EEG interpretation methods, and are likely a critical factor in epilepsy surgery failures. We hypothesize that once established, multiple ictal generators behave as delay-coupled oscillators, demonstrating activity that is synchronized or even temporally reversed. This results in complex and at times counterintuitive network behavior that can be challenging to reverse engineer from EEG recordings. Typically, however, even intracranial EEG recordings provide only a limited view of neural activity. In this project, an interdisciplinary research group with combined expertise in epilepsy, clinical neurophysiology, computational modeling, and mathematics will conduct a comprehensive study of the neuronal contributors to epileptic networks utilizing a unique combined dataset of simultaneous microelectrode and macroelectrode recordings of human seizures. Using a machine learning approach, we will apply this information to develop a multivariate EEG biomarker based on the inferred source of EEG discharges, high frequency oscillations, and very low frequency (DC) shifts and assess its predictive value for post-resection surgical outcome. We anticipate that the project will lead to a theoretical framework for rational development of innovative strategies for developing interventions to control seizures. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project aims to identify the cellular mechanisms of epileptic networks, a critical barrier to developing treatments based on epileptic network analysis and manipulation. An interdisciplinary team of researchers will address this problem by analyzing and modeling multiscale voltage data from epilepsy patients, and utilizing the results to develop a new multivariate biomarker for seizure-generating brain areas.",Dynamics of long range network interactions  in focal epilepsy,9687085,R01NS084142,"['Affect ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Biophysics ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Decision Making ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Engineering ', ' Epilepsy ', ' epileptogenic ', ' epileptiform ', ' epilepsia ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' Epileptics ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Partial Epilepsies ', ' Partial Seizure Disorder ', ' Localization-Related Epilepsy ', ' Focal Seizure Disorder ', ' Focal Epilepsy ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' High Frequency Oscillation ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' In Vitro ', ' Incidence ', ' Masks ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Methods ', ' Microelectrodes ', ' Miniaturized Electrodes ', ' Study models ', ' Neurons ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Terminology ', ' Patients ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Seizures ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' Universities ', ' Weight ', ' Generations ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Failure ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Shapes ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' millimeter ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Distant ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' voltage ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Excision ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' Impact Seizures ', ' Focal Seizure ', ' partial seizure ', ' Lobe ', ' lobes ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Collection ', ' Pathologic ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' multiscale modeling ', ' multi-scale modeling ', ' Coupled ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' parallel computing ', ' parallel computation ', ' parallel computer ', ' minimally invasive ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' surgical outcome ', ' surgery outcome ', ' ']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2018,689291,NY-13,0.4294919733288242
"A Brain Atlas for Mapping Connectivity in Focal Epilepsy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Treatment of intractable focal epilepsy by resection of the seizure onset zone (SOZ) is often effective provided the SOZ can be reliably identified. Focal epilepsy, however, is fundamentally a network-based disease. The seizure onset zone is connected to a network whose other nodes may also exhibit abnormal neural activity either concurrently or subsequently. In patients without MRI detectable lesions, differentiation of the onset zone from these other nodes in the network can be difficult, even with the use of invasive recordings. The goal of this project is to improve SOZ identification, ultimately reducing the need for presurgical invasive recordings where possible, and guiding placement of electrodes in those patients who do need invasive monitoring. To achieve this goal, in Aim 1 we will build a functional connectivity atlas from a database of invasive Cortico-Cortical Evoked Potential (CCEP) recordings to identify common interaction networks in patients with partial epilepsy and to investigate the degree to which these are dependent on the location of the SOZ. To construct the atlas, patient data will be coregistered to a labelled anatomical atlas using a cortically constrained warping of each subject's structural MRI. In Aim 2, CCEPs data will be supplemented in the atlas with other data that provide additional insight into the brain regions involved in the seizure: regions of hypometabolism in interictal FDG PET, hypermetabolism in ictal SPECT, interictal spike localization from EEG and MEG and invasive recordings, functional areas associated with seizure semiology, MR-identified lesions, area of resection, post-surgical Engel classification. Using machine-learning methods, we will perform a sequence of tests to examine the degree to which the atlas can be used to identify the SOZ in individual subjects. Finally, in Aim 3, we will investigate the potential for using regional connectivity established frm noninvasive MEG data and resting state MRI in combination with the CCEPs atlas to identify these networks, with the ultimate goal of reducing the need for invasive monitoring. Retrospective analysis using a leave-one- out approach and comparison with outcomes will be used to quantify improvement in identification of the onset zone from both invasive and noninvasive recordings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Epilepsy affects millions of Americans, and for many, surgery is the best option to control their seizures. Improved surgical outcomes, however, requires a better understanding of the brain networks involved in seizure propagation. A brain atlas using data recorded from electrodes implanted in patients will yield new insights into pathways of the brain and will ultimately assist neurologists and neurosurgeons in better localizing and resecting the area of the brain that is causing seizures.",A Brain Atlas for Mapping Connectivity in Focal Epilepsy,9442865,R01NS089212,"['Affect ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Atlases ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electrodes ', ' Implanted Electrodes ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Epilepsy ', ' epileptogenic ', ' epileptiform ', ' epilepsia ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' Epileptics ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Partial Epilepsies ', ' Partial Seizure Disorder ', ' Localization-Related Epilepsy ', ' Focal Seizure Disorder ', ' Focal Epilepsy ', ' Evoked Potentials ', ' Exhibits ', ' Goals ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Maps ', ' Patients ', ' Positron-Emission Tomography ', ' positron emitting tomography ', ' positron emission tomographic imaging ', ' positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging ', ' Rad.-PET ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Scan ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Medical Imaging ', ' PETT ', ' PETSCAN ', ' PET imaging ', ' PET Scan ', ' PET ', ' Rest ', ' Scalp structure ', ' Scalp ', ' Seizures ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Testing ', ' single photon emission computed tomography ', ' Single-Photon Emission-Computed Radionuclide Tomography ', ' SPECT imaging ', ' SPECT ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' computerized tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' catscan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' EMI scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' CT scan ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CAT scan ', ' Measures ', ' Frontal Lobe Epilepsy ', ' density ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Lesion ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Neurologist ', ' neuro-surgeon ', ' Neurosurgeon ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' interest ', ' American ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' novel ', ' Categories ', ' Modality ', ' Excision ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' brain pathway ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ', ' fluorodeoxyglucose PET ', ' FDG PET ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Measurable ', ' Monitor ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' Implant ', ' Network-based ', ' public health relevance ', ' pre-implantation ', ' preimplantation ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' source localization ', ' surgical outcome ', ' surgery outcome ', ' ']",NINDS,CLEVELAND CLINIC LERNER COM-CWRU,R01,2018,531286,OH-11,0.3601742230529542
"Distributed networks underlying depression in epilepsy: a computational circuit-based approach to biomarker development PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Adult patients with epilepsy have an increased prevalence of major depression and other psychiatric co- morbidities. Depression in epilepsy is associated with worse outcome and quality of life. However, it continues to be underdiagnosed and untreated and further attention to this comorbidity is critical. My career goal is to become an academic neuroscientist and clinician focused on understanding the neural networks underlying co- morbid mood and anxiety spectrum disorders in patients with epilepsy.  Specific brain circuits may underlie depression and be commonly affected by different precipitants (i.e. stress, inflammation, epilepsy). In this proposal, our model is that a set of neural features across these brain circuits will be shared across many patients with co-morbid depression. Evidence for a strong relationship between epilepsy and depression includes the presence of depression symptoms before, during, after, and in between seizures, evidence of cases of concurrent onset of depression and epilepsy, an increased incidence of interictal depression when limbic structures are involved in seizure occurrence, and evidence that depression scores may be lower after surgical resection for medication refractory epilepsy. Intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) captured during the pre-surgical recording period offers a particularly promising method to study depression networks in adult epilepsy, offering both high temporal resolution and spatial precision. Despite the enormous potential of iEEG, there are no studies to date that examine the neurophysiological signatures of network dysfunction in mood and anxiety disorders in patients with epilepsy. Such studies are critical in order to better understand the etiology of co-morbid depression and could lead to novel personalized therapies.  In our pilot work, we identify a set of power spectral measures within a corticolimbic circuit that appear to be linked to depression and are, therefore, a potential biomarker of co-morbid depression. We also found evidence that supports the basis for testing whether neural features will predict treatment outcome. This proposal builds on these preliminary findings to validate our model and test the hypothesis that a set of neural features is shared across some subjects with MDD in epilepsy and is detectable with machine-learning techniques applied to interictal iEEG recordings. Aim 1 demonstrates the relationship between resting state neural circuit abnormality and depression. Aim 2 tests whether removing the dysfunctional region of the circuit improves depression and whether the presurgical resting state iEEG predicts that improvement.  To address these research goals, I will need more rigorous training in computational neuroscience for complex datasets, advanced signal processing, and biostatistics. My training plan and carefully selected mentoring and advisory team across fields of psychiatry, neurosurgery, neurology and statistics will allow me to obtain the necessary experiences to become a fully independent investigator who brings the tools of computational approaches to the service of mental health research and novel personalized treatment paradigms in epilepsy. PROJECT NARRATIVE Psychiatric co-morbidities in epilepsy are common, undertreated, and poorly understood. Using intracranial recordings in patients who will undergo epilepsy surgery for medication-refractory disease, we propose to test a model that a set of neural features is shared across subjects with depression in epilepsy.

"MR Fingerprinting for Epilepsy Abstract Epilepsy affects 65 million people worldwide; approximately 30% of them do not respond to medications but can be cured by surgery. Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD), a major pathology for medically intractable epilepsies, is frequently missed by visual analysis of the conventional MRI, making surgical treatment very difficult. We propose to develop a novel quantitative MRI acquisition and analysis framework specific for epilepsy patients, which could provide more sensitive and specific measures of brain structure, thereby improving FCD detection and subtype prediction. To this end, the quantitative framework will be developed and validated in three steps: (1) Develop high-resolution Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) scan that allows simultaneous quantification of multiple tissue property maps efficiently, accurately and precisely. These quantitative maps have shown to be more sensitive and specific on detecting and characterizing subtle signal abnormalities. (2) Develop image post-processing methods to analyze quantitative maps, which will provide quantitative measurements that highlight additional morphological features, such as gray-white boundary blurring, abnormal cortical thickness and folding. (3) Develop machine-learning-based feature screening and prediction tools to characterize group-level features differentiating FCD subtypes, and predict individual-level FCD location and subtyping. Because detection and subtype prediction of FCD are both associated with seizure outcomes, epileptologists can use this tool to provide more personalized and customized counseling. The result of our proposed work promises a paradigm shift by converting the current standard-care of visual/qualitative MRI review to a quantitative framework, including data acquisition, post-processing and decision support tool, that would eventually lead to better treatment planning, reduction in unnecessary pre-surgical evaluation tests (especially invasive evaluation), and improved post-operative seizure outcomes in patients with devastating and disabling medically intractable epilepsy. The quantitative nature of our acquisition/analysis methods also makes it possible to be uniformly adopted by other centers with high consistency.

"Automated Phenotyping in Epilepsy There are 65 million people worldwide with epilepsy and 150,000 new cases of epilepsy are diagnosed in the US annually. However, treatment options for epilepsy remain inadequate, with many patients suffering from treatment-resistant seizures, cognitive comorbidities and the negative side effects of treatment. A major obstacle to progress towards the development of new therapies is the fact that preclinical epilepsy research typically requires labor-intensive and expensive 24/7 video-EEG monitoring of seizures that rests on the subjective scoring of seizure phenotypes by human observers (as exemplified by the widely used Racine scale of behavioral seizures). Recently, the Datta lab showed that complex animal behaviors are structured in stereotyped modules (“syllables”) at sub-second timescales and arranged according to specific rules (“grammar”). These syllables can be detected without observer bias using a method called motion sequencing (MoSeq) that employs video imaging with a 3D camera combined with artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted video analysis to characterize behavior. Through collaboration between the Soltesz and Datta labs, exciting data were obtained that demonstrated that MoSeq can be adapted for epilepsy research to perform objective, inexpensive and automated phenotyping of mice in a mouse model of chronic temporal lobe epilepsy. Here we propose to test and improve MoSeq further to address long-standing, fundamental challenges in epilepsy research. This includes the development of an objective alternative to the Racine scale, testing of MoSeq as an automated anti-epileptic drug (AED) screening method, and the development of human observer- independent behavioral biomarkers for seizures, epileptogenesis, and cognitive comorbidities. In addition, we plan to dramatically extend the epilepsy-related capabilities of MoSeq to include the automated tracking of finer-scale body parts (e.g., forelimb and facial clonus) that are not possible with the current approach. Finally, we propose to develop the analysis pipeline for MoSeq into a form that is intuitive, inexpensive, user-friendly and thus easily sharable with the research community. We anticipate that these results will have a potentially transformative effect on the field by demonstrating the feasibility and power of automated, objective, user- independent, inexpensive analysis of both acquired and genetic epilepsy phenotypes. There is an urgent need for new therapies for patients with uncontrolled epilepsy. The project will develop breakthrough technologies involving artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted analysis of 3-dimensional video data of mouse behavior to address long-standing, fundamental challenges in preclinical epilepsy research. If successful, this innovative approach is expected to have a significant and sustained impact on epilepsy research by enabling investigators to perform objective, automated, inexpensive, reproducible assessment of epilepsy in experimental animals to aid the testing of anti-seizure drugs and other novel therapies.",Automated Phenotyping in Epilepsy,9862231,R01NS114020,"['Animals ', ' Antiepileptic Agents ', ' anti-epileptic drugs ', ' anti-epileptic agents ', ' Antiepileptics ', ' Antiepileptic Drugs ', ' Anti-epileptic ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Behavior ', ' Animal Behavior ', ' Cannabidiol ', ' Carbamazepine ', ' Tegretol ', ' Epitol ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Clonazepam ', ' Clonus ', ' Communities ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Diagnosis ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' EEG ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' epileptogenic ', ' epileptiform ', ' epilepsia ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' Epileptics ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Temporal Lobe Epilepsy ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Forelimb ', ' Future ', ' Head ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hippocampus ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Methods ', ' Genetic Models ', ' Motion ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' Observer Bias ', ' Observer Variation ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Fenitoin ', ' Diphenylhydantoin ', ' Dilantin ', ' Phenytoin ', ' Pilocarpine ', ' Probability ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Rest ', ' Seizures ', ' Specificity ', ' Stereotyping ', ' Tail ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Divalproex ', ' Depakote ER ', ' Depakote ', ' Valproic Acid ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' base ', ' method development ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' kainate ', ' Body part ', ' Intuition ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' Complex ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' 3D ', ' 3-D ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' Structure ', ' behavior test ', ' behavioral test ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Resolution ', ' Cognitive ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' Epileptogenesis ', ' Three-dimensional analysis ', ' 3D analysis ', ' 3-dimensional analysis ', ' 3-D analysis ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' pre-clinical research ', ' preclinical research ', ' user-friendly ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new drugs ', ' new drug treatments ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' selective expression ', ' selectively expressed ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' drug use screening ', ' optogenetics ', ' Drug Screening ', ' analysis pipeline ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' ']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,450365,CA-18,0.3487430959803734
"Assessment of Peripherally Circulating Plasma Proteins and Clinical Risks to Differentiate Epileptic Seizure from Psychogenic Nonepileptic Seizure Project Summary / Abstract Accurately diagnosing epilepsy is very challenging and time consuming because clinicians rarely observe the actual seizure, and there are many different types of seizures and epilepsy syndromes with differing presentations. Furthermore, other neurological disorders can be mimics of seizures leading to erroneous diagnosis, inappropriate treatments with significant potential adverse events, incorrect prognoses, and significant waste of healthcare resources. A primary indication that is mistaken for epilepsy is psychogenic non-epileptic seizure (PNES) which is commonly misdiagnosed even by seasoned clinicians. Patients that suffer PNES events experience convulsive events which are similar to epileptic seizures but do not arise from aberrant, synchronous, electrical activity in the brain. Rendering a definitive diagnosis of either PNES or epilepsy is critical to long-term patient health and outcome. In many cases, patients suffering PNES events are prescribed anti-epilepsy drugs (AEDs) and suffer unnecessary side effects. Alternatively, patients that are suspected to suffer PNES, but actually have epilepsy and are not treated with AEDs, are at risk of experiencing seizures and even sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Currently, obtaining a definitive diagnosis of epilepsy or PNES is expensive and inconvenient for patients as it may require inpatient evaluation and a battery of costly tests. Thus, a critical gap in our clinical assessment of seizures, be it epileptic or psychogenic, is an accurate diagnostic blood test that can be used to stratify transient neurological events as either PNES or epilepsy. Towards developing this test, Evogen has developed an innovative informatic approach that incorporates all available clinical information and our protein biomarker approach to detect seizure using an artificial intelligence approach of machine learning. To confirm our previous results, Evogen proposes an epilepsy monitoring unit-based all-comers study which will collect both blood samples and clinical information from patients’ ES and PNES events. Protein biomarker concentrations will be determined and combined with clinical information using a machine learning approach to create a diagnostic algorithm that will provide a probabilistic score that a patient experienced an ES or PNES event. The test will have a profound impact on diagnosis and treatment of both ES and PNES. We believe this test will have an immediate impact on identifying which patients require EMU evaluation. Typically, one third of patients that visit the EMU for a definitive diagnosis suffer from PNES events and represent a large burden to the tertiary epilepsy centers. When patients are referred for EMU monitoring, they are sequentially put on a waiting list and infrequently is any triage used. Therefore, a test that can aid in routing patients with psychogenic events to the appropriate care will increase the accessibility for patients with a high probability of epilepsy. The work proposed here is the first step necessary to confirm pilot results. Upon confirmation, a streamlined development plan has been created to collect all of the information required for CLIA accreditation and bring the test to market. Project Narrative Differentiating epileptic seizures from psychogenic nonepileptic seizure is a substantially unmet medical need. Current tools to differentiate between epileptic seizures and psychogenic nonepileptic seizures have limited performance, high costs and limited availability. A diagnostic test that indicates if a patient recently experienced an epileptic seizure or psychogenic event would provide physicians with objective, actionable data that can result in improved clinical care, patient outcomes and healthcare system savings.",Assessment of Peripherally Circulating Plasma Proteins and Clinical Risks to Differentiate Epileptic Seizure from Psychogenic Nonepileptic Seizure,9846171,R43NS113724,"['Adoption ', ' Algorithms ', ' Antiepileptic Agents ', ' anti-epileptic drugs ', ' anti-epileptic agents ', ' Antiepileptics ', ' Antiepileptic Drugs ', ' Anti-epileptic ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Confidence Intervals ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' EEG ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' ELISA ', ' Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay ', ' epileptogenic ', ' epileptiform ', ' epilepsia ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' Epileptics ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Hematology Testing ', ' Hematological Tests ', ' Hematologic Tests ', ' Blood Tests ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Inflammation ', ' Inpatients ', ' Laboratories ', ' Methodology ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Patients ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Physicians ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Plasma Proteins ', ' Probability ', ' Production ', ' Proteins ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Running ', ' Savings ', ' Seasons ', ' Seizures ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Specificity ', ' statistics ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Triage ', ' Universities ', ' waitlist ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' Work ', ' ICAM-1 ', ' CD54 Antigens ', ' Intercellular adhesion molecule 1 ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Blood Sample ', ' improved ', ' Peripheral ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Evaluation ', ' wasting ', ' Development Plans ', ' Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' Route ', ' Visit ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' Informatics ', ' validation studies ', ' TNF gene ', ' Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha ', ' Tumor Necrosis Factor ', ' TNFα ', ' TNFA ', ' TNF-α ', ' TNF Alpha ', ' TNF A ', ' TNF ', ' Monocyte-Derived TNF ', ' Macrophage-Derived TNF ', ' Cachectin ', ' (TNF)-α ', ' Sampling ', ' Proteomics ', ' Adverse event ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' CCL8 gene ', ' SCYA8 ', ' SCYA10 ', ' MCP2 ', ' MCP-2 ', ' HC14 ', ' CCL8 ', ' TNFSF10 gene ', ' TRAIL ', ' TNFSF10 ', ' TL2 ', ' Apo-2L ', ' APO2L ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' research clinical testing ', ' clinical test ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' prototype ', ' clinical care ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' clinical risk ', ' accurate diagnosis ', ' Industry Standard ', ' protein biomarkers ', ' protein markers ', ' CLIA certified ', ' CLIA licensed ', ' CLIA compliant ', ' CLIA approved ', ' CLIA accredited ', ' side effect ', ' ']",NINDS,"EVOGEN, INC.",R43,2019,562119,PA-03,0.47103837743860816
"Neurophysiology of Human Cortical Epilepsy ABSTRACT Epilepsy remains a devastating and poorly understood illness whose therapies are inadequate for many patients and, in large degree, unchanged for decades. The experiments proposed in this project utilize novel microelectrode recording techniques in patients with epilepsy as well as quantitative features and large data sets to obtain information about the neuronal dynamics underlying epilepsy at an unprecedented level of resolution. The primary hypothesis of this project is that this high resolution, multi-scale information can be applied to separate seizures into different classes which differ in the mechanisms which underlie seizure initiation. More specifically, we will be examining the role and interplay of widespread networks, different cortical layers, infraslow activity and both excitatory and inhibitory single neuronal activity as seizures start. We expect to find substantial differences in these different features of neural action in different kinds of seizures. This knowledge will foster the development of a more complete understanding of seizures and how they can be better detected, predicted and ultimately controlled.

"Dynamics of long range network interactions  in focal epilepsy PROJECT SUMMARY Epilepsy is the world’s most prominent serious brain disorder, affecting nearly 50 million people worldwide. For about 30% of these patients, seizures remain poorly controlled despite optimal medical management, with attendant effects on health and quality of life. In order to enable advances in the therapeutic management of epilepsy, a thorough understanding of how cellular processes that drive seizures are linked to large-scale network effects is needed. While seizures impact large brain areas and often multiple lobes, the driving processes span regions on the scale of millimeters. These have been well characterized in animal models, but the relevance to human seizures, i.e. how seizures are driven by brain signals from small-scale processes remains unclear. Instead, the view that naturally-occurring seizures may be attributable instead to large-scale neural mass effects (i.e., the epileptic network) is a subject of ongoing debate. Previously, we defined a key role for surround inhibition in shaping EEG recordings of seizures at the onset site and on small spatial scales. We now propose that surround inhibition has a dual role. On a millimeter scale, its abrupt failure permits the advance of a seizure. At long distances from the seizure focus, strong local inhibition serves to mask the excitatory effects of seizures and may help to hasten seizure termination, while weakened inhibition may permit emergence of ictal activity at a distant, noncontiguous seizure site. Multiple seizure foci may go unrecognized with standard EEG interpretation methods, and are likely a critical factor in epilepsy surgery failures. We hypothesize that once established, multiple ictal generators behave as delay-coupled oscillators, demonstrating activity that is synchronized or even temporally reversed. This results in complex and at times counterintuitive network behavior that can be challenging to reverse engineer from EEG recordings. Typically, however, even intracranial EEG recordings provide only a limited view of neural activity. In this project, an interdisciplinary research group with combined expertise in epilepsy, clinical neurophysiology, computational modeling, and mathematics will conduct a comprehensive study of the neuronal contributors to epileptic networks utilizing a unique combined dataset of simultaneous microelectrode and macroelectrode recordings of human seizures. Using a machine learning approach, we will apply this information to develop a multivariate EEG biomarker based on the inferred source of EEG discharges, high frequency oscillations, and very low frequency (DC) shifts and assess its predictive value for post-resection surgical outcome. We anticipate that the project will lead to a theoretical framework for rational development of innovative strategies for developing interventions to control seizures. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project aims to identify the cellular mechanisms of epileptic networks, a critical barrier to developing treatments based on epileptic network analysis and manipulation. An interdisciplinary team of researchers will address this problem by analyzing and modeling multiscale voltage data from epilepsy patients, and utilizing the results to develop a new multivariate biomarker for seizure-generating brain areas.",Dynamics of long range network interactions  in focal epilepsy,9792276,R01NS084142,"['Affect ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Biophysics ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Decision Making ', ' EEG ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Engineering ', ' epileptogenic ', ' epileptiform ', ' epilepsia ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' Epileptics ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Partial Seizure Disorder ', ' Localization-Related Epilepsy ', ' Focal Seizure Disorder ', ' Focal Epilepsy ', ' Partial Epilepsies ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' High Frequency Oscillation ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' In Vitro ', ' Incidence ', ' Masks ', ' Math ', ' Mathematics ', ' Methods ', ' Miniaturized Electrodes ', ' Microelectrodes ', ' Study models ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' neurophysiological ', ' neurophysiology ', ' Terminology ', ' Patients ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Seizures ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' Universities ', ' Weight ', ' Generations ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Failure ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Shapes ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' millimeter ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Distant ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' voltage ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Excision ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' Impact Seizures ', ' Focal Seizure ', ' partial seizure ', ' Lobe ', ' lobes ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Collection ', ' Pathologic ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' multi-scale modeling ', ' multiscale modeling ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' parallel computer ', ' parallel computing ', ' parallel computation ', ' minimally invasive ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' surgery outcome ', ' surgical outcome ', ' ']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,613085,NY-13,0.4294919733288242
"Prediction of seizure lateralization and postoperative outcome through the use of deep learning applied to multi-site MRI/DTI data:  An ENIGMA-Epilepsy study ABSTRACT  Epilepsy is a devastating neurological illness that affects 65 million people worldwide. Approximately one-third of patients affected do not respond to antiepileptic drug therapy and require a thorough diagnostic work-up. Structural neuroimaging plays a pivotal role in the diagnostic evaluation of patients with focal epilepsy, identifying visible lesions in many patients that often coincide with the seizure focus. However, 20- 40% of patients have normal-appearing MRIs and this number appears to be growing. As a result, there is increased interest in identifying subtle gray and white matter network changes on non-invasive, quantitative MRI, including structural MRI (sMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), that can help to delineate the epileptogenic network. Unfortunately, methods for selecting optimal features from sMRI/DTI data in patients with epilepsy that can address these clinical challenges have not been developed. There are at least two major barriers that have limited progress in this field. First, sample sizes have been insufficient to develop reliable classification algorithms in patients with focal epilepsy that lead to reproducible findings. The high cost of data collection - few studies scan more than 50-60 patients - has led to underpowered studies whose findings often fail to replicate and cannot adequately model confounds. Second, high computational demands have previously limited the feasibility of using sophisticated, feature-selection (i.e., Machine Learning; ML) algorithms in clinical settings.  A new, large-scale data initiative (i.e., ENIGMA-epilepsy) acquired from 24 sites world-wide is now lifting these barriers and allowing for the development and validation of innovative data-driven approaches aimed at optimizing the use of MRI data in the evaluation of epilepsy. In this grant, we will leverage data collected through ENIGMA-Epilepsy—a new, cost-effective, innovative global approach that unblocks the power logjam by merging resources, data, capital infrastructure and talents of leading epilepsy centers from 14 countries across the world (2,149 patient and 1,727 healthy control MRI/DTI datasets). We will also leverage new developments in ML (i.e., deep learning) and network-based modeling (i.e., connectome- based approaches) and test whether these novel approaches improve upon classification accuracy relative to simpler, user-driven models. Our primary aim will be to test the ability of our deep learning approach (i.e., dense neural networks) to lateralize the seizure focus. In an exploratory aim, we will test the ability of our model to predict post-operative seizure outcomes. ENIGMA's harmonized approach will allow us to test our approach in over 24 datasets, diverse in age, ethnicity, age of onset, epilepsy duration, and surgical outcomes.  This R-21 application addresses NIH's call for more reproducible studies by introducing a highly- powered design, and is directly aligned with NINDS's 2014 Epilepsy Benchmarks, which encourage the identification of biomarkers for assessing or predicting treatment response in patients with epilepsy. NARRATIVE Epilepsy is a devastating neurological illness, affecting 65 million people worldwide.

"Reliable Seizure Prediction Using Physiological Signals and Machine Learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For most individuals living with epilepsy, seizures are relatively infrequent events occupying a small fraction of their life. Despite spending as little a 0.01% of their lives having seizures (typically only minutes per month), people with epilepsy take anti-epileptic drugs (AED) daily, suffer AED related side effects, and spend their lives dreading when the next seizure will strike. The apparent randomness of seizures is associated with significant psychological consequences. In addition, despite daily AED approximately 1/3 of patients continue to have seizures. We hypothesize that epilepsy can be more effectively treated, both the seizures and their psychological impact, by providing patients with real-time seizure forecasting. Periods of low seizure probability would not require AEDs, or at least lower doses of AEDs, thus reducing AED exposure and their side effects. Periods of high seizure probability may respond to acute AED and patients could alter their activities to avoid injury. Patients would be empowered to manage their medications and life activities using reliable seizure forecasts. In this grant we investigate the hypothesis that seizures are predictable events, and pursue accurate, clinically relevant seizure forecasting using recent advances in support vector machines (SVM), data-analytic models, and Universum-SVM applied to continuous intracranial EEG (iEEG) in focal canine epilepsy. This is an initial step in establishin a new treatment paradigm for focal epilepsy, whereby the probability of seizure occurrence is continuously tracked for patient warning and intelligent responsive therapies. Naturally occurring focal canine epilepsy is an excellent model for investigation of seizure forecasting because of the clinical and electrophsyiological similarity to focal human epilepsy. This study provides a unique opportunity to study seizure forecasting in naturally occurring canine epilepsy under uniform conditions (the same environment). Importantly, dogs are large enough to accommodate devices designed for human use. The hypotheses driving this proposal are that focal seizures are not random events and there are brain states associated with low or high probability of seizure occurrence, and that these states can be reliably classified using machine learning approaches (SVM & Universum-SVM) that combine features from iEEG, behavioral state tracking, and electrocardiogram (ECG) heart rate variability. The goal of this proposal is to develop reliable seizure forecasting (when possible) and improved understanding (data characterization) when good forecasting is not possible.

"Exploring thalamocortical neural state space for adaptive closed-loop deep brain stimulation of epileptic networks. Despite the high prevalence of epilepsy, which affects nearly 4% of the population over their lifetime, roughly one third of afflicted patients are incompletely responsive to anticonvulsant drugs, requiring in severe cases neurosurgical resections or novel approaches such as deep-brain stimulation (DBS). Recently, I helped develop an electrophysiology-based online DBS protocol for seizure detection and interruption in rodent models of absence epilepsy, a form of epilepsy involving aberrant thalamocortical activity. However, like other online DBS procedures which detect seizures as they occur, there was little ability to predict incipient seizures due in large part to limited spatiotemporal resolution of the signal we used, the electrocorticogram (ECoG). ECoG and related electroencephalogram (EEG), being large scale local field potential approaches, do not provide single-cell resolution of neural dynamics that are likely required to obtain predictive information. Over the last decade, the field of brain-machine interface (BMI) has made breakthroughs in neuroscience and engineering by developing methods for multi-electrode array recording of large scale neural spiking activity and efficient reduction of the resultant high-dimensional neural activity to a smaller number of dimensions to effectively control neural prostheses. We predict that this approach will be invaluable for understanding neural dynamics during seizures and stimulation, and for developing predictive algorithms and adaptive DBS protocols.  Therefore, the goal of this project is to precisely characterize thalamocortical neural activity during spontaneous absence seizures and following thalamic stimulation by combining large-scale thalamic and cortical neural recordings, optogenetics, and BMI mathematical techniques. Additionally, the experiments presented in this proposal will use the recorded neural activity to develop adaptive algorithms that both predict oncoming seizure activity and modify stimulation parameters based on the neural state and response to stimulation in real-time. This proposal is aimed towards increasing our understanding of the neural dynamics of epileptic networks and improving the efficacy and safety of online DBS. Roughly one third of epileptic patients are resistant to pharmacological treatment, which has promoted the development of deep brain stimulation (DBS) as a means to detect and prevent seizures. However, the neural activity underlying epileptic discharges and the effects of DBS on this activity are poorly understood, partially due to the limited information carried by the EEG signals used for monitoring seizures. A more precise characterization of epileptic neural circuits is crucial to improve current DBS design and enhance the sensitivity and efficacy of seizure detection and disruption, which demands the tools and resources of basic research.",Exploring thalamocortical neural state space for adaptive closed-loop deep brain stimulation of epileptic networks.,9604827,F31NS100265,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anticonvulsants ', ' Anticonvulsive Drugs ', ' Anticonvulsive Agents ', ' Anticonvulsant Drugs ', ' Anticonvulsant Agent ', ' Awareness ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Electrodes ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Engineering ', ' epileptogenic ', ' epileptiform ', ' epilepsia ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' Epileptics ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epilepsy ', ' petit mal seizure ', ' Pyknolepsy ', ' Pykno-Epilepsy ', ' Petit Mal Epilepsy ', ' Petit Mal Convulsion ', ' Minor Epilepsy ', ' Juvenile Absence Epilepsy ', ' Childhood Absence Epilepsy ', ' Absence Seizures ', ' Absence Seizure Disorder ', ' Absence Epilepsy ', ' Exhibits ', ' Goals ', ' Math ', ' Mathematics ', ' Methods ', ' Motor Cortex ', ' body movement ', ' Movement ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Patients ', ' Primates Mammals ', ' Primates ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Rat ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Rattus ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodent ', ' Safety ', ' Seizures ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' thalamic ', ' Thalamus ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Refractory ', ' insight ', ' Generalized seizures ', ' Individual ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Deep Brain Stimulation ', ' Principal Component Analysis ', ' Principal Component Analyses ', ' Electrocorticogram ', ' electrocorticography ', ' Dimensions ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' neural prosthesis ', ' neural prosthetic ', ' neuroregulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neural regulation ', ' neural control ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Sorting - Cell Movement ', ' sorting ', ' Appearance ', ' Excision ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' neural circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Detection ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Interruption ', ' Resolution ', ' Pharmacological Treatment ', ' Rodent Model ', ' Monitor ', ' Preparation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electroencephalogram ', ' Output ', ' markov model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' brain machine interface ', ' Population ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' Implant ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' optogenetics ', ' multi-electrode arrays ', ' multielectrode arrays ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' high dimensionality ', ' ']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F31,2019,33104,CA-18,0.32645874612668363
"SCH: INT: Collaborative Research: Multimodal Signal Analysis and Data Fusion for Post-traumatic Epilepsy The research objective of this proposal, Multimodal Signal Analysis and Data Fusion for Post-traumatic Epilepsy Prediction, with Pl Dominique Duncan from the University of Southern California, is to predict the onset of epileptic seizures following traumatic brain injury (TBI), using innovative analytic tools from machine learning and applied mathematics to identify features of epileptiform activity, from a multimodal dataset collected from both an animal model and human patients. The proposed research will accelerate the discovery of salient and robust features of epileptogenesis following TBI from a rich dataset, collected from the Epilepsy Bioinformatics Study for Antiepileptogenic Therapy (EpiBioS4Rx), as it is being acquired by investigating state-of-the-art models, methods, and algorithms from contemporary machine learning theory. This secondary use of data to support automated discovery of reliable knowledge from aggregated records of animal model and human patient data will lead to innovative models to predict post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE). This machine learning based investigation of a rich dataset complements ongoing data acquisition and classical biostatistics-based analyses ongoing in the study and can lead to rigorous outcomes for the development of antiepileptogenic therapies, which can prevent this disease. Identifying salient features in time series and images to help design a predictor of PTE using data from two species and multiple individuals with heterogeneous TBI conditions presents significant theoretical challenges that need to be tackled. In this project, it is proposed to adopt transfer learning and domain adaptation perspectives to accomplish these goals in multimodal biomedical datasets across two populations. Specifically, techniques emerging from d,eep learning literature will be exploited to augment data, share parameters across model components to reduce the number of parameters that need to be optimized, and use state-of-the-art architectures to develop models for feature extraction. These will be compared against established pipelines of hand-crafted feature extraction in rigorous cross-validation analyses. Developed techniques for transfer learning will be able to extract features that generalize across animal and human data. Moreover, these theoretical techniques with associated models and optimization methods will be applicable to other multi-species transfer learning challenges that may arise in the context of health and medicine. Multimodal feature extraction and discriminative model learning for disease onset prediction using novel classifiers also offer insights into biomarker discovery using advanced machine learning techniques through joint multimodal data analysis. A significant percentage of people develop epilepsy after a moderate-severe traumatic brain injury. If we can identify who will develop post-traumatic epilepsy and at what time point after the injury, those patients can be treated with antiepileptogenic therapies and medications to stop or prevent the seizures from occurring. It is likely that biomarkers of epileptogenesis after TBI can only be found by analyzing multimodal data from a large population, which requires advanced mathematical tools and models.",SCH: INT: Collaborative Research: Multimodal Signal Analysis and Data Fusion for Post-traumatic Epilepsy,9756832,R01NS111744,"['Algorithms ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' California ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Decision Trees ', ' Diffusion ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' EEG ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' epileptogenic ', ' epileptiform ', ' epilepsia ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' Epileptics ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Traumatic Epilepsy ', ' Posttraumatic Seizure Disorder ', ' Posttraumatic Epilepsy ', ' Post-Traumatic Seizure Disorder ', ' Post-Traumatic Epilepsy ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Hand ', ' Health ', ' High Frequency Oscillation ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hippocampus ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Joints ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Limbic System ', ' Literature ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Math ', ' Mathematics ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Statistical Models ', ' neurophysiological ', ' neurophysiology ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Proteins ', ' Theoretical Techniques ', ' Theoretical Technics ', ' Psychological Technics ', ' Psychologic Techniques ', ' Psychologic Technics ', ' Psychological Techniques ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Rat ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Rattus ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Scalp ', ' Scalp structure ', ' Seizures ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' thalamic ', ' Thalamus ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' training transfer ', ' learning transfer ', ' Psychological Transfer ', ' Universities ', ' Voting ', ' Work ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Blood Sample ', ' improved ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Chemicals ', ' insight ', ' Intuition ', ' Individual ', ' Onset of illness ', ' disorder onset ', ' disease onset ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Knowledge ', ' Adopted ', ' Investigation ', ' Techniques ', ' human data ', ' Performance ', ' animal data ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Graph ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' theories ', ' Traumatic Brain Injury ', ' traumatic brain damage ', ' Brain Trauma ', ' MicroRNAs ', ' miRNAs ', ' miRNA ', ' Micro RNA ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' dMRI ', ' Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Diffusion weighted imaging ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' DWI-MRI ', ' DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' imaging method ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging modality ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' Update ', ' Validation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Epileptogenesis ', ' Outcome ', ' Antiepileptogenic ', ' Anti-epileptogenic ', ' Population ', ' Trauma ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' analytical tool ', ' data acquisition ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' laboratory experiment ', ' laboratory exercise ', ' laboratory assignment ', ' laboratory activity ', ' lab experiment ', ' lab assignment ', ' biomarker discovery ', ' deep learning ', ' neural network ', ' random forest ', ' multimodal data ', ' multi-modal data ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2019,250346,CA-37,0.1945419173370321
"Interictal high frequency oscillations as non-invasive biomarkers of epileptogenicity in pediatric patients Project Summary Crucial to the success of epilepsy surgery is the availability of a robust presurgical biomarker to identify the epileptogenic zone (EZ). Complete resection of the EZ may lead to medication and seizure freedom. Since the EZ cannot be measured directly, its location is estimated indirectly based on concordant data from a multitude of noninvasive tests. Yet, the results of these tests are often insufficiently concordant or inconclusive. Intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) serves as the gold standard for the delineation of the seizure onset zone (SOZ). However, the SOZ does not always predict the surgical outcome, and its delineation requires many days of recordings to capture clinical seizures. High-frequency oscillations (HFOs), recorded with iEEG are promising interictal biomarkers of the EZ. Yet, their clinical value for epilepsy surgery is still debated since the HFO-generating area is often relatively large and its complete resection may overlap with eloquent areas. This is often attributed to the presence of physiological HFOs in non-epileptogenic areas. In our recent iEEG study, we showed that interictal HFOs are initiated by an onset generator and spread to other brain areas over time. This generator constitutes a promising interictal biomarker of the EZ since its resection is associated with good surgical outcome. Despite the copious literature on HFOs, the clinical value of HFOs for surgery has been only investigated using iEEG, which presents serious limitations due to its invasiveness and its limited spatial sampling. This application aims to noninvasively localize interictal HFOs with high-density electroencephalography (HD-EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) in children with medically refractory epilepsy (MRE), distinguish pathological from physiological HFOs, and assess the noninvasive localization of the HFO-onset generator with respect to the surgical resection and patients’ outcome. Our hypothesis is that HD-EEG and MEG can distinguish pathological from physiological HFOs non-invasively and can localize the HFO-onset generator whose removal leads to better surgical outcome than the removal of the area of secondary spread. To test our hypothesis, we specifically aim to: (i) assess the ability of HD-EEG and MEG to localize HFOs; (ii) differentiate physiological (nHFOs) from pathological (pHFOs) HFOs using unsupervised machine learning; (iii) localize noninvasively the HFO-onset generator and compare it with the clinical gold standard for resection tailoring, i.e. the iEEG-defined SOZ; and (iv) assess the predictive value of the HFO- onset generator in terms of surgical outcome. To pursue these aims, we will record HD-EEG and MEG data from 50 children (0-18 years old) with MRE and 50 typically developing (TD) children. This application combines the use of cutting-edge pediatric neuroimaging instruments, 3D printing technology, and innovative signal processing tools together with extensive neuroimaging experience with children. Our research will have a direct impact on the life of children with MRE since it will provide a new noninvasive biomarker of the EZ that would limit invasive long-term monitoring, augment presurgical planning, and improve the surgical outcome. Narrative To lessen the negative impact of medically refractory epilepsy in children, a new pre-surgical noninvasive biomarker that identifies reliably the area of the brain that generates the epileptic seizures is essential. The proposed experiments are relevant to public health because they may lead to a significant improvement of the presurgical evaluation procedure and postsurgical outcome of pediatric patients with refractory epilepsy. The project is relevant to NINDS’s mission because the resulting findings could significantly improve the quality of life in children with epilepsy, one of the most common pediatric neurological disorders, which has a major impact on children’s development and may significantly affect their adult life.",Interictal high frequency oscillations as non-invasive biomarkers of epileptogenicity in pediatric patients,9816907,R01NS104116,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Child Development ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Electrodes ', ' EEG ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' epileptogenic ', ' epileptiform ', ' epilepsia ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' Epileptics ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Liberty ', ' Freedom ', ' Gold ', ' Head ', ' High Frequency Oscillation ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Literature ', ' magnetoencephalographic imaging ', ' MEG imaging ', ' Magnetoencephalography ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' neurosurgery ', ' Patients ', ' Printing ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' Seizures ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Spatial Distribution ', ' Specificity ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Refractory ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' tool ', ' instrument ', ' Life ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' 3D ', ' 3-D ', ' Location ', ' Test Result ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' novel ', ' Excision ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' Sampling ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Pathologic ', ' Monitor ', ' Resected ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke ', ' National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke ', ' NINDS ', ' Outcome ', ' blind ', ' visual motor ', ' visuomotor ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' 18 year old ', ' eighteen years of age ', ' eighteen year old ', ' age 18 years ', ' 18 years of age ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' 3D Print ', ' three dimensional printing ', ' 3D printer ', ' 3-D printer ', ' 3-D print ', ' signal processing ', ' pediatric patients ', ' child patients ', ' improved outcome ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' surgery outcome ', ' surgical outcome ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' ']",NINDS,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2019,3384,MA-07,0.17362087807829338
"Model Development for Prediction of Surgical Outcome in Temporal Lobe Epilepsy Patients: Incorporation of the Correlation between Post-Surgical Reorganization Phenotypes and Pre-Surgical Data Project Summary For epileptic patients who undergo brain resection or ablation interventions, it is the postoperative brain that will dictate seizure status, whether controlled or relapsed. Yet, it is data from the preoperative brain that drives the postoperative prediction process – a critical process for both patient and doctor, and one that is only clinically meaningful when seizure outcomes are predicted presurgically to optimize surgical-decision making. Accordingly, we propose to develop a multi-step model that will establish more accurate predictors of post- surgical seizure outcome in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) emphasizing post-surgical status, for it is the areas of the brain spared during surgery that form the neural substrates generating postoperative seizures. A second perspective motivating our project is the need to identify those changes in functional and structural brain network organization that support adaptive versus maladaptive seizure outcomes following brain surgery. These are the network changes (e.g., the new seizure generators) that dispose and place a potential surgical candidate on a specific outcome trajectory. Therefore, identifying the phenotypes of brain reorganization and change, and incorporating their status into presurgical predictive models of outcome will likely prove crucial to enhancing our ability to predict postoperative neuroplastic responses. While existing outcome prediction models in TLE have focused on clinical variables (e.g., lesional status), we choose instead to focus on structural and functional measures of network reorganization (communication dynamics, regional interactions, structural control). This stems from our belief that capturing network changes throughout the whole postsurgical brain offers a better practical method for identifying and predicting the latent seizure foci (epileptogenesis) that will emerge after surgery. Through machine learning techniques we will deliver an algorithm to be used with new, potential surgical patients, an algorithm that utilizes solely presurgical data, but incorporates our innovative prediction about postsurgical brain organization. Accordingly, our approach provides both a methodologic and conceptual (reorganization phenotypes) advance. The scientific premise leading to our hypotheses is that the failure in the literature to account for the impact of unresected/ablated brain regions, and the brain reorganizations these areas compel, has seriously impeded the predictive power of previous outcome models. Project Narrative For epileptic patients undergoing brain surgery, it is the postoperative brain that will dictate whether seizures are controlled or not. Accordingly, we propose to develop a model that predicts post-surgical seizure outcome in temporal lobe epilepsy, emphasizing the reorganization and change in brain network communication and control that comes with post-surgical status, for it is these features that will actually generate postsurgical seizures. Our innovation is the use of post-operative brain reorganization phenotypes to predict on a presurgical basis who will be disposed to a good vs poor outcome trajectory, highlighting that it is the failure to account for the impact of spared regions, and the brain organization changes these compel, which has seriously impeded the predictive power of prior outcome models.",Model Development for Prediction of Surgical Outcome in Temporal Lobe Epilepsy Patients: Incorporation of the Correlation between Post-Surgical Reorganization Phenotypes and Pre-Surgical Data,9803083,R01NS112816,"['Algorithms ', ' Belief ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Decision Making ', ' epileptogenic ', ' epileptiform ', ' epilepsia ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' Epileptics ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Generalized Seizure Disorder ', ' Generalized Epilepsy ', ' Temporal Lobe Epilepsy ', ' Liberty ', ' Freedom ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Literature ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' neuroplasticity ', ' neuroplastic ', ' neural plasticity ', ' CNS plasticity ', ' Neuronal Plasticity ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Postoperative ', ' Post-Operative ', ' Postoperative Period ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' Relapse ', ' Rest ', ' Seizures ', ' temporal cortex ', ' Temporal Lobe ', ' thalamic ', ' Thalamus ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Organizational Change ', ' base ', ' brain surgery ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Lesion ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Ablation ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Structure ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' novel ', ' Excision ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' model development ', ' Brain region ', ' Data ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Process ', ' Output ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' Epileptogenesis ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' stem ', ' standard measure ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' recruit ', ' surgery outcome ', ' surgical outcome ', ' random forest ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' ']",NINDS,THOMAS JEFFERSON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,490043,PA-03,0.3490772749377549
"Investigation of Stereotyped High-Frequency Oscillations with Computational Intelligence for the Prediction of Seizure Onset Zone in Epilepsy PROJECT SUMMARY Neurosurgical therapy of refractory epilepsy requires accurate localization of seizure onset zone (SOZ). In clinical practice, intracranial EEG (iEEG) is recorded in the epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU) over many days where multiple seizures are recorded to provide information to localize the SOZ. The prolonged monitoring in the EMU adds to the risk of complications and can include intracranial bleeding and potentially death. Recently, high frequency oscillations (HFO) of iEEG between 80 to 500 Hz are highly valued as a promising clinical biomarker for epilepsy. HFOs are believed to be clinically significant, and thus could be used for SOZ localization. However, HFOs can also be recorded from normal and non-epileptic cerebral structures. When defined only by rate or frequency, pathological HFOs are indistinguishable from physiological ones, which limit their application in epilepsy pre-surgical planning. In this proposal, to the best of our knowledge, we show of a recurrent waveform pattern that distinguishes pathological HFOs from physiological ones. In particular, we observed that the SOZ generates repeatedly a set of stereotyped HFO waveforms whereas the HFOs from nonepileptic regions were irregular in their waveform morphology. Based on these observations, using computational tools built on recent advances in sparse coding and unsupervised machine learning techniques, we propose to detect these stereotyped recurrent HFO waveform patterns directly from the continuous iEEG data of adult and pediatric patients and test their prognostic value by correlating the spatial distribution of detected events to clinical findings such as SOZ, resection zone and seizure freedom. We hypothesize that accurate detection of pathologic HFOs in brief iEEG recordings can identify the SOZ and eliminate the necessity of prolonged EMU monitoring and reduce the associated risks. With these motivations, in this project an interdisciplinary team composed of biomedical engineers, epileptologists and neurosurgeons will work together to develop and test novel computational tools to detect stereotyped HFOs and its subtypes in large iEEG datasets recorded with clinical electrodes. Developed algorithms and iEEG data will be shared with the research community to contribute to the reproducible research and help other research groups to develop novel methods. The results of this study will be essential for achieving our group's long term goal of developing an online neural signal processing system for the rapid and accurate identification of SOZ with brief invasive recording. PROJECT NARRATIVE Prolonged iEEG monitoring for SOZ localization does add to the risk of complications and may include serious issues, such as intracranial bleeding, meningoencephalitis, and eventually death.

"A Brain Atlas for Mapping Connectivity in Focal Epilepsy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Treatment of intractable focal epilepsy by resection of the seizure onset zone (SOZ) is often effective provided the SOZ can be reliably identified. Focal epilepsy, however, is fundamentally a network-based disease. The seizure onset zone is connected to a network whose other nodes may also exhibit abnormal neural activity either concurrently or subsequently. In patients without MRI detectable lesions, differentiation of the onset zone from these other nodes in the network can be difficult, even with the use of invasive recordings. The goal of this project is to improve SOZ identification, ultimately reducing the need for presurgical invasive recordings where possible, and guiding placement of electrodes in those patients who do need invasive monitoring. To achieve this goal, in Aim 1 we will build a functional connectivity atlas from a database of invasive Cortico-Cortical Evoked Potential (CCEP) recordings to identify common interaction networks in patients with partial epilepsy and to investigate the degree to which these are dependent on the location of the SOZ. To construct the atlas, patient data will be coregistered to a labelled anatomical atlas using a cortically constrained warping of each subject's structural MRI. In Aim 2, CCEPs data will be supplemented in the atlas with other data that provide additional insight into the brain regions involved in the seizure: regions of hypometabolism in interictal FDG PET, hypermetabolism in ictal SPECT, interictal spike localization from EEG and MEG and invasive recordings, functional areas associated with seizure semiology, MR-identified lesions, area of resection, post-surgical Engel classification. Using machine-learning methods, we will perform a sequence of tests to examine the degree to which the atlas can be used to identify the SOZ in individual subjects. Finally, in Aim 3, we will investigate the potential for using regional connectivity established frm noninvasive MEG data and resting state MRI in combination with the CCEPs atlas to identify these networks, with the ultimate goal of reducing the need for invasive monitoring. Retrospective analysis using a leave-one- out approach and comparison with outcomes will be used to quantify improvement in identification of the onset zone from both invasive and noninvasive recordings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Epilepsy affects millions of Americans, and for many, surgery is the best option to control their seizures. Improved surgical outcomes, however, requires a better understanding of the brain networks involved in seizure propagation. A brain atlas using data recorded from electrodes implanted in patients will yield new insights into pathways of the brain and will ultimately assist neurologists and neurosurgeons in better localizing and resecting the area of the brain that is causing seizures.",A Brain Atlas for Mapping Connectivity in Focal Epilepsy,9645112,R01NS089212,"['Affect ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Atlases ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Electrodes ', ' Implanted Electrodes ', ' EEG ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' epileptogenic ', ' epileptiform ', ' epilepsia ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' Epileptics ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Partial Seizure Disorder ', ' Localization-Related Epilepsy ', ' Focal Seizure Disorder ', ' Focal Epilepsy ', ' Partial Epilepsies ', ' Evoked Potentials ', ' Exhibits ', ' Goals ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Maps ', ' Patients ', ' positron emitting tomography ', ' positron emission tomographic imaging ', ' positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging ', ' Rad.-PET ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Scan ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Medical Imaging ', ' PETT ', ' PETSCAN ', ' PET imaging ', ' PET Scan ', ' PET ', ' Positron-Emission Tomography ', ' Rest ', ' Scalp ', ' Scalp structure ', ' Seizures ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Single-Photon Emission-Computed Radionuclide Tomography ', ' SPECT imaging ', ' SPECT ', ' single photon emission computed tomography ', ' computerized tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' catscan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' EMI scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' CT scan ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CAT scan ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' Measures ', ' Frontal Lobe Epilepsy ', ' density ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Lesion ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Neurologist ', ' Neurosurgeon ', ' neuro-surgeon ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' interest ', ' American ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Categories ', ' Modality ', ' Excision ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' brain pathway ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ', ' fluorodeoxyglucose PET ', ' FDG PET ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Measurable ', ' Monitor ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' Implant ', ' Network-based ', ' public health relevance ', ' preimplantation ', ' pre-implantation ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' source localization ', ' surgery outcome ', ' surgical outcome ', ' ']",NINDS,CLEVELAND CLINIC LERNER COM-CWRU,R01,2019,516327,OH-11,0.3601742230529542
"Predicting Epilepsy Surgery Outcomes Using Neural Network Architecture Abstract Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is one of the most common forms of pharmacologically resistant epilepsy. The resection or ablation of medial temporal structures can be curative for many patients. Unfortunately, approximately one third of patients who undergo TLE surgery continue to have disabling seizures post- procedurally. The reasons for suboptimal outcomes are not well understood and therefore constitute a very important knowledge gap in epilepsy care. A better understanding of this difference in surgical response phenotype could be used to improve surgical planning, treatment, outcome prediction and counseling. Promising preliminary studies suggest that TLE surgical outcomes can be inferred by neuroimaging computational tools assessing the cumulative degree of abnormalities in the topological organization of structural networks involving limbic and extra-limbic regions. Nonetheless, network abnormalities are not routinely or systematically used and quantified in the pre-surgical evaluation of epilepsies, and their assessment requires refinement and further validation. The purpose of this proposal is to perform a prospective study to test the hypothesis that the degree of limbic and extra-limbic network abnormalities in TLE, systematically assessed using a connectome approach based on optimized diffusion MRI (dMRI), can be used to predict and better understand epilepsy surgery outcomes. This hypothesis builds on the well-defined basic science and neurobiological premises that epilepsy is associated with pathological alterations in networks that are related to seizure onset and seizure propagation. Importantly, network abnormalities are not visible on routine MRI, but their detection using connectomes constitutes a modern approach to quantifying the location and magnitude of “lesional epilepsy,” where broad computational network abnormalities imply worse outcomes. We will prospectively gather clinical and imaging data at six epilepsy centers using the NIH epilepsy common data elements. This project will be fundamentally based on standard of care data, thus minimizing the burden of extra data collection and ensuring feasibility. Furthermore, this project will be embedded in the ENIGMA-Epilepsy framework, which is a collaborative platform for clinical and neuromaging multi-center research. Specific Aim 1 will define the accuracy, reproducibility, and predictive values of the pre-surgical dMRI tractography connectome model towards surgical results in TLE. We will perform hypothesis-driven tests of specific limbic and extra-limbic networks in relationship with clinical data and surgical outcomes. Specific Aim 2 will test if the neuroimaging-clinical outcome model can be further improved with advanced diffusion methods (multi-shell diffusional kurtosis imaging), resting state functional MRI networks, or a multimodal approach. We believe that this research will have an important impact on our understanding of the mechanisms related to TLE treatment. NARRATIVE While some patients can become seizure free with epilepsy surgery, others persist with disabling seizures and the reasons for vastly dissimilar outcomes are not well understood. Increasing evidence suggests that epilepsy-related neuronal network reorganization is at the core of the mechanisms underlying epilepsy severity and seizure control. This project will use individualized mapping of white matter neural networks to better understand the pathophysiology of epilepsy, identify reasons for treatment success, and guide strategies to improve surgical treatment.",Predicting Epilepsy Surgery Outcomes Using Neural Network Architecture,9840235,R01NS110347,"['Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain Mapping ', ' Counseling ', ' Data Collection ', ' Diffusion ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Thermocoagulation ', ' Surgical Diathermy ', ' Galvanocautery ', ' Fulguration ', ' Endocavitary Fulguration ', ' Electrocautery ', ' Electrocoagulation ', ' EEG ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' epileptogenic ', ' epileptiform ', ' epilepsia ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' Epileptics ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Tonic-Clonic Seizure Syndrome ', ' Tonic-Clonic Convulsion Syndrome ', ' Tonic-Clonic Convulsion Disorder ', ' Tonic Clonic Seizure Disorder ', ' Tonic Clonic Convulsions ', ' Major Motor Seizure Disorder ', ' Major Epilepsy ', ' Grand Mal Seizure Disorder ', ' Grand Mal Epilepsy ', ' Grand Mal Convulsions ', ' Tonic-Clonic Epilepsy ', ' Temporal Lobe Epilepsy ', ' Liberty ', ' Freedom ', ' Future ', ' substantia grisea ', ' gray matter ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hippocampus ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Scalp ', ' Scalp structure ', ' Seizures ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' thalamic ', ' Thalamus ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Medial ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Refractory ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Lesion ', ' Fiber ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Functional disorder ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Knowledge ', ' millimeter ', ' Severities ', ' Contralateral ', ' Location ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Ablation ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' neuronal circuitry ', ' neuronal circuit ', ' Structure ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' white matter ', ' substantia alba ', ' organizational structure ', ' Organization Charts ', ' Modality ', ' Excision ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Anterior Temporal Lobectomy ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' dMRI ', ' Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Diffusion weighted imaging ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' DWI-MRI ', ' DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) ', ' imaging method ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Validation ', ' Pathologic ', ' Common Data Element ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' hippocampal atrophy ', ' hippocampal atropy ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' standard of care ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' connectome ', ' Prospective cohort ', ' tractography ', ' recruit ', ' surgery outcome ', ' surgical outcome ', ' neural network ', ' neural network architecture ', ' neural net architecture ', ' ']",NINDS,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R01,2019,696066,SC-01,0.356870430052695
"Characterizing High Frequency Oscillations as an epilepsy biomarker with Big Data tools ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epilepsy is one of the world's most prevalent diseases, yet the rate of uncontrolled seizures has not changed in decades. One of the reasons for this is our limited understanding of seizure mechanisms, and so one of the main goals of epilepsy research is to identify new biomarkers to help us understand the nature of the disease. Recent technological advancements now allow us to monitor brain activity with much higher resolution, which have led to the identification of promising potential biomarkers such as High Frequency Oscillations (HFOs). Unfortunately, clinicians still have not determined how to utilize this information under clinical conditions. There are three main obstacles to implementing HFOs in practice: 1) it is unclear how to acquire them in a practical way; 2) it is unclear how to ascertain which HFOs are truly related to epilepsy; and 3) it is unclear how to use the HFO data in a prospective fashion to improve clinical care. The purpose of this project is overcome each of these obstacles. The first Aim validates a universal computer algorithm that can identify HFOs automatically, then tests how to use HFO rate as method to identify where seizures will start. This method improves upon past work by improving the precision of HFO detection and determining how to avoid false predictions that would lead to unnecessary surgery. The second Aim addresses a major unsolved problem in HFO research: HFOs are seen in normal brain as well as in epilepsy. This Aim will use state-of-the- art machine learning tools to process a vast dataset of HFO collected from over 100 patients to determine how to distinguish epileptic from normal HFOs. The third Aim will analyze how HFOs change over time, a largely unexplored characteristic of HFOs that cannot be evaluated without very large datasets. These Aims together serve as the framework to establish HFOs as a clinically viable biomarker of seizures, allowing their translation into clinical epilepsy care and leading to future prospective clinical studies identifying the location and timing of seizure onset. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to characterize a novel biomarker of seizures using advanced computer algorithms that monitor brainwaves in real time.

"Distributed networks underlying depression in epilepsy: a computational circuit-based approach to biomarker development PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Adult patients with epilepsy have an increased prevalence of major depression and other psychiatric co- morbidities. Depression in epilepsy is associated with worse outcome and quality of life. However, it continues to be underdiagnosed and untreated and further attention to this comorbidity is critical. My career goal is to become an academic neuroscientist and clinician focused on understanding the neural networks underlying co- morbid mood and anxiety spectrum disorders in patients with epilepsy.  Specific brain circuits may underlie depression and be commonly affected by different precipitants (i.e. stress, inflammation, epilepsy). In this proposal, our model is that a set of neural features across these brain circuits will be shared across many patients with co-morbid depression. Evidence for a strong relationship between epilepsy and depression includes the presence of depression symptoms before, during, after, and in between seizures, evidence of cases of concurrent onset of depression and epilepsy, an increased incidence of interictal depression when limbic structures are involved in seizure occurrence, and evidence that depression scores may be lower after surgical resection for medication refractory epilepsy. Intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) captured during the pre-surgical recording period offers a particularly promising method to study depression networks in adult epilepsy, offering both high temporal resolution and spatial precision. Despite the enormous potential of iEEG, there are no studies to date that examine the neurophysiological signatures of network dysfunction in mood and anxiety disorders in patients with epilepsy. Such studies are critical in order to better understand the etiology of co-morbid depression and could lead to novel personalized therapies.  In our pilot work, we identify a set of power spectral measures within a corticolimbic circuit that appear to be linked to depression and are, therefore, a potential biomarker of co-morbid depression. We also found evidence that supports the basis for testing whether neural features will predict treatment outcome. This proposal builds on these preliminary findings to validate our model and test the hypothesis that a set of neural features is shared across some subjects with MDD in epilepsy and is detectable with machine-learning techniques applied to interictal iEEG recordings. Aim 1 demonstrates the relationship between resting state neural circuit abnormality and depression. Aim 2 tests whether removing the dysfunctional region of the circuit improves depression and whether the presurgical resting state iEEG predicts that improvement.  To address these research goals, I will need more rigorous training in computational neuroscience for complex datasets, advanced signal processing, and biostatistics. My training plan and carefully selected mentoring and advisory team across fields of psychiatry, neurosurgery, neurology and statistics will allow me to obtain the necessary experiences to become a fully independent investigator who brings the tools of computational approaches to the service of mental health research and novel personalized treatment paradigms in epilepsy. PROJECT NARRATIVE Psychiatric co-morbidities in epilepsy are common, undertreated, and poorly understood. Using intracranial recordings in patients who will undergo epilepsy surgery for medication-refractory disease, we propose to test a model that a set of neural features is shared across subjects with depression in epilepsy.

"EEG and MRI Biomarkers to Predict Post-traumatic Epilepsy Project Summary Dr. Jennifer A. Kim is a critical care neurologist and neuroscientist at Yale-New Haven Hospital. Her long-term career goal is to become an independently funded translational investigator with expertise in signal processing of neurophysiologic and neuroimaging data to identify early biomarkers of secondary brain injury in critically ill patients, particularly related to post-traumatic epilepsy. Post-traumatic epilepsy is a disabling complication of traumatic brain injury (TBI). There is an urgent need to find biomarkers of post-traumatic epilepsy to identify patients at high risk for developing this complication. It is a population in which early biomarker identification could improve patient monitoring and ultimately treatment development to circumvent epileptogenesis. Post- traumatic epilepsy contributes to worsening of the already high rates of TBI morbidity, disability and cost of care, thus emphasizing the importance of preventing this complication. We need to find biomarkers to best define those most likely to benefit from potential treatments and make such treatment discovery trials more feasible. During the proposed training period, the candidate will expand upon her knowledge of EEG signal processing and machine learning techniques and acquire new skills in neuroimaging analysis using Magnetic Resonance technologies and biostatistics. To accomplish this, Dr. Kim has brought together a strong mentorship team of Dr. Hal Blumenfeld (primary mentor) and co-mentors Drs. Todd Constable, Brandon Westover and Brian Edlow who have expertise in multi-modal approaches to studying epilepsy, functional MRI analysis, computational EEG analysis and structural TBI imaging, respectively. Under their mentorship, Dr. Kim proposes to: 1) quantify epileptiform abnormality (EA) frequency and identify EA waveform features that optimally predict PTE, 2) determine if direct hippocampal injury, assessed by cortical thickness and contusion volume, stratifies PTE risk 3) assess whether indirect hippocampal injury, based on structural and functional MRI connectivity analyses, portend PTE. The overall goal is to identify early biomarkers of patients at high risk for post-traumatic epilepsy to target development of anti-epileptogenesis treatments. Bringing together advanced neurophysiologic and neuroimaging analysis and this strong mentorship support, this project opens new avenues for optimizing follow-up care and advancing potential treatment development for all traumatic brain injury patients at risk for post-traumatic epilepsy. This well-defined patient-oriented research proposal, in concert with the mentorship and structured didactic curriculum, will provide Dr. Kim with the skills that are essential to develop an independent career in neurophysiological and neuroimaging research that translates to improving patient outcomes. Project Narrative Post-traumatic epilepsy, a seizure disorder secondary to traumatic brain injury (TBI), is among the most disabling and difficult-to-treat complications of TBI. Currently, there are no tools to identify patients a priori at highest risk for PTE.

"Neurophysiology of Human Cortical Epilepsy ABSTRACT Epilepsy remains a devastating and poorly understood illness whose therapies are inadequate for many patients and, in large degree, unchanged for decades. The experiments proposed in this project utilize novel microelectrode recording techniques in patients with epilepsy as well as quantitative features and large data sets to obtain information about the neuronal dynamics underlying epilepsy at an unprecedented level of resolution. The primary hypothesis of this project is that this high resolution, multi-scale information can be applied to separate seizures into different classes which differ in the mechanisms which underlie seizure initiation. More specifically, we will be examining the role and interplay of widespread networks, different cortical layers, infraslow activity and both excitatory and inhibitory single neuronal activity as seizures start. We expect to find substantial differences in these different features of neural action in different kinds of seizures. This knowledge will foster the development of a more complete understanding of seizures and how they can be better detected, predicted and ultimately controlled.

"Model Development for Prediction of Surgical Outcome in Temporal Lobe Epilepsy Patients: Incorporation of the Correlation between Post-Surgical Reorganization Phenotypes and Pre-Surgical Data Project Summary For epileptic patients who undergo brain resection or ablation interventions, it is the postoperative brain that will dictate seizure status, whether controlled or relapsed. Yet, it is data from the preoperative brain that drives the postoperative prediction process – a critical process for both patient and doctor, and one that is only clinically meaningful when seizure outcomes are predicted presurgically to optimize surgical-decision making. Accordingly, we propose to develop a multi-step model that will establish more accurate predictors of post- surgical seizure outcome in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) emphasizing post-surgical status, for it is the areas of the brain spared during surgery that form the neural substrates generating postoperative seizures. A second perspective motivating our project is the need to identify those changes in functional and structural brain network organization that support adaptive versus maladaptive seizure outcomes following brain surgery. These are the network changes (e.g., the new seizure generators) that dispose and place a potential surgical candidate on a specific outcome trajectory. Therefore, identifying the phenotypes of brain reorganization and change, and incorporating their status into presurgical predictive models of outcome will likely prove crucial to enhancing our ability to predict postoperative neuroplastic responses. While existing outcome prediction models in TLE have focused on clinical variables (e.g., lesional status), we choose instead to focus on structural and functional measures of network reorganization (communication dynamics, regional interactions, structural control). This stems from our belief that capturing network changes throughout the whole postsurgical brain offers a better practical method for identifying and predicting the latent seizure foci (epileptogenesis) that will emerge after surgery. Through machine learning techniques we will deliver an algorithm to be used with new, potential surgical patients, an algorithm that utilizes solely presurgical data, but incorporates our innovative prediction about postsurgical brain organization. Accordingly, our approach provides both a methodologic and conceptual (reorganization phenotypes) advance. The scientific premise leading to our hypotheses is that the failure in the literature to account for the impact of unresected/ablated brain regions, and the brain reorganizations these areas compel, has seriously impeded the predictive power of previous outcome models. Project Narrative For epileptic patients undergoing brain surgery, it is the postoperative brain that will dictate whether seizures are controlled or not. Accordingly, we propose to develop a model that predicts post-surgical seizure outcome in temporal lobe epilepsy, emphasizing the reorganization and change in brain network communication and control that comes with post-surgical status, for it is these features that will actually generate postsurgical seizures. Our innovation is the use of post-operative brain reorganization phenotypes to predict on a presurgical basis who will be disposed to a good vs poor outcome trajectory, highlighting that it is the failure to account for the impact of spared regions, and the brain organization changes these compel, which has seriously impeded the predictive power of prior outcome models.",Model Development for Prediction of Surgical Outcome in Temporal Lobe Epilepsy Patients: Incorporation of the Correlation between Post-Surgical Reorganization Phenotypes and Pre-Surgical Data,9966055,R01NS112816,"['Algorithms ', ' Belief ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Decision Making ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Generalized Epilepsy ', ' Generalized Seizure Disorder ', ' Temporal Lobe Epilepsy ', ' Freedom ', ' Liberty ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Literature ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Neuronal Plasticity ', ' CNS plasticity ', ' central nervous system plasticity ', ' neural plasticity ', ' neuroplastic ', ' neuroplasticity ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Postoperative Period ', ' Post-Operative ', ' Postoperative ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Relapse ', ' Rest ', ' Seizures ', ' Temporal Lobe ', ' temporal cortex ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' Thalamus ', ' thalamic ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Organizational Change ', ' base ', ' brain surgery ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Lesion ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Ablation ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' model development ', ' Brain region ', ' Data ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Process ', ' Output ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Epileptogenesis ', ' Outcome ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' stem ', ' standard measure ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' outcome prediction ', ' recruit ', ' surgical outcome ', ' surgery outcome ', ' random forest ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' ']",NINDS,THOMAS JEFFERSON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,442761,PA-03,0.3490772749377549
"Title: Neurobiology of seizure generalization during electroconvulsive therapy for major depression PROJECT SUMMARY Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a highly effective treatment for severe depression and other mental health conditions, yet how ECT changes the brain to ameliorate the symptoms of depression is not well understood. Seizure generalization appears to be critical for successful antidepressant response to ECT, and stimulation dose is adjusted to ensure an “adequate” seizure. Previous studies have linked seizure generalization during ECT with thalamocortical regions, and our own MRI studies indicate that thalamocortical networks exhibit neuroplasticity after treatment in patients who respond to ECT. Yet, despite recent growth in the number of MRI studies measuring long-term neuroplasticity across ECT sessions, relatively less is known about the neurobiology of seizure activity elicited during each session. The long-term goal of the proposed studies is to understand how ECT-induced seizures change brain networks to treat depression. To address this goal, we will take a data-driven, machine learning approach to pre-existing ECT-MRI datasets of patients with depression, to identify the neurobiological features measured with MRI (functional connectivity, gray-matter morphometry, electric fields) that optimally explain inter-patient variability in seizure indicators (seizure duration and stimulation dose). Aim 1 will identify biomarkers of susceptibility to ECT-induced seizures by analyzing pre-treatment MRI with respect to initial stimulation dose and seizure duration. Aim 2 studies will determine how brain network plasticity over the course of ECT relates to changes in stimulation dose and duration of ECT-induced seizures. These studies will further our understanding of therapeutic seizures in ECT, potentially facilitating prediction of optimal dose and/or treatment outcome to improve ECT and minimize side effects.

"Epilepsy Multiplatform Variant Prediction (EpiMVP) The advent of next generation DNA sequencing has revolutionized gene discovery in human diseases, including epilepsy. Hundreds of genes have been implicated in epilepsy in the last decade, revealing the diversity of biological mechanisms that can go awry in this disorder. However, the rate at which we are identifying new genes involved in epilepsy is now outpacing our ability to study disease mechanisms. Moreover, clinical gene panel or exome sequencing has become standard practice for patients with early-onset, familial, and refractory epilepsies. This rapid assimilation of genetic testing into clinical care has led to a surge in the number of genetic variants of uncertain significance (VUS), particularly the occurrence of missense VUS. These VUS are assigned to an indeterminate spectrum between pathogenic and benign, which complicate interpretation for genetic counselors, clinicians, patients and families, as well as assessment of the need for further testing. Here we propose a Center without Walls, entitled Epilepsy Multiplatform Variant Prediction (EpiMVP), spanning 5 institutions and incorporating expertise from geneticists, clinicians, computational biologists, neuroscientists, stem cell biologists, pharmacologists and electrophysiologists who have a proven track record of collaborative publications and grants, as well as stature as leaders of national and international epilepsy organizations. EpiMVP will develop a modular, highly integrated platform approach to accelerate determination of the functional, pharmacological, neuronal network and whole animal consequences of genetic variants implicated in a range of clinical epilepsy types. We will study non-ion-channel, non-receptor genes commonly implicated in epilepsy, and that are involved in diverse biological processes. Our ultimate goals are to devise an effective experimental platform for testing the pathogenicity of VUS in genes implicated in epilepsy and to generate a computational model (EpiPred) that predicts the likelihood that a variant is pathogenic or benign. This work is crucial in the pursuit of novel therapeutics and the promise of personalized medicine. The overall milestones of the Center are: 1. Evaluate genes associated with epilepsy and select candidates for analysis, model data for, and analyze all project data for development of EpiPred an iterative machine learning model to classify variants in genes implicated in epilepsy. 2. Test selected VUS using medium throughput, in vitro approaches. 3. Test selected VUS in human cortical neurons or human brain organoids using induced pluripotent stem cell approaches. 4. Test selected VUS in pre-clinical, in vivo models. The expected outcomes are: 1. Provide a freely available prediction tool for clinicians to differentiate between pathogenic and benign variants for genes implicated in epilepsy; 2. Provide experimental models to study the functional consequences of specific variants; 3. Provide a reclassification of VUS in ClinVar/ClinGen and to develop new guidelines for incorporating functional readouts into the ACMG criteria; 4. Inform the future development of novel therapeutics to treat epilepsy.

"MR Fingerprinting for Epilepsy Abstract Epilepsy affects 65 million people worldwide; approximately 30% of them do not respond to medications but can be cured by surgery. Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD), a major pathology for medically intractable epilepsies, is frequently missed by visual analysis of the conventional MRI, making surgical treatment very difficult. We propose to develop a novel quantitative MRI acquisition and analysis framework specific for epilepsy patients, which could provide more sensitive and specific measures of brain structure, thereby improving FCD detection and subtype prediction. To this end, the quantitative framework will be developed and validated in three steps: (1) Develop high-resolution Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) scan that allows simultaneous quantification of multiple tissue property maps efficiently, accurately and precisely. These quantitative maps have shown to be more sensitive and specific on detecting and characterizing subtle signal abnormalities. (2) Develop image post-processing methods to analyze quantitative maps, which will provide quantitative measurements that highlight additional morphological features, such as gray-white boundary blurring, abnormal cortical thickness and folding. (3) Develop machine-learning-based feature screening and prediction tools to characterize group-level features differentiating FCD subtypes, and predict individual-level FCD location and subtyping. Because detection and subtype prediction of FCD are both associated with seizure outcomes, epileptologists can use this tool to provide more personalized and customized counseling. The result of our proposed work promises a paradigm shift by converting the current standard-care of visual/qualitative MRI review to a quantitative framework, including data acquisition, post-processing and decision support tool, that would eventually lead to better treatment planning, reduction in unnecessary pre-surgical evaluation tests (especially invasive evaluation), and improved post-operative seizure outcomes in patients with devastating and disabling medically intractable epilepsy.

"Stress-Induced Hormonal Fluctuations and their Relation to Seizure Dynamics in Children with Epilepsy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In the new era of personalized medicine, the epilepsy field is at a tipping point to leverage emerging therapies that can being tailored to individual patient characteristics. Over 30% of children with epilepsy suffer from seizures that cannot be managed by mono- or poly-pharmacotherapies. Targeted neurostimulation and drug delivery are promising alternative therapies but, given the complexity and heterogeneity of the disorder, these therapies need to be precisely guided by the patient’s seizure dynamics. Despite decades of basic and clinical research, the latter remain elusive. In particular, seizure evolution from ictogenesis to ictal onset is poorly understood, in part due to a lack of fundamental understanding of how seizure precipitants impact the brain’s neurophysiological equilibrium, trigger ictogenesis and lead to cumulative changes that facilitate ictal onset. Although the underlying mechanisms of action of common precipitants such as stress and sleep loss are unclear, there is substantial evidence that they may modulate various hormones and neurotransmitters that impact the brain’s excitability and/or balance between excitation and inhibition. This project aims to systematically investigate the impact of large-scale hormonal fluctuations in pediatric epilepsy patients on brain dynamics, and quantify localized and distributed (network-level) electrophysiological changes during seizure evolution. Specifically, in a cohort of n = 40 patients with focal epilepsy who are undergoing continuous noninvasive neurophysiological monitoring as part of their presurgical evaluation, salivary cortisol and catecholamines will be measured 8 times daily, across all study days (Aim 1). Continuous scalp electroncephalograms (EEG) collected during this period will be analyzed in their entirety at the signal and network levels (Aim 2). Pathological high-frequency oscillations, a promising precursor of seizure activity in the epileptic brain will be estimated and classified across the entire period of recording. Multiscale brain networks and their topological properties will be quantified across all dominant frequencies of continuous EEG signals, and their time-dependent seizure sensitivity and specificity will be assessed. Statistical models will be developed to evaluate the relation between each patient-specific circadian hormone rhythms and corresponding temporal patterns of estimated electrophysiological measures, individually and combined into a seizure risk score (Aim 3). This is a first of its kind study that may significantly improve the field’s understanding of the direct and indirect (through hormonal modulations) impact of seizure precipitants, such as stress, on seizure dynamics from ictogenesis to ictal onset. This new knowledge may have a significant impact on the development of next-generation therapies that need to be guided by patient-specific seizure dynamics. PROJECT NARRATIVE Through repeated hormone measurements and continuous electrophysiological (scalp EEG data), this project aims to systematically investigate the impact of (predominantly stress-related) hormonal fluctuations on the pediatric epileptic brain and their relationships to seizure evolution, from ictogenesis to ictal onset.

"SCH: INT: Collaborative Research: Multimodal Signal Analysis and Data Fusion for Post-traumatic Epilepsy The research objective of this proposal, Multimodal Signal Analysis and Data Fusion for Post-traumatic Epilepsy Prediction, with Pl Dominique Duncan from the University of Southern California, is to predict the onset of epileptic seizures following traumatic brain injury (TBI), using innovative analytic tools from machine learning and applied mathematics to identify features of epileptiform activity, from a multimodal dataset collected from both an animal model and human patients. The proposed research will accelerate the discovery of salient and robust features of epileptogenesis following TBI from a rich dataset, collected from the Epilepsy Bioinformatics Study for Antiepileptogenic Therapy (EpiBioS4Rx), as it is being acquired by investigating state-of-the-art models, methods, and algorithms from contemporary machine learning theory. This secondary use of data to support automated discovery of reliable knowledge from aggregated records of animal model and human patient data will lead to innovative models to predict post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE). This machine learning based investigation of a rich dataset complements ongoing data acquisition and classical biostatistics-based analyses ongoing in the study and can lead to rigorous outcomes for the development of antiepileptogenic therapies, which can prevent this disease. Identifying salient features in time series and images to help design a predictor of PTE using data from two species and multiple individuals with heterogeneous TBI conditions presents significant theoretical challenges that need to be tackled. In this project, it is proposed to adopt transfer learning and domain adaptation perspectives to accomplish these goals in multimodal biomedical datasets across two populations. Specifically, techniques emerging from d,eep learning literature will be exploited to augment data, share parameters across model components to reduce the number of parameters that need to be optimized, and use state-of-the-art architectures to develop models for feature extraction. These will be compared against established pipelines of hand-crafted feature extraction in rigorous cross-validation analyses. Developed techniques for transfer learning will be able to extract features that generalize across animal and human data. Moreover, these theoretical techniques with associated models and optimization methods will be applicable to other multi-species transfer learning challenges that may arise in the context of health and medicine. Multimodal feature extraction and discriminative model learning for disease onset prediction using novel classifiers also offer insights into biomarker discovery using advanced machine learning techniques through joint multimodal data analysis. A significant percentage of people develop epilepsy after a moderate-severe traumatic brain injury. If we can identify who will develop post-traumatic epilepsy and at what time point after the injury, those patients can be treated with antiepileptogenic therapies and medications to stop or prevent the seizures from occurring. It is likely that biomarkers of epileptogenesis after TBI can only be found by analyzing multimodal data from a large population, which requires advanced mathematical tools and models.",SCH: INT:

"Post-surgical resection mapping in epilepsy using convolutional neural networks Project Summary Approximately one third of all individuals with epilepsy continue to have seizures despite treatment with anti- seizure medications. For these people, surgical removal of brain tissue can be a highly effective intervention to reduce or stop seizures. However, there is considerably variability in post-surgical seizure outcomes among individual patients, and the ability of physicians to predict who will benefit from surgery is limited. The location and extent of removed tissue, as well as neuroanatomical structures that are not surgically removed, are important factors that contribute to post-surgical outcomes. The goal of this proposal is to use convolutional neural networks, also known as deep learning, to map both the location and extent of surgically removed tissue on postsurgical MRI scans. The technique will also be used to automatically label brain regions that are spared during the surgical procedure. These computational tools will allow researchers to develop improved methods to predict postsurgical health outcomes. We will develop the automated method by training convolutional neural networks to identify brain regions on MRI scans obtained after epilepsy surgery at the New York University Langone Medical Center. CNNs have been specifically designed for the identification of complex spatial patterns in images and are likely to be well-suited to the identifications of changes in the brain following surgery. Recent developments in computer hardware and analysis methods mean that CNNs can now be applied to high resolution three-dimensional MRI scans. This project will leverage these recent developments in computational image analysis to improve our ability to predict outcomes following epilepsy surgery and therefore contribute to improved treatment for epilepsy patients. Project Narrative This project will use recently developed computational deep learning methods to identify neuroanatomical changes in individuals who have undergone brain surgery for treatment of medically refractory epilepsy.

"Predicting Epilepsy Surgery Outcomes Using Neural Network Architecture Abstract Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is one of the most common forms of pharmacologically resistant epilepsy. The resection or ablation of medial temporal structures can be curative for many patients. Unfortunately, approximately one third of patients who undergo TLE surgery continue to have disabling seizures post- procedurally. The reasons for suboptimal outcomes are not well understood and therefore constitute a very important knowledge gap in epilepsy care. A better understanding of this difference in surgical response phenotype could be used to improve surgical planning, treatment, outcome prediction and counseling. Promising preliminary studies suggest that TLE surgical outcomes can be inferred by neuroimaging computational tools assessing the cumulative degree of abnormalities in the topological organization of structural networks involving limbic and extra-limbic regions. Nonetheless, network abnormalities are not routinely or systematically used and quantified in the pre-surgical evaluation of epilepsies, and their assessment requires refinement and further validation. The purpose of this proposal is to perform a prospective study to test the hypothesis that the degree of limbic and extra-limbic network abnormalities in TLE, systematically assessed using a connectome approach based on optimized diffusion MRI (dMRI), can be used to predict and better understand epilepsy surgery outcomes. This hypothesis builds on the well-defined basic science and neurobiological premises that epilepsy is associated with pathological alterations in networks that are related to seizure onset and seizure propagation. Importantly, network abnormalities are not visible on routine MRI, but their detection using connectomes constitutes a modern approach to quantifying the location and magnitude of “lesional epilepsy,” where broad computational network abnormalities imply worse outcomes. We will prospectively gather clinical and imaging data at six epilepsy centers using the NIH epilepsy common data elements. This project will be fundamentally based on standard of care data, thus minimizing the burden of extra data collection and ensuring feasibility. Furthermore, this project will be embedded in the ENIGMA-Epilepsy framework, which is a collaborative platform for clinical and neuromaging multi-center research. Specific Aim 1 will define the accuracy, reproducibility, and predictive values of the pre-surgical dMRI tractography connectome model towards surgical results in TLE. We will perform hypothesis-driven tests of specific limbic and extra-limbic networks in relationship with clinical data and surgical outcomes. Specific Aim 2 will test if the neuroimaging-clinical outcome model can be further improved with advanced diffusion methods (multi-shell diffusional kurtosis imaging), resting state functional MRI networks, or a multimodal approach. We believe that this research will have an important impact on our understanding of the mechanisms related to TLE treatment. NARRATIVE While some patients can become seizure free with epilepsy surgery, others persist with disabling seizures and the reasons for vastly dissimilar outcomes are not well understood. Increasing evidence suggests that epilepsy-related neuronal network reorganization is at the core of the mechanisms underlying epilepsy severity and seizure control. This project will use individualized mapping of white matter neural networks to better understand the pathophysiology of epilepsy, identify reasons for treatment success, and guide strategies to improve surgical treatment.",Predicting Epilepsy Surgery Outcomes Using Neural Network Architecture,9994414,R01NS110347,"['Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Mapping ', ' Counseling ', ' Data Collection ', ' Diffusion ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Electrocoagulation ', ' Electrocautery ', ' Endocavitary Fulguration ', ' Fulguration ', ' Galvanocautery ', ' Surgical Diathermy ', ' Thermocoagulation ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Tonic-Clonic Epilepsy ', ' Grand Mal Convulsions ', ' Grand Mal Epilepsy ', ' Grand Mal Seizure Disorder ', ' Major Epilepsy ', ' Major Motor Seizure Disorder ', ' Tonic Clonic Convulsions ', ' Tonic Clonic Seizure Disorder ', ' Tonic-Clonic Convulsion Disorder ', ' Tonic-Clonic Convulsion Syndrome ', ' Tonic-Clonic Seizure Syndrome ', ' Temporal Lobe Epilepsy ', ' Freedom ', ' Liberty ', ' Future ', ' gray matter ', ' substantia grisea ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Scalp structure ', ' Scalp ', ' Seizures ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' Thalamus ', ' thalamic ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Medial ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Refractory ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Lesion ', ' Fiber ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Functional disorder ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' millimeter ', ' Severities ', ' Contralateral ', ' Location ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Ablation ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' neuronal circuit ', ' neuronal circuitry ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' substantia alba ', ' white matter ', ' Organization Charts ', ' organizational structure ', ' Modality ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Refractory epilepsy ', ' drug-resistant epilepsy ', ' Intractable Epilepsy ', ' Anterior Temporal Lobectomy ', ' DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) ', ' DWI-MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion weighted imaging ', ' Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' dMRI ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Validation ', ' Pathologic ', ' Common Data Element ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' hippocampal atropy ', ' hippocampal atrophy ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' resistant ', ' Resistance ', ' multi-modality ', ' multimodality ', ' standard of care ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' outcome prediction ', ' connectome ', ' Prospective cohort ', ' tractography ', ' recruit ', ' surgical outcome ', ' surgery outcome ', ' neural network ', ' neural net architecture ', ' neural network architecture ', ' ']",NINDS,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R01,2020,646134,SC-01,0.356870430052695
"Dynamics of long range network interactions  in focal epilepsy PROJECT SUMMARY Epilepsy is the world’s most prominent serious brain disorder, affecting nearly 50 million people worldwide. For about 30% of these patients, seizures remain poorly controlled despite optimal medical management, with attendant effects on health and quality of life. In order to enable advances in the therapeutic management of epilepsy, a thorough understanding of how cellular processes that drive seizures are linked to large-scale network effects is needed. While seizures impact large brain areas and often multiple lobes, the driving processes span regions on the scale of millimeters. These have been well characterized in animal models, but the relevance to human seizures, i.e. how seizures are driven by brain signals from small-scale processes remains unclear. Instead, the view that naturally-occurring seizures may be attributable instead to large-scale neural mass effects (i.e., the epileptic network) is a subject of ongoing debate. Previously, we defined a key role for surround inhibition in shaping EEG recordings of seizures at the onset site and on small spatial scales. We now propose that surround inhibition has a dual role. On a millimeter scale, its abrupt failure permits the advance of a seizure. At long distances from the seizure focus, strong local inhibition serves to mask the excitatory effects of seizures and may help to hasten seizure termination, while weakened inhibition may permit emergence of ictal activity at a distant, noncontiguous seizure site. Multiple seizure foci may go unrecognized with standard EEG interpretation methods, and are likely a critical factor in epilepsy surgery failures. We hypothesize that once established, multiple ictal generators behave as delay-coupled oscillators, demonstrating activity that is synchronized or even temporally reversed. This results in complex and at times counterintuitive network behavior that can be challenging to reverse engineer from EEG recordings. Typically, however, even intracranial EEG recordings provide only a limited view of neural activity. In this project, an interdisciplinary research group with combined expertise in epilepsy, clinical neurophysiology, computational modeling, and mathematics will conduct a comprehensive study of the neuronal contributors to epileptic networks utilizing a unique combined dataset of simultaneous microelectrode and macroelectrode recordings of human seizures. Using a machine learning approach, we will apply this information to develop a multivariate EEG biomarker based on the inferred source of EEG discharges, high frequency oscillations, and very low frequency (DC) shifts and assess its predictive value for post-resection surgical outcome. We anticipate that the project will lead to a theoretical framework for rational development of innovative strategies for developing interventions to control seizures. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project aims to identify the cellular mechanisms of epileptic networks, a critical barrier to developing treatments based on epileptic network analysis and manipulation. An interdisciplinary team of researchers will address this problem by analyzing and modeling multiscale voltage data from epilepsy patients, and utilizing the results to develop a new multivariate biomarker for seizure-generating brain areas.",Dynamics of long range network interactions  in focal epilepsy,9972766,R01NS084142,"['Affect ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Biophysics ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Decision Making ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Engineering ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Partial Epilepsies ', ' Focal Epilepsy ', ' Focal Seizure Disorder ', ' Localization-Related Epilepsy ', ' Partial Seizure Disorder ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' High Frequency Oscillation ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' In Vitro ', ' Incidence ', ' Masks ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Methods ', ' Microelectrodes ', ' Miniaturized Electrodes ', ' Study models ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Terminology ', ' Patients ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Seizures ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' Universities ', ' Weight ', ' Generations ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Failure ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Shapes ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' millimeter ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Distant ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' voltage ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Impact Seizures ', ' partial seizure ', ' Focal Seizure ', ' lobes ', ' Lobe ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Collection ', ' Pathologic ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' multiscale modeling ', ' multi-scale modeling ', ' Coupled ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' parallel computation ', ' parallel computing ', ' parallel computer ', ' minimally invasive ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' surgical outcome ', ' surgery outcome ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' Computer Models ', ' support vector machine ', ' ']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,615913,NY-13,0.4294919733288242
"Automated Phenotyping in Epilepsy There are 65 million people worldwide with epilepsy and 150,000 new cases of epilepsy are diagnosed in the US annually. However, treatment options for epilepsy remain inadequate, with many patients suffering from treatment-resistant seizures, cognitive comorbidities and the negative side effects of treatment. A major obstacle to progress towards the development of new therapies is the fact that preclinical epilepsy research typically requires labor-intensive and expensive 24/7 video-EEG monitoring of seizures that rests on the subjective scoring of seizure phenotypes by human observers (as exemplified by the widely used Racine scale of behavioral seizures). Recently, the Datta lab showed that complex animal behaviors are structured in stereotyped modules (“syllables”) at sub-second timescales and arranged according to specific rules (“grammar”). These syllables can be detected without observer bias using a method called motion sequencing (MoSeq) that employs video imaging with a 3D camera combined with artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted video analysis to characterize behavior. Through collaboration between the Soltesz and Datta labs, exciting data were obtained that demonstrated that MoSeq can be adapted for epilepsy research to perform objective, inexpensive and automated phenotyping of mice in a mouse model of chronic temporal lobe epilepsy. Here we propose to test and improve MoSeq further to address long-standing, fundamental challenges in epilepsy research. This includes the development of an objective alternative to the Racine scale, testing of MoSeq as an automated anti-epileptic drug (AED) screening method, and the development of human observer- independent behavioral biomarkers for seizures, epileptogenesis, and cognitive comorbidities. In addition, we plan to dramatically extend the epilepsy-related capabilities of MoSeq to include the automated tracking of finer-scale body parts (e.g., forelimb and facial clonus) that are not possible with the current approach. Finally, we propose to develop the analysis pipeline for MoSeq into a form that is intuitive, inexpensive, user-friendly and thus easily sharable with the research community. We anticipate that these results will have a potentially transformative effect on the field by demonstrating the feasibility and power of automated, objective, user- independent, inexpensive analysis of both acquired and genetic epilepsy phenotypes.

"Tracking pre-seizure dynamics to predict and control seizures Epileptic seizures are unpredictable events that significantly reduce quality of life. Predicting when the next seizure would occur could both prepare persons with epilepsy and their caregivers, and potentially aid in the treatment of seizures. Animal models of epilepsy provide an opportunity to explore the nature of brain activity in the period leading up to seizures. Using both mouse and rat models of generalized absence epilepsy, we have found a specific build up of thalamic neural spiking activity for several seconds before each seizure. This novel electrophysiological signature occurs in the absence of any overt epileptiform EEG activity. We propose to identify the neural circuits that are responsible for pre-seizure activity using high-density multi-channel silicon probes to record broadly across seizure-generating networks in the mouse. We will also measure calcium ion levels, a readout of neural activity, in neuronal cell bodies and their output axons using fluorescent calcium indicators (GCaMPs) and multiphoton microscopy to capture a highly complementary component of pre-seizure activity with high spatial resolution. Neural activity data will be collected together with EEG, locomotion signals, sensory-evoked responses, and pupil diameter to create a comprehensive multimodal stream of pre-seizure activity. This information will be fed into unbiased machine learning approaches to develop predictive algorithms. We will directly test coupling strength within thalamocortical pre-seizure networks by conducting network-level and targeted single-cell recordings in acute brain slices. To determine a specific role of pre- seizure networks in generating seizures, we will test whether chemogenetic or optogenetic silencing of key pre-seizure network elements reduces seizure incidence or severity. Finally, we will test whether we can use seizure-predictive signals to intervene in real-time and prevent seizures before they take hold. Together, these experiments will provide proof of concept for a novel therapeutic approach: targeting the pre-seizure state to improve seizure control. The unpredictable nature of seizures is a burden on persons with epilepsy and their caregivers. Using animal models of absence epilepsy, we propose to test new methods for a) predicting when the next seizure will occur and b) using this information to prevent seizures from occurring.",Tracking pre-seizure dynamics to predict and control seizures,10122043,R01NS117150,"['Animals ', ' Axon ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Clozapine ', ' Dissection ', ' Electrodes ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Elements ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Absence Epilepsy ', ' Absence Seizure Disorder ', ' Absence Seizures ', ' Childhood Absence Epilepsy ', ' Juvenile Absence Epilepsy ', ' Minor Epilepsy ', ' Petit Mal Convulsion ', ' Petit Mal Epilepsy ', ' Pykno-Epilepsy ', ' Pyknolepsy ', ' petit mal seizure ', ' In Vitro ', ' Incidence ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Locomotion ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Motor Activity ', ' Locomotor Activity ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Persons ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Noise ', ' Oxides ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Pupil ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Rattus ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Rat ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Seizures ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Silicon ', ' Si element ', ' Specificity ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Testing ', ' Thalamic Nuclei ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' Thalamus ', ' thalamic ', ' Time ', ' Virus ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' homotypical cortex ', ' isocortex ', ' neopallium ', ' Neocortex ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Stimulus ', ' awake ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Severities ', ' Event ', ' Stream ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' calcium indicator ', ' Calcium ion ', ' neural cell body ', ' soma ', ' neuronal cell body ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' novel ', ' perceptual stimulus ', ' physicochemical phenomena related to the senses ', ' sensory stimulus ', ' Prevention ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Diameter ', ' Caliber ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Interruption ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Rodent Model ', ' Slice ', ' Preparation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Output ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' Population ', ' Coupled ', ' Coupling ', ' new therapeutic approach ', ' new therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic strategies ', ' new therapy approaches ', ' novel therapeutic approach ', ' novel therapy approach ', ' novel therapeutic intervention ', ' multi-modality ', ' multimodality ', ' efficacy testing ', ' optogenetics ', ' NAV1.6 ', ' NaCh6 ', ' SCN8A ', ' sodium channel, voltage gated, type VIII, alpha subunit ', ' SCN8A gene ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' in vivo two-photon imaging ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' multi-modal data ', ' multi-modal datasets ', ' multimodal datasets ', ' multimodal data ', ' multiphoton excitation microscopy ', ' multiphoton microscopy ', ' ']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,424537,CA-18,0.41682614998888345
"Algorithm for the Real-Time Detection of Absence Seizures from Oculometric Data Abstract Eysz, Inc. is developing an algorithm and software solutions to reliably and affordably detect seizures in an ambulatory setting using existing smart glass technologies. In a proof-of-concept study, Eysz was able to detect >75% of all absence seizures longer than 10 s in duration using only oculometric variables (e.g., pupil size, pupil location, eccentricity, blink frequency) detected using off-the-shelf eye-tracking technology. Eysz seeks to build on this finding by developing and commercializing highly sensitive and specific seizure detection algorithms using eye-movement data as input, with eventual expansion to additional seizure types. This technology has the potential to transform the detection and treatment of seizures for those with epilepsy, one of the most common neurological disorders worldwide. Timely treatment can reduce the chance of additional seizures by half, making early detection and treatment critical. Unfortunately, detection and diagnosis can be difficult using current technologies, especially in types of epilepsy with few observable symptoms such as absence seizures. The gold standard for detecting and characterizing seizure activity is electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring with video and subsequent review by a trained clinician, but this does not translate well to the outpatient setting. While attempts to develop ambulatory EEGs have been made, these have significant drawbacks, including poor patient acceptability, poor detection capability, and continued reliance on asynchronous review. Additional non-EEG- based motion detection devices are limited to tonic-clonic seizures, which are responsible for a small fraction of all seizure activity. Thus, there is a critical need to reliably detect seizures outside of the clinic to provide physicians with necessary information to guide therapeutic decision making. To address this need, Eysz is developing a digital health platform that leverages existing eye tracking technology to meet this significant unmet gap in the market and is technically feasible, capital-efficient, robust, and innovative. Eysz plans to use existing smart glass technology to export the necessary oculometric data to be analyzed by our seizure detection algorithm. We will also build out databases, software systems, and user interfaces enabling the resulting data to be stored in the cloud and visualized/analyzed by physicians. In this Phase I SBIR, Eysz will advance the development of the seizure detection algorithms by: 1) obtaining oculometric video and EEG data on ≥100 absence seizures from multiple patients, and 2) using ML and statistical methods to optimize an algorithm for identifying absence seizures using eye-tracking data, with a target sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 90%. Lessons learned from this study will be applied (with different training sets) to additional seizures types, such as focal impaired awareness (formerly called complex partial) seizures, the most prevalent seizure type in adults. This work is of critical importance to the field, as demonstrated by support from the Epilepsy Foundation and receipt of both the judges' and people's choice awards in the Epilepsy Foundation's 8th Annual Shark Tank Competition. Narrative More than 70 million people worldwide suffer from epilepsy, a debilitating, unpredictable chronic condition that results in significant disability and increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Seizure detection and characterization is critical to choosing an appropriate treatment regimen, and appropriate anticonvulsants can decrease seizures by 50%. Eysz's proposed seizure detection solution will provide unobtrusive, objective, automated detection of seizure activity in an outpatient setting in near real time, improving medical decision- making, decreasing time to treatment, reducing mortality, and ultimately improving quality of life for those with epilepsy.",Algorithm for the Real-Time Detection of Absence Seizures from Oculometric Data,10153499,R43NS119015,"['Activities of Daily Living ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' daily living functionality ', ' functional ability ', ' functional capacity ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anticonvulsants ', ' Anticonvulsant Agent ', ' Anticonvulsant Drugs ', ' Anticonvulsive Agents ', ' Anticonvulsive Drugs ', ' Award ', ' Awareness ', ' Blinking ', ' eye blink ', ' eyeblink ', ' Capital ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Electrodes ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Absence Epilepsy ', ' Absence Seizure Disorder ', ' Absence Seizures ', ' Childhood Absence Epilepsy ', ' Juvenile Absence Epilepsy ', ' Minor Epilepsy ', ' Petit Mal Convulsion ', ' Petit Mal Epilepsy ', ' Pykno-Epilepsy ', ' Pyknolepsy ', ' petit mal seizure ', ' Eye Movements ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Glass ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Motion ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Pupil ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Risk ', ' Seizures ', ' Shark ', ' Specificity ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Work ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' prematurity ', ' premature ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Letters ', ' Therapeutic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' grand mal seizure ', ' Tonic - clonic seizures ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' eye tracking ', ' visual tracking ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Devices ', ' partial seizure ', ' Focal Seizure ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Resolution ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' Monitor ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Electroencephalogram ', ' digital ', ' Advanced Development ', ' software systems ', ' prospective ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' early therapy ', ' Early treatment ', ' commercialization ', ' high risk ', ' Algorithmic Tools ', ' Software Algorithm ', ' Algorithmic Software ', ' improved outcome ', ' wearable electronics ', ' wearable technology ', ' wearable device ', ' death risk ', ' mortality risk ', ' algorithm development ', ' large data sets ', ' large datasets ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NINDS,"EYSZ, INC.",R43,2020,511154,CA-13,0.42372761349285887
"Investigation of Stereotyped High-Frequency Oscillations with Computational Intelligence for the Prediction of Seizure Onset Zone in Epilepsy PROJECT SUMMARY Neurosurgical therapy of refractory epilepsy requires accurate localization of seizure onset zone (SOZ). In clinical practice, intracranial EEG (iEEG) is recorded in the epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU) over many days where multiple seizures are recorded to provide information to localize the SOZ. The prolonged monitoring in the EMU adds to the risk of complications and can include intracranial bleeding and potentially death. Recently, high frequency oscillations (HFO) of iEEG between 80 to 500 Hz are highly valued as a promising clinical biomarker for epilepsy. HFOs are believed to be clinically significant, and thus could be used for SOZ localization. However, HFOs can also be recorded from normal and non-epileptic cerebral structures. When defined only by rate or frequency, pathological HFOs are indistinguishable from physiological ones, which limit their application in epilepsy pre-surgical planning. In this proposal, to the best of our knowledge, we show of a recurrent waveform pattern that distinguishes pathological HFOs from physiological ones. In particular, we observed that the SOZ generates repeatedly a set of stereotyped HFO waveforms whereas the HFOs from nonepileptic regions were irregular in their waveform morphology. Based on these observations, using computational tools built on recent advances in sparse coding and unsupervised machine learning techniques, we propose to detect these stereotyped recurrent HFO waveform patterns directly from the continuous iEEG data of adult and pediatric patients and test their prognostic value by correlating the spatial distribution of detected events to clinical findings such as SOZ, resection zone and seizure freedom. We hypothesize that accurate detection of pathologic HFOs in brief iEEG recordings can identify the SOZ and eliminate the necessity of prolonged EMU monitoring and reduce the associated risks. With these motivations, in this project an interdisciplinary team composed of biomedical engineers, epileptologists and neurosurgeons will work together to develop and test novel computational tools to detect stereotyped HFOs and its subtypes in large iEEG datasets recorded with clinical electrodes. Developed algorithms and iEEG data will be shared with the research community to contribute to the reproducible research and help other research groups to develop novel methods. The results of this study will be essential for achieving our group's long term goal of developing an online neural signal processing system for the rapid and accurate identification of SOZ with brief invasive recording. PROJECT NARRATIVE Prolonged iEEG monitoring for SOZ localization does add to the risk of complications and may include serious issues, such as intracranial bleeding, meningoencephalitis, and eventually death. The intellectual merit of this project is to develop computational intelligence tools based on recent advances in sparse coding and unsupervised machine learning techniques to investigate stereotyped high frequency oscillations (HFOs) in long-term iEEG and test the hypothesis whether the automated detection of HFOs will yield accurate and fast identification of SOZ.",Investigation of Stereotyped High-Frequency Oscillations with Computational Intelligence for the Prediction of Seizure Onset Zone in Epilepsy,9974350,R01NS112497,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Algorithms ', ' Biomedical Engineering ', ' bio-engineered ', ' bio-engineers ', ' bioengineering ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Electrodes ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Environment ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Freedom ', ' Liberty ', ' Goals ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Bleeding ', ' blood loss ', ' High Frequency Oscillation ', ' Hospitals ', ' Laboratories ', ' Language ', ' Meningoencephalitis ', ' Cerebromeningitis ', ' Encephalomeningitis ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Motivation ', ' Motor Cortex ', ' Patients ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Seizures ', ' Spatial Distribution ', ' Stereotyping ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translations ', ' Work ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' homotypical cortex ', ' isocortex ', ' neopallium ', ' Neocortex ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Lesion ', ' awake ', ' Visual ', ' neuro-surgeon ', ' Neurosurgeon ', ' cerebral ', ' Cerebrum ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Multi-center studies ', ' Multicenter Studies ', ' Morphology ', ' tool ', ' Investigation ', ' Hour ', ' Frequencies ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Structure ', ' Nerve Impulse Transmission ', ' Nerve Transmission ', ' Neuronal Transmission ', ' axon signaling ', ' axon-glial signaling ', ' axonal signaling ', ' glia signaling ', ' glial signaling ', ' nerve signaling ', ' neural signaling ', ' neuronal signaling ', ' neurotransmission ', ' novel ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Refractory epilepsy ', ' drug-resistant epilepsy ', ' Intractable Epilepsy ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Motor ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Scheme ', ' Pathologic ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' cost ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' prospective ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical practice ', ' signal processing ', ' child patients ', ' pediatric patients ', ' prognostic ability ', ' prognostic power ', ' prognostic utility ', ' prognostic value ', ' clinically useful biomarkers ', ' clinical biomarkers ', ' computational intelligence ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,R01,2020,459252,TX-18,0.31531665268242187
"Machine Learning Approach to Identify Candidates for Epilepsy Surgery Project Summary/Abstract Despite the widespread adoption of new drug classes to treat epilepsy, approximately one third of patients do not respond to anti-epileptic medication. Patients with drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) suffer permanent memory and cognitive impairment from uncontrolled seizures. Only 8-10% of patients with DRE obtain long-term seizure freedom. About half of patients with DRE are eligible for surgical treatment, which results in seizure freedom in 58-73% of patients. However, it is difficult to determine when patients with DRE need surgery. DRE has a complex disease course that fluctuates according to weekly and monthly patterns. Further, neurologists report that they lack the resources (i.e. time) needed to analyze and interpret large amounts of electronic health record (EHR) data to determine surgical candidacy. This results in substantial delays in treatment - 6 years in pediatrics and 20 years in adults, on average - and contributes to avoidable morbidity and mortality. Automated systems are capable of assisting clinicians in identifying candidates for epilepsy surgery two years earlier in the disease course. One such system uses natural language processing to analyze free-text neurology notes in a real-time clinical setting. This system was able to increase the rate of surgical candidate identification by 46%, but it could still be improved in two important ways. First, the system is not able to incorporate results from EEG and MRIs - the most influential factors on surgical candidacy - into its recommendations. Second, it does not utilize rich information hidden in structured EHR data that captures epilepsy disease burden. A system that fuses information from all three data sources (neurology notes, EEG and MRI reports, and structured data) would drastically improve the accuracy and impact of the model. In the proposed research, I will first develop a deep learning (DL) approach for fusing multi-modal EHR data. Specifically, I will use recent advances in deep representation learning to produce richer features from both free- text and structured data. I will represent free-text in neurology notes and EEG and MRI reports with word embedding vectors, and medication, procedure, and visit codes with medical concept vectors. I will combine disparate data sources with a deep neural network to produce high-level representations of surgical candidacy. This will enable me to estimate patients' risk of future epilepsy surgery. Second, I will establish the generalizability of this approach using a neighboring hospital's EHR data and validate the system in a clinical setting. This contribution will be significant because it will increase the number of surgical candidates identified earlier in the disease course, thereby reducing epilepsy disease sequelae. This proposal will lay the groundwork for nationwide expansion of the DL system and generate the only automated DL system designed to improve the timeliness of surgical referral rates in the adult population. Project Narrative Automating the identification of patients with epilepsy who would benefit from surgical treatment is imperative to reducing morbidity and mortality from uncontrolled seizures. This research proposal will develop and clinically validate a generalizable deep learning framework for analyzing multi-modal electronic health record data to predict epilepsy surgery candidacy. Implementing this system into clinical care is expected to reduce the time to surgery by 45%, which would prevent one epilepsy-related death for every 58 patients who receive surgery.",Machine Learning Approach to Identify Candidates for Epilepsy Surgery,10066989,F31NS115447,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Antiepileptic Agents ', ' Anti-epileptic ', ' Antiepileptic Drugs ', ' Antiepileptics ', ' anti-epileptic agents ', ' anti-epileptic drugs ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Data Sources ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Freedom ', ' Liberty ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Hospitals ', ' Influentials ', ' Learning ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Manuals ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Neurology ', ' Patients ', ' Pediatrics ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' ROC Curve ', ' ROC Analyses ', ' receiver operating characteristic analyses ', ' receiver operating characteristic curve ', ' Savings ', ' Seizures ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Quality-Adjusted Life Years ', ' QALY ', ' Quality-Adjusted Life Expectancy ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Schedule ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' Memory Deficit ', ' memory dysfunction ', ' Memory impairment ', ' Neurologist ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Visit ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' case control ', ' Refractory epilepsy ', ' drug-resistant epilepsy ', ' Intractable Epilepsy ', ' Provider ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Update ', ' Validation ', ' Text ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' Output ', ' vector ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' multi-modality ', ' multimodality ', ' clinical care ', ' electronic structure ', ' candidate identification ', ' Patient risk ', ' prospective test ', ' new drug class ', ' novel drug class ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning ', ' high dimensional data ', ' multidimensional datasets ', ' multidimensional data ', ' automated analysis ', ' structured data ', ' learning classifier ', ' MRI/EEG ', ' magnetic resonance imaging/electroencephalography ', ' ']",NINDS,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,F31,2020,39617,OH-01,0.22394681591251542
