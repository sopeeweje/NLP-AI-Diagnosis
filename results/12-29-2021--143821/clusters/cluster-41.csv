"Stroke Plasticity DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stroke occurs when blood supply to some part of the brain is compromised and can lead to focal motor, language, and general functional deficits important for activities of daily life. Recovery after deficits in stroke patients is linked to bran plasticity changes occurring over time. There is evidence that these plasticity changes can be adaptive as well as maladaptive towards functional recovery and rehabilitation aimed at facilitating adaptive networks and suppressing maladaptive networks may hasten stroke recovery1-7. One way to characterize plasticity changes over time is by utilizing fMRI methods in adults who have suffered an insult (e.g., stroke) resulting in damage to an area typically associated with a specific language or motor function. Studies have shown that these patients show recovery through brain reorganization changes over time where a network of areas are recruited while performing the language or motor function1-7. There are a number of novel stroke rehabilitation treatments aimed at improving recovery. Yet no set guidelines exist on how to utilize these treatments. There is an important need to develop a set of prognostic predictors to make decisions about which patients are appropriate for which treatment, identify a time window that best predicts stroke recovery and therefore ideal for intervention, as well as characterize adaptive and maladaptive brain plasticity changes in order to facilitate faster and more effective rehabilitation. This proposal has three aims: 1) Identify prognostic predictors of  stroke recovery, 2) Identify a time window which best predicts stroke recovery, and 3) Identify adaptive and maladaptive brain plasticity changes involved in stroke recovery. Stroke patients will undergo through neuroimaging and behavioral testing at the acute, subacute and chronic stages. Neuroimaging measures (e.g., fMRI activation) along with clinical measures will be utilized to predict behavior. It is hypothesized that neuroimaging along with clinical measures will predict motor, language, and general functional stroke recovery more accurately than either measure. It is also hypothesized a subacute time window would best predict stroke recovery, given that the most robust plasticity changes occur at this time window. It is hypothesized that that brain plasticity changes assessed by brain measures over time will predict behavioral performance changes over time, characterizing adaptive and maladaptive plasticity networks essential for motor, language, and general functional stroke recovery. Overall this would lead to better prognostic prediction of recovery in stroke patients, identify a critical time window for  intervention, identify adaptive and maladaptive networks involved in reorganization. Subsequently this would allow us to provide individualized treatments based on the prognostics, allow us to intervene at a particular time window for optimal effect, and expand the potential for a range of rehabilitation strategies aimed at facilitating adaptive and suppressing maladaptive networks hastening and maximizing functional recovery. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stroke is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States as well as the leading cause of long-term disability. Each year about 800,000 people suffer a new or recurrent stroke in the United States. 85% of these patients survive and require rehabilitation, making it the leading cause of long-term disability in the U.S. The majority of the  stroke costs(e.g. $57 billion in 2003 to $73.7 billion in 2010 and from 2005-2050 is projected to be $2.2 trillion) are needed for long-term care and rehabilitation (>2/3). Although there are already several rehabilitation techniques aimed at stroke recovery including traditional physical-occupational-speech therapy, novel therapies such as constraint-induced therapy, robot-aided therapy, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), real-time biofeedback, and brain-computer interface treatments, few guidelines exist for these interventions. The recommendations from the 2009 workshop sponsored by the NIH blueprint for neuroscience research heralded the translation of neuroplasticity as key to developing guidelines for effective clinical therapies in rehabilitation. Furthermore, the high prevalence of stroke and the high economic costs associated with it make rehabilitation or reduction of stroke-related disability a national healthcare priority. This research proposal is designed to characterize brain plasticity changes using neuroimaging measures and: 1) identify prognostic predictors in terms of neuroimaging and clinical measures so specific rehabilitation treatment plans can be tailored for a particular patient based on these predictors 2) identify a time window using neuroimaging measures which best predicts stroke recovery where stroke interventions may be maximally effective and 3) characterize the brain networks involved in stroke recovery so interventions can facilitate adaptive networks and suppress maladaptive networks which may lead to faster and more optimal rehabilitation. The results of this study could potentially help in the designing of effectve patient specific rehabilitation plans. The ability to plan patient-specific rehabilitation techniqus for optimal recovery will result in longer productive life-spans for the patients and less burden o the care- givers. This research would lay down the groundwork for utilizing neuroimaging as an objective tool for stroke rehabilitation.",Stroke Plasticity,8593893,K23NS086852,"['functional capacity ', ' functional ability ', ' daily living functionality ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' Activities of Daily Living ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Behavior ', ' Biofeedback ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' indexing ', ' Language ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' extended care ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Methods ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' neuroplasticity ', ' neural plasticity ', ' CNS plasticity ', ' Neuronal Plasticity ', ' Patients ', ' Recommendation ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Physical Health Services / Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Research ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Rest ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Speech Therapy ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' stroke ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' United States ', ' Measures ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' stroke rehab ', ' stroke rehabilitation ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' prognostic ', ' disability ', ' Recovery ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' brain lesion (from injury) ', ' brain damage ', ' Acquired brain injury ', ' Brain Injuries ', ' Staging ', ' Robot ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Transcranial magnetic stimulation ', ' Severities ', ' Scanning ', ' Contralateral ', ' Brain Part ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Occupational ', ' American ', ' Performance ', ' functional recovery ', ' Recovery of Function ', ' treatment planning ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' economic cost ', ' behavioral test ', ' behavior test ', ' Functional impairment ', ' functional disability ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Adverse effects ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' vascular supply ', ' blood supply ', ' Vascular blood supply ', ' Brain region ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Motor ', ' Neurosciences Research ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' poststroke ', ' post stroke ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' stroke recovery ', ' Outcome ', ' brain computer interface ', ' clinical applicability ', ' clinical application ', ' constraint induced therapy ', ' rehab strategy ', ' rehabilitation strategy ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' population aging ', ' aging population ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,K23,2014,190858,WI-02,0.19639232288304542
"Stroke, Brain Networks, and Behavior ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of our research program is to develop new treatments for improving behavioral deficits post-stroke based on a formal theory of brain function and organization. However, the immediate goal of this competitive renewal is to identify patterns of disrupted structural and functional connectivity that are related to stroke-induced deficits, determine how they change during recovery, and see if they predict outcome. Computational theories have proposed that lesions to the brain will have different effects based on the underlying network architecture. Mechanisms controlling recovery of function may similarly depend on network architecture. Specific Aim 1 measures changes in whole brain functional connectivity (FC) after damage to peripheral networks that are mainly connected within the network vs. central networks that communicate more broadly with other brain networks. We measure separately the effect of cortical vs. white matter pathway damage. We predict that peripheral lesions (either to gray or white matter) will produce FC changes that are mainly limited to the affected network, while central lesions (either gray or white matter) will produce multi- network FC changes. Peripheral networks are connected to input/output pathways and mediate predominantly sensory or motor functions. Central networks are connected through association pathways and mediate predominantly attention and memory functions. Specific Aim 2 uses a machine learning ridge regression method to test the idea that sensory-motor deficits and their recovery are more dependent on structural damage and anatomical disconnection, whereas cognitive impairments are better captured by multi-network functional connectivity dysfunction. An important clinical goal of the project is to determine whether advanced neuroimaging techniques, such as structural imaging, DTI, and fMRI can provide useful clinical information on an individual patient's recovery and outcome, over and above that provided by measures of acute behavior, demographic variables, and amount of treatment. In Specific Aim 3 we enter neuroimaging data into a classifier to predict outcome in individual patients, as well as to predict the effect of rehabilitation interventions. Finally, in Specific Aim 4 we move from correlation and prediction to mechanism. Our basic hypothesis is that changes in functional connectivity after focal injury reflect alterations in brain dynamics, specifically a decrease in the variability of inter-regional phase differences. This hypothesis is tested empirically by phase measurements, but also computationally, using a biophysically based model that can simulate the FC changes observed in patients. Importantly, the model also estimates the information capacity of the damaged brain, which we will correlate with the patient's empirically measured degree of modularity and profile of behavioral deficits.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to use advanced neuroimaging techniques to understand how a stroke changes the large-scale physiology of the brain, and how those changes in turn relate to the behavioral problems caused by the stroke. We use techniques that allow us to measure how a stroke damages the connectivity of the brain, both by damaging the fiber bundles that transmit information between brain regions, but also by changing the functional communication across many brain regions. We test hypotheses concerning: 1) how damage to different parts of the brain affect these measures of connectivity; 2) how measures of connectivity can help us to predict the outcome of individual stroke patients; and, 3) whether computational modeling of connectivity can help us understand the behavioral deficits caused by a stroke.            ","Stroke, Brain Networks, and Behavior",9064398,R01NS095741,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Communication ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Goals ', ' substantia grisea ', ' gray matter ', ' hemiparetic ', ' Hemipareses ', ' Language ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' nervous system function ', ' Neurological function ', ' Neurologic function ', ' Nervous System Physiology ', ' Patients ', ' Physiology ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Physical Health Services / Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Research ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' stroke ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' eye field ', ' Visual Fields ', ' Weight ', ' Measures ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' segregation ', ' Mediating ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Peripheral ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Lesion ', ' Fiber ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Measurement ', ' behavioral problem ', ' Problem behavior ', ' brain lesion (from injury) ', ' brain damage ', ' Acquired brain injury ', ' Brain Injuries ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' programs ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Parietal ', ' Sensory ', ' Brain Part ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Spinal ', ' functional recovery ', ' Recovery of Function ', ' neuroimaging ', ' knowledge representation ', ' frame-based representation ', ' computer-based representation ', ' information organization ', ' substantia alba ', ' white matter ', ' motor deficit ', ' memory decline ', ' Memory Loss ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Brain region ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Cognitive ', ' Behavioral ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Output ', ' poststroke ', ' post stroke ', ' neglect ', ' Outcome ', ' visuomotor ', ' visual motor ', ' Impairment ', ' Network-based ', ' network models ', ' impaired behavior ', ' behavioral impairment ', ' public health relevance ', ' network architecture ', ' ']",NINDS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,621558,MO-01,0.10410745890041652

"Comparative Effectiveness of Oral Anticoagulants in Atrial Fibrillation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Atrial fibrillation (AF), a common cardiac arrhythmia, affects >2 million Americans and is associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. Adequate antithrombotic treatment in AF is critical to preventing stroke and other complications. To date, this has been mostly achieved with vitamin K antagonists (warfarin in the US). Warfarin use, however, is burdensome and carries a significant risk of complications. Recently, new oral anticoagulants (OACs; dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban) have proved in randomized trials to be at least as efficacious as warfarin in preventing stroke in AF patients. Randomized trials, however, are not always generalizable to the usual clinical setting. Therefore, additional research is necessary to determine the effectiveness of these new OACs, compared to warfarin, and to identify patients more likely to benefit from the new medications. In this application, we propose to assess the following specific aims: (1) to estimate the effectiveness of new OACs versus warfarin treatment in the prevention of ischemic stroke, systemic embolism, healthcare utilization, and mortality;(2) to assess the risk of bleeding and other complications (myocardial infarction, dyspepsia) associated with use of new OACs versus warfarin in these patients; (3) to identify patient subgroups, defined by age, sex, race/ethnicity, comorbidities, and use of other medications, for which the new OACs are particularly beneficial or hazardous; and (4) to develop and validate risk predictive models of stroke / cardioembolic complications and severe hemorrhage in AF patients using new OACs. To address these research questions, we will use two large claim databases, OptumInsight and MarketScan. These databases include health insurance claims from over 1 million patients with AF, and >155,000 users of new OACs. State- of-the-art methods for comparative effectiveness research, including high-dimensional propensity scores, marginal structural models, and instrumental variables, will be used to adjust for confounding. Results from our research will provide key evidence to help patients and clinicians make decisions about their anticoagulant treatment, balancing benefits and risks associated with different therapeutic options.

"Stroke Plasticity DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stroke occurs when blood supply to some part of the brain is compromised and can lead to focal motor, language, and general functional deficits important for activities of daily life. Recovery after deficits in stroke patients is linked to bran plasticity changes occurring over time. There is evidence that these plasticity changes can be adaptive as well as maladaptive towards functional recovery and rehabilitation aimed at facilitating adaptive networks and suppressing maladaptive networks may hasten stroke recovery.   One way to characterize plasticity changes over time is by utilizing fMRI methods in adults who have suffered an insult (e.g., stroke) resulting in damage to an area typically associated with a specific language or motor function. Studies have shown that these patients show recovery through brain reorganization changes over time where a network of areas are recruited while performing the language or motor function. There are a number of novel stroke rehabilitation treatments aimed at improving recovery. Yet no set guidelines exist on how to utilize these treatments. There is an important need to develop a set of prognostic predictors to make decisions about which patients are appropriate for which treatment, identify a time window that best predicts stroke recovery and therefore ideal for intervention, as well as characterize adaptive and maladaptive brain plasticity changes in order to facilitate faster and more effective rehabilitation.   This proposal has three aims: 1) Identify prognostic predictors of stroke recovery, 2) Identify a time window which best predicts stroke recovery, and 3) Identify adaptive and maladaptive brain plasticity changes involved in stroke recovery. Stroke patients will undergo through neuroimaging and behavioral testing at the acute, subacute and chronic stages. Neuroimaging measures (e.g., fMRI activation) along with clinical measures will be utilized to predict behavior. It is hypothesized that neuroimaging along with clinical measures will predict motor, language, and general functional stroke recovery more accurately than either measure. It is also hypothesized a subacute time window would best predict stroke recovery, given that the most robust plasticity changes occur at this time window. It is hypothesized that that brain plasticity changes assessed by brain measures over time will predict behavioral performance changes over time, characterizing adaptive and maladaptive plasticity networks essential for motor, language, and general functional stroke recovery.   Overall this would lead to better prognostic prediction of recovery in stroke patients, identify a critical time window for intervention, identify adaptive and maladaptive networks involved in reorganization. Subsequently this would allow us to provide individualized treatments based on the prognostics, allow us to intervene at a particular time window for optimal effect, and expand the potential for a range of rehabilitation strategies aimed at facilitating adaptive and suppressing maladaptive networks hastening and maximizing functional recovery. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Stroke is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States as well as the leading cause of long-term disability. Each year about 800,000 people suffer a new or recurrent stroke in the United States. 85% of these patients survive and require rehabilitation, making it the leading cause of long-term disability in the U.S. The majority of the stroke costs(e.g. $57 billion in 2003 to $73.7 billion in 2010 and from 2005-2050 is projected to be $2.2 trillion) are needed for long-term care and rehabilitation (>2/3). Although there are already several rehabilitation techniques aimed at stroke recovery including traditional physical-occupational-speech therapy, novel therapies such as constraint-induced therapy, robot-aided therapy, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), real-time biofeedback, and brain-computer interface treatments, few guidelines exist for these interventions. The recommendations from the 2009 workshop sponsored by the NIH blueprint for neuroscience research heralded the translation of neuroplasticity as key to developing guidelines for effective clinical therapies in rehabilitation. Furthermore, the high prevalence of stroke and the high economic costs associated with it make rehabilitation or reduction of stroke-related disability a national healthcare priority. This research proposal is designed to characterize brain plasticity changes using neuroimaging measures and: 1) identify prognostic predictors in terms of neuroimaging and clinical measures so specific rehabilitation treatment plans can be tailored for a particular patient based on these predictors 2) identify a time window using neuroimaging measures which best predicts stroke recovery where stroke interventions may be maximally effective and 3) characterize the brain networks involved in stroke recovery so interventions can facilitate adaptive networks and suppress maladaptive networks which may lead to faster and more optimal rehabilitation. The results of this study could potentially help in the designing of effectve patient specific rehabilitation plans. The ability to plan patient-specific rehabilitation techniqus for optimal recovery will result in longer productive life-spans for the patients and less burden o the care- givers.

"Stroke, Brain Networks, and Behavior ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of our research program is to develop new treatments for improving behavioral deficits post-stroke based on a formal theory of brain function and organization. However, the immediate goal of this competitive renewal is to identify patterns of disrupted structural and functional connectivity that are related to stroke-induced deficits, determine how they change during recovery, and see if they predict outcome. Computational theories have proposed that lesions to the brain will have different effects based on the underlying network architecture. Mechanisms controlling recovery of function may similarly depend on network architecture. Specific Aim 1 measures changes in whole brain functional connectivity (FC) after damage to peripheral networks that are mainly connected within the network vs. central networks that communicate more broadly with other brain networks. We measure separately the effect of cortical vs. white matter pathway damage. We predict that peripheral lesions (either to gray or white matter) will produce FC changes that are mainly limited to the affected network, while central lesions (either gray or white matter) will produce multi- network FC changes. Peripheral networks are connected to input/output pathways and mediate predominantly sensory or motor functions. Central networks are connected through association pathways and mediate predominantly attention and memory functions. Specific Aim 2 uses a machine learning ridge regression method to test the idea that sensory-motor deficits and their recovery are more dependent on structural damage and anatomical disconnection, whereas cognitive impairments are better captured by multi-network functional connectivity dysfunction. An important clinical goal of the project is to determine whether advanced neuroimaging techniques, such as structural imaging, DTI, and fMRI can provide useful clinical information on an individual patient's recovery and outcome, over and above that provided by measures of acute behavior, demographic variables, and amount of treatment. In Specific Aim 3 we enter neuroimaging data into a classifier to predict outcome in individual patients, as well as to predict the effect of rehabilitation interventions. Finally, in Specific Aim 4 we move from correlation and prediction to mechanism. Our basic hypothesis is that changes in functional connectivity after focal injury reflect alterations in brain dynamics, specifically a decrease in the variability of inter-regional phase differences. This hypothesis is tested empirically by phase measurements, but also computationally, using a biophysically based model that can simulate the FC changes observed in patients. Importantly, the model also estimates the information capacity of the damaged brain, which we will correlate with the patient's empirically measured degree of modularity and profile of behavioral deficits.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to use advanced neuroimaging techniques to understand how a stroke changes the large-scale physiology of the brain, and how those changes in turn relate to the behavioral problems caused by the stroke. We use techniques that allow us to measure how a stroke damages the connectivity of the brain, both by damaging the fiber bundles that transmit information between brain regions, but also by changing the functional communication across many brain regions. We test hypotheses concerning: 1) how damage to different parts of the brain affect these measures of connectivity; 2) how measures of connectivity can help us to predict the outcome of individual stroke patients; and, 3) whether computational modeling of connectivity can help us understand the behavioral deficits caused by a stroke.            ","Stroke, Brain Networks, and Behavior",9150327,R01NS095741,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Communication ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Goals ', ' substantia grisea ', ' gray matter ', ' hemiparetic ', ' hemiparesis ', ' Language ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' nervous system function ', ' Neurological function ', ' Neurologic function ', ' Nervous System Physiology ', ' Patients ', ' Physiology ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Research ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' stroke ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Visual Fields ', ' eye field ', ' Weight ', ' Measures ', ' segregation ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' Mediating ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Peripheral ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Lesion ', ' Fiber ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Measurement ', ' behavioral problem ', ' Problem behavior ', ' brain-injured ', ' brain damage ', ' Acquired brain injury ', ' Brain Injuries ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' programs ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Parietal ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Spinal ', ' functional recovery ', ' Recovery of Function ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' knowledge representation ', ' frame-based representation ', ' computer-based representation ', ' information organization ', ' substantia alba ', ' white matter ', ' motor deficit ', ' memory decline ', ' Memory Loss ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Brain region ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Cognitive ', ' Behavioral ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Output ', ' poststroke ', ' post stroke ', ' neglect ', ' Outcome ', ' visual motor ', ' visuomotor ', ' Impairment ', ' Network-based ', ' network models ', ' behavioral impairment ', ' impaired behavior ', ' public health relevance ', ' network architecture ', ' individual patient ', ' ']",NINDS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,604285,MO-01,0.10410745890041652
"Whole Transcriptome Studies of Patients with Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transient ischemic attacks (TIA) are critical to identify because prevention therapy can reduce the risk of future vascular events by > 50%. Diagnostic testing and therapeutic intervention must start as soon as possible because 10-25% of TIAs have a stroke within 90 days. Because so many patients present emergently with transient neurological events the large majority of whom do not go on to have a stroke, methods for identifying TIAs at high risk for stroke have been sought so that work up and treatment can be targeted to those who need it most to save time, money and limited resources. Though the ABCD2 score and brain Diffusion Weighted Imaging-MRI (DWI-MRI) have improved prediction of which TIAs have a stroke, their sensitivity and specificity for prediction of individual cases i poor. In this proposal we propose that peripheral blood leukocytes and platelets play pivotal roles in which TIAs go on to have a stroke and by assessing RNA in whole blood we can evaluate leukocyte and platelet function in TIA patients who go on to have stroke versus those that do not have a stroke. We hypothesize that specific coagulation and immune genes are activated in TIA patients that predispose them to have a stroke by 90 days compared to those TIA patients who do NOT have a stroke by 90 days. A subset of these leukocyte and platelet mRNA genes will predict TIAs who have a stroke by 90 days. This hypothesis is addressed by the following specific aims. Aim #1 (Derivation Cohort): Demonstrate that mRNA expression measured using RNAseq from whole blood differs in a derivation cohort of TIAs that go on to have a stroke by 90 days compared to those TIAs who do not have a stroke by 90 days. Demonstrate that most mRNA found to be regulated using RNAseq are also significantly regulated when measured using qRT-PCR. Aim #2 (Derivation Cohort): Apply machine learning algorithms to the mRNA from Aim #1 to derive an optimal subset of mRNA regulated by both RNAseq and qRT-PCR that predict which TIAs have strokes by 90 days compared to those who do not with >95% sensitivity on cross-validation. Aim #3 (Validation Cohort): Use machine/prediction learning algorithms to demonstrate that the genes from Aim #2 when measured using qRT-PCR on an independent validation cohort predict which TIAs have a stroke by 90 days with >85% sensitivity. The goal of these studies is to discover mRNA profiles in blood that predict which TIA patients go on to have strokes by 90 days. When confirmed in future studies, this will direct in depth testing to those high risk TIAs most in need in order to prevent strokes, and decrease unnecessary testing in those with low risk of stroke.

"Stroke Plasticity DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stroke occurs when blood supply to some part of the brain is compromised and can lead to focal motor, language, and general functional deficits important for activities of daily life. Recovery after deficits in stroke patients is linked to bran plasticity changes occurring over time. There is evidence that these plasticity changes can be adaptive as well as maladaptive towards functional recovery and rehabilitation aimed at facilitating adaptive networks and suppressing maladaptive networks may hasten stroke recovery.   One way to characterize plasticity changes over time is by utilizing fMRI methods in adults who have suffered an insult (e.g., stroke) resulting in damage to an area typically associated with a specific language or motor function. Studies have shown that these patients show recovery through brain reorganization changes over time where a network of areas are recruited while performing the language or motor function. There are a number of novel stroke rehabilitation treatments aimed at improving recovery. Yet no set guidelines exist on how to utilize these treatments. There is an important need to develop a set of prognostic predictors to make decisions about which patients are appropriate for which treatment, identify a time window that best predicts stroke recovery and therefore ideal for intervention, as well as characterize adaptive and maladaptive brain plasticity changes in order to facilitate faster and more effective rehabilitation.   This proposal has three aims: 1) Identify prognostic predictors of stroke recovery, 2) Identify a time window which best predicts stroke recovery, and 3) Identify adaptive and maladaptive brain plasticity changes involved in stroke recovery. Stroke patients will undergo through neuroimaging and behavioral testing at the acute, subacute and chronic stages. Neuroimaging measures (e.g., fMRI activation) along with clinical measures will be utilized to predict behavior. It is hypothesized that neuroimaging along with clinical measures will predict motor, language, and general functional stroke recovery more accurately than either measure. It is also hypothesized a subacute time window would best predict stroke recovery, given that the most robust plasticity changes occur at this time window. It is hypothesized that that brain plasticity changes assessed by brain measures over time will predict behavioral performance changes over time, characterizing adaptive and maladaptive plasticity networks essential for motor, language, and general functional stroke recovery.   Overall this would lead to better prognostic prediction of recovery in stroke patients, identify a critical time window for intervention, identify adaptive and maladaptive networks involved in reorganization. Subsequently this would allow us to provide individualized treatments based on the prognostics, allow us to intervene at a particular time window for optimal effect, and expand the potential for a range of rehabilitation strategies aimed at facilitating adaptive and suppressing maladaptive networks hastening and maximizing functional recovery. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Stroke is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States as well as the leading cause of long-term disability. Each year about 800,000 people suffer a new or recurrent stroke in the United States. 85% of these patients survive and require rehabilitation, making it the leading cause of long-term disability in the U.S. The majority of the stroke costs(e.g. $57 billion in 2003 to $73.7 billion in 2010 and from 2005-2050 is projected to be $2.2 trillion) are needed for long-term care and rehabilitation (>2/3). Although there are already several rehabilitation techniques aimed at stroke recovery including traditional physical-occupational-speech therapy, novel therapies such as constraint-induced therapy, robot-aided therapy, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), real-time biofeedback, and brain-computer interface treatments, few guidelines exist for these interventions. The recommendations from the 2009 workshop sponsored by the NIH blueprint for neuroscience research heralded the translation of neuroplasticity as key to developing guidelines for effective clinical therapies in rehabilitation. Furthermore, the high prevalence of stroke and the high economic costs associated with it make rehabilitation or reduction of stroke-related disability a national healthcare priority. This research proposal is designed to characterize brain plasticity changes using neuroimaging measures and: 1) identify prognostic predictors in terms of neuroimaging and clinical measures so specific rehabilitation treatment plans can be tailored for a particular patient based on these predictors 2) identify a time window using neuroimaging measures which best predicts stroke recovery where stroke interventions may be maximally effective and 3) characterize the brain networks involved in stroke recovery so interventions can facilitate adaptive networks and suppress maladaptive networks which may lead to faster and more optimal rehabilitation. The results of this study could potentially help in the designing of effectve patient specific rehabilitation plans. The ability to plan patient-specific rehabilitation techniqus for optimal recovery will result in longer productive life-spans for the patients and less burden o the care- givers. This research would lay down the groundwork for utilizing neuroimaging as an objective tool for stroke rehabilitation.",Stroke Plasticity,8989165,K23NS086852,"['functional capacity ', ' functional ability ', ' daily living functionality ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' Activities of Daily Living ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Behavior ', ' Biofeedback ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' indexing ', ' Language ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' extended care ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Methods ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' neuroplasticity ', ' neuroplastic ', ' neural plasticity ', ' CNS plasticity ', ' Neuronal Plasticity ', ' Patients ', ' Recommendation ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Research ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Rest ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Speech Therapy ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' stroke ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' United States ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' stroke rehab ', ' rehabilitation after stroke ', ' stroke rehabilitation ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' prognostic ', ' disability ', ' Recovery ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' brain-injured ', ' brain damage ', ' Acquired brain injury ', ' Brain Injuries ', ' Staging ', ' Robot ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Transcranial magnetic stimulation ', ' Severities ', ' Scanning ', ' Contralateral ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Occupational ', ' American ', ' Performance ', ' functional recovery ', ' Recovery of Function ', ' treatment planning ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' economic cost ', ' behavioral test ', ' behavior test ', ' Functional impairment ', ' functional disability ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Adverse effects ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' vascular supply ', ' blood supply ', ' Vascular blood supply ', ' Brain region ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Motor ', ' Neurosciences Research ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' poststroke ', ' post stroke ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' stroke recovery ', ' Outcome ', ' brain computer interface ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' constraint induced therapy ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new drugs ', ' new drug treatments ', ' rehabilitation strategy ', ' rehab strategy ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' aging population ', ' population aging ', ' individualized medicine ', ' unique treatment ', ' tailored treatment ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' individualized treatment ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' customized treatment ', ' customized therapy ', ' behavioral plasticity ', ' stroke intervention ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,K23,2016,186344,WI-02,0.19257231323879248
"Comparative Effectiveness of Oral Anticoagulants in Atrial Fibrillation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Atrial fibrillation (AF), a common cardiac arrhythmia, affects >2 million Americans and is associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. Adequate antithrombotic treatment in AF is critical to preventing stroke and other complications. To date, this has been mostly achieved with vitamin K antagonists (warfarin in the US). Warfarin use, however, is burdensome and carries a significant risk of complications. Recently, new oral anticoagulants (OACs; dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban) have proved in randomized trials to be at least as efficacious as warfarin in preventing stroke in AF patients. Randomized trials, however, are not always generalizable to the usual clinical setting. Therefore, additional research is necessary to determine the effectiveness of these new OACs, compared to warfarin, and to identify patients more likely to benefit from the new medications. In this application, we propose to assess the following specific aims: (1) to estimate the effectiveness of new OACs versus warfarin treatment in the prevention of ischemic stroke, systemic embolism, healthcare utilization, and mortality;(2) to assess the risk of bleeding and other complications (myocardial infarction, dyspepsia) associated with use of new OACs versus warfarin in these patients; (3) to identify patient subgroups, defined by age, sex, race/ethnicity, comorbidities, and use of other medications, for which the new OACs are particularly beneficial or hazardous; and (4) to develop and validate risk predictive models of stroke / cardioembolic complications and severe hemorrhage in AF patients using new OACs. To address these research questions, we will use two large claim databases, OptumInsight and MarketScan. These databases include health insurance claims from over 1 million patients with AF, and >155,000 users of new OACs. State- of-the-art methods for comparative effectiveness research, including high-dimensional propensity scores, marginal structural models, and instrumental variables, will be used to adjust for confounding. Results from our research will provide key evidence to help patients and clinicians make decisions about their anticoagulant treatment, balancing benefits and risks associated with different therapeutic options. This proposal also has the potential to inform decisions by regulatory agencies, insurers, health system leaders, and professional organizations in issues such as post marketing approval, reimbursements, and clinical guidelines. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Limited information exists on the ""real-world"" effectiveness of new oral anticoagulants compared to warfarin in the treatment of patients with atrial fibrillation,a common cardiac arrhythmia. The proposed research will provide timely and necessary information to help clinicians and patients make well-founded decisions on the use and choice of oral anticoagulants.

"Sleep apnea after stroke: Implications for screening and treatment ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abstract Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability and a leading cause of death in the US, and results in $21 billion in direct medical costs each year. Stroke disproportionately impacts minorities including Hispanics who have higher stroke risk, poorer outcomes after stroke, and a higher prevalence of post-stroke sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). Declining stroke mortality in combination with the aging US population will result in dramatic increases in the number of disabled stroke survivors, with the largest increases projected among Hispanics. New approaches to improve stroke outcomes are therefore urgently needed, and may be particularly important among Hispanics, the largest US minority population. One critical yet scarcely explored opportunity may exist through identification and treatment of SDB in individuals with stroke. SDB is highly prevalent after stroke, and its presence predicts poor functional outcome and higher mortality. Nonetheless, very few stroke patients are screened or treated for SDB. Little information is available about which patients are likely to have high risk SDB after stroke; the trajectory of SDB in this setting and how to predict it; and almost no data are available for Hispanics. This information may offer opportunities to improve critical post-stroke outcomes and lessen ethnic stroke disparities. Thus, the main goals of the research proposed are 1) develop risk stratification models for post-stroke patients with SDB, 2) provide novel insight into the trajectory that SDB takes after stroke to inform management decisions, 3) inform the design of a subsequent clinical trial that will assess the impact of treatment of high risk SDB on key post-stroke outcomes, and 4) explore a possible treatable cause for worse stroke outcomes in Hispanics. We plan to take advantage of an exceptional opportunity provided by the ongoing Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC) project (R01 NS38916). In this population-based stroke surveillance study in a bi-ethnic community, all acute ischemic stroke patients are interviewed at baseline and followed prospectively for 3, 6 and 12 month outcomes. The current application will add longitudinal SDB assessments to BASIC using a validated portable SDB screening device. SDB severity will be assessed with the apnea/hypopnea index, as well as innovative measures derived from signal analysis. Use of BASIC provides a cost-effective opportunity to expand our knowledge about SDB after stroke in ways that can directly impact clinical care, future clinical trial design, and health disparities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), which affects over half of stroke patients, predicts poor outcomes after stroke. Leveraging the infrastructure of the BASIC project, we propose a longitudinal, population-based study of SDB and stroke outcomes to improve the identification and management of important SDB after stroke, provide critical data to plan future clinical trials, and explore a potential target to reduce an important ethnic health disparity.                ",Sleep apnea after stroke: Implications for screening and treatment,9028400,R01HL126700,"['abstracting ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Aging ', ' Apnea ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Elements ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' individuals with disabilities ', ' disabled people ', ' disabled individual ', ' disabled ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Handicapped ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' indexing ', ' Interview ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' sleep-related breathing disorder ', ' Sleep-Disordered Breathing ', ' Sleep Hypopnea ', ' Sleep Apnea ', ' Sleep Apnea Syndromes ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' stroke ', ' Time ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Resource Allocation ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' disability ', ' Pulse Rates ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Selection Criteria ', ' Funding ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Severities ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Autonomic Dysfunction ', ' acute cerebrovascular accident ', ' acute stroke ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Ischemic Stroke ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Stratification ', ' clinical test ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' Cognitive ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' poststroke ', ' post stroke ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' Neurological outcome ', ' Neurologic outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical care ', ' population based ', ' surveillance study ', ' screening ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' stroke survivor ', ' ethnic health disparity ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2016,767518,MI-12,0.3003594342741688
"Whole Genome RNA Sequencing (RNAseq) of Blood from Patients with Lacunar Stroke Abstract  Lacunar strokes are small infarctions of deep penetrator end arteries that supply deep areas of brain including the basal ganglia, internal capsule, thalamus and pons. The “cause” of lacunar strokes has been controversial. C Miller Fisher was the first to suggest that hypertension was one cause, noting lipohyalinosis (inflammation, fibrinoid necrosis of vessel wall) in smaller penetrating arteries (<200um) occurred only in hypertensives. He also showed, however, that larger lacunar strokes were often associated with microatheroma associated narrowing of larger penetrating arteries. This pathology is now thought to be the most common and associated with lipid abnormalities and diabetes. Moreover, some lacunar strokes are now thought to be associated with intracranial atherosclerosis of the parent artery at the origin of the penetrators. Though lacunar strokes were not traditionally associated with large vessel extracranial atherosclerosis or cardioembolism, there are now a number of cases where lacunar strokes have been associated with large vessel atherosclerosis or cardiac causes. Indeed, in our own recent study we showed that as many as ~50% of small deep infarcts (>15mm in size) were predicted to be due to large vessel atherosclerosis or to cardioembolic disease. It is crucial to identify the correct causes of lacunar strokes because treatments differ: drugs for hypertension vs drugs for lipid abnormalities, surgery for large vessel carotid disease, anticoagulants for cardioembolic disease, and anti-platelet agents for lacunar strokes associated with hypertension or abnormal lipids or diabetes. The biology of lacunar strokes has been studied very little, and there are no accepted biomarkers for lacunar stroke or its causes. Our group, however, has begun to provide novel insights into how the immune and clotting profiles in peripheral blood differ in lacunar strokes compared to large vessel and cardioembolic strokes. We have shown that the immune response in large vessel and cardioembolic cortical strokes is mainly associated with neutrophil genes, whereas the immune response in lacunar stroke associated with hypertension /lipids/ diabetes is associated with inflammatory monocyte-related genes. However, since the preliminary studies were performed on whole blood, there is a great need to study individual immune cell types in these different causes of ischemic stroke. Therefore, in this study we will isolate neutrophils and monocytes in patients with lacunar stroke compared to large vessel and cardioembolic stroke. We will perform RNA sequencing on those cells in the following aims which allows us to measure expression levels of >250,000 alternatively spliced transcripts which are derived from the ~20,000 coding genes.  Specific Aim #1. Use RNAseq to demonstrate that alternatively spliced transcript level expression profiles in monocytes, neutrophils and whole blood differ for subcortical lacunar strokes associated with hypertension, abnormal lipids, diabetes, large vessel atherosclerosis, or cardioembolism compared to each other and compared to matched controls.  Specific Aim #2. Use RNAseq to demonstrate that alternatively spliced transcript level expression profiles for subcortical lacunar strokes with hypertension, lipids or diabetes are associated with monocytes, and differ from cortical large vessel and cardioembolic strokes which are associated mainly with neutrophils.  Specific Aim #3a. Use Support Vector Machine (SVM) to derive the minimum number of transcripts from Aim #1 that differentiate the different causes of lacunar strokes including hypertension, abnormal lipids, diabetes, large vessel atherosclerosis, or cardiac disease. Specific Aim #3b. Use the profiles derived in Aim #3a to predict the cause of lacunar stroke in a second cohort using qRT-PCR to measure expression and SVM to perform predictions with >85% sensitivity and specificity.  Significance: Identifying the causes of lacunar strokes based upon splice variant expression in individual blood cell types is important since it would affect therapy used for secondary stroke prevention. Narrative  This study will perform whole genome RNAsequencing of whole blood, neutrophils and monocytes from patients with lacunar strokes and correlate gene profiles with each cause of lacunar stroke. It will then show the lacunar stroke profiles differ from cortical strokes due to cardioembolism and large vessel atherosclerosis, and the profiles can be used to predict the cause of lacunar stroke in an independent validation cohort of patients which is important because different causes of lacunar strokes require different treatments.",Whole Genome RNA Sequencing (RNAseq) of Blood from

"Quantitative Rehabilitation after Stroke PROJECT SUMMARY Stroke causes significant disability, and recovery is often incomplete. In animal models of stroke, robust upper extremity (UE) motor recovery can be elicited if high doses of functional training are given early. In humans, however, the optimal training dose is unknown, because no quantitative dose-response trials have been undertaken in the first months after stroke. This deficiency stems from a lack of measurement instruments that can accurately and easily quantify UE functional training dose and recovery. To address this gap, this proposal will generate two new measurement tools to enable quantitative stroke recovery research. The first tool (Aim 1) will quantify the number of functional movements made during stroke rehabilitation, measuring UE training dose. The second tool (Aim 2) will quantify the abnormality of movements, measuring UE recovery and response to interventions. We will combine wireless motion capture and computational methodologies to create objective, precise, and user-friendly tools. Inertial measurement units, worn by individuals with stroke and healthy controls performing various activities, will capture upper body motion. In Aim 1, machine learning algorithms will be trained to identify and count functional movements in activities normally practiced during rehabilitation. In Aim 2, functional principal components analysis will quantify movement impairment and compensation in standardized motions. Validity will be determined by correlating tool outcomes with current gold standards. The proposed study will be conducted at New York University, in collaboration with investigators from the NYU Center for Data Science, Columbia University, and Washington University-St. Louis. Each have complementary expertise in machine learning, functional data analysis, and functional movement identification. This K02 Independent Scientist Award will provide the candidate with skill in advanced motion capture and analytical methodologies needed to study stroke rehabilitation and recovery. The career development plan includes personalized tutorials and coursework combined with longitudinal oversight of data analysis, providing an excellent foundation for launching an independent research career. Ultimately, the developed tools have the potential to immediately impact neurorehabilitation research, facilitating the rigorous dose-response trials so critically needed to change clinical practice and improve stroke outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health, because it will enable the precise and feasible measurement of rehabilitation and recovery after stroke. The generated measurement tools will facilitate important stroke recovery research, which is expected to inform stroke rehabilitation practices and reduce the burden of stroke disability.",Quantitative Rehabilitation after Stroke,9430869,K02NS104207,"['Algorithms ', ' Animals ', ' Felis sylvestris catus ', ' Felis domesticus ', ' Felis domestica ', ' Feline Species ', ' Domestic Cats ', ' Cats Mammals ', ' Cats ', ' Felis catus ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Dyskinesias ', ' Abnormal Movements ', ' Dyskinetic syndrome ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Motion ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' New York ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Standardization ', ' stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' base ', ' career ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' stroke rehab ', ' rehabilitation after stroke ', ' stroke rehabilitation ', ' Survivors ', ' Ensure ', ' Compensation ', ' Financial compensation ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Measurement ', ' Development Plans ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' instrument ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Principal Component Analysis ', ' Principal Component Analyses ', ' Radial ', ' Radius ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' experience ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' kinematics ', ' kinematic model ', ' Speed ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Upper Extremity ', ' Upper Limb ', ' Membrum superius ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Independent Scientist Award ', ' K02 Award ', ' wireless ', ' Wireless Technology ', ' stroke recovery ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Impairment ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' user-friendly ', ' Neurorehabilitation ', ' Neuro rehabilitation ', ' stem ', ' motor impairment ', ' movement limitation ', ' movement impairment ', ' clinical practice ', ' motor recovery ', ' Data Science ', ' Data Scientist ', ' ']",NINDS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,K02,2017,208791,NY-12,0.22354528934906645
"A Functional Upper Limb Training and Assessment Tool to Enhance Efficacy and Scalability of Rehabilitation in Ecological Environments ABSTRACT Impairments following stroke make it one of the leading causes of disability. Many individuals with stroke do not recover complete function of the upper limb at time of discharge from clinical services . Moreover, early stage improvements may wane following the cessation of formal therapies. Regaining as much upper limb function as possible is important, as even mild impairments are associated with limitations in daily function and lower health- related quality of life. Thus, finding ways to augment functional mobility is important. The overarching purpose of this project is to use portable technology, affordable for home use, to provide objective feedback on performance of upper limb motor tasks to individuals with residual deficits following chronic conditions such as stroke. Objective feedback serves to better inform the participant of their progress and actively engage them in their rehabilitation, thus encouraging self-management of rehabilitation. Results from a recent survey shows therapists predominantly provide patients with stroke written home exercise programs at time of discharge from therapies. With this static approach, patients have a limited capacity to evaluate their motor performance and no encouragement to refine their movement. Creating automated systems that measure and provide feedback will promote a more proactive approach to maximizing function across the lifespan of individuals with chronic conditions. We propose that coupling smart technology found in readily available smartphones with three-dimensional (3D) printing provides a scalable option to provide feedback in long-term rehabilitation and advances the current standard of care, i.e. written home exercise programs. We will build upon our current research, further developing and validating a novel in-home rehabilitation system using 3D printing technologies, smart devices and machine learning algorithms. Specifically, we will use emerging low- cost 3D printing techniques to augment off-the-shelf smart devices (e.g., smartphones) into functional rehabilitation tools. The built-in sensors and our machine learning apps in smartphones can quantify characteristics of movement and provide actionable feedbacks to users during in-home rehabilitation. We hypothesize that feedback will result in improved functional mobility. We will examine performance changes in common activities of daily living (ADLs) trained with our system. With the portable devices, we are able to go further than reporting the typical time metric and also provide feedback on smoothness of movement represented as a normalized cumulative jerk (rate of change of acceleration) score. This assessment provides information on control of movement, an indication of impairment. Recording normalized jerk over time and across activities is a promising way to assess change in impairment. Overall, this scalable design offers an innovative approach to long-term rehabilitation needs of individuals with stroke. PROJECT NARRATIVE Interventions promoting optimum motor performance across the lifespan are a priority after a neurological insult such as stroke. The proposed research incorporates smart devices and 3D printing to create patient-centered rehabilitation devices that are scalable.

"Whole Transcriptome Studies of Patients with Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transient ischemic attacks (TIA) are critical to identify because prevention therapy can reduce the risk of future vascular events by > 50%. Diagnostic testing and therapeutic intervention must start as soon as possible because 10-25% of TIAs have a stroke within 90 days. Because so many patients present emergently with transient neurological events the large majority of whom do not go on to have a stroke, methods for identifying TIAs at high risk for stroke have been sought so that work up and treatment can be targeted to those who need it most to save time, money and limited resources. Though the ABCD2 score and brain Diffusion Weighted Imaging-MRI (DWI-MRI) have improved prediction of which TIAs have a stroke, their sensitivity and specificity for prediction of individual cases i poor. In this proposal we propose that peripheral blood leukocytes and platelets play pivotal roles in which TIAs go on to have a stroke and by assessing RNA in whole blood we can evaluate leukocyte and platelet function in TIA patients who go on to have stroke versus those that do not have a stroke. We hypothesize that specific coagulation and immune genes are activated in TIA patients that predispose them to have a stroke by 90 days compared to those TIA patients who do NOT have a stroke by 90 days. A subset of these leukocyte and platelet mRNA genes will predict TIAs who have a stroke by 90 days. This hypothesis is addressed by the following specific aims. Aim #1 (Derivation Cohort): Demonstrate that mRNA expression measured using RNAseq from whole blood differs in a derivation cohort of TIAs that go on to have a stroke by 90 days compared to those TIAs who do not have a stroke by 90 days. Demonstrate that most mRNA found to be regulated using RNAseq are also significantly regulated when measured using qRT-PCR. Aim #2 (Derivation Cohort): Apply machine learning algorithms to the mRNA from Aim #1 to derive an optimal subset of mRNA regulated by both RNAseq and qRT-PCR that predict which TIAs have strokes by 90 days compared to those who do not with >95% sensitivity on cross-validation. Aim #3 (Validation Cohort): Use machine/prediction learning algorithms to demonstrate that the genes from Aim #2 when measured using qRT-PCR on an independent validation cohort predict which TIAs have a stroke by 90 days with >85% sensitivity. The goal of these studies is to discover mRNA profiles in blood that predict which TIA patients go on to have strokes by 90 days. When confirmed in future studies, this will direct in depth testing to those high risk TIAs most in need in order to prevent strokes, and decrease unnecessary testing in those with low risk of stroke. Equally as important, the genes discovered to be associated with high risk of stroke in TIA patients will represent potential novel stroke prevention targets. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will examine RNA in blood using RNAseq and qRT-PCR of human subjects with Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs) who have a stroke by 90 days compared to TIAs who do not have a stroke. The regulated mRNA, exons and alternatively spliced transcripts in a Derivation Cohort of TIA patients will be used to predict which TIAs have a stroke by 90 days in a Validation Cohort of TIA patients.",Whole Transcriptome Studies of Patients with Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs),9243329,R01NS097000,"['Algorithms ', ' Alternative RNA Splicing ', ' Alternate Splicing ', ' Alternative Splicing ', ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' atherosclerotic disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' thrombocyte/platelet ', ' Thrombocytes ', ' Platelets Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Platelets ', ' Marrow platelet ', "" Hayem's elementary corpuscle "", "" Deetjeen's body "", "" Bizzozero's corpuscle/cell "", ' Blood Platelets ', ' vascular ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Brain TIA ', ' Transient Ischemic Attack ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Emergencies ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' epileptogenic ', ' epileptiform ', ' epilepsia ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' Epileptics ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Exons ', ' vulnerable plaque ', ' atherosclerotic plaque ', ' atherosclerotic lesions ', ' atherosclerosis plaque ', ' Atheromatous plaque ', ' Atheromatous degeneration ', ' Atheromatous ', ' Atheroma ', ' Arterial Fatty Streaks ', ' Arterial Fatty Streak ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Labyrinthine disorder ', ' labyrinth disorder ', ' Labyrinth Diseases ', ' Learning ', ' Leukocytes ', ' white blood corpuscle ', ' white blood cell ', ' White Cell ', ' White Blood Cells ', ' Marrow leukocyte ', ' Leukocytes Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood leukocyte ', ' Methods ', ' monocyte ', ' Marrow monocyte ', ' Blood monocyte ', ' neutrophil ', ' Polymorphonuclear Neutrophils ', ' Polymorphonuclear Leukocytes ', ' Polymorphonuclear Cell ', ' Neutrophilic Leukocyte ', ' Neutrophilic Granulocyte ', ' Marrow Neutrophil ', ' Heterophil Granulocyte ', ' Blood Segmented Neutrophil ', ' Blood Polymorphonuclear Neutrophil ', ' Blood Neutrophil ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Publishing ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' RNA ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' ROC Curve ', ' ROC Analyses ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Measures ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' Migraine Headache ', ' Migraine ', ' base ', ' human subject ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' peripheral blood ', ' Individual ', ' cerebral ', ' Cerebrum ', ' Whole Blood ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Hour ', ' Immune ', ' Immunes ', ' Event ', ' cohort ', ' release factor ', ' novel ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Meta-Analyses ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' Ischemic Stroke ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' dMRI ', ' Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Diffusion weighted imaging ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' DWI-MRI ', ' DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) ', ' Stroke prevention ', ' prevent stroke ', ' Coagulation Process ', ' Coagulation ', ' Clotting ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR ', ' qRTPCR ', ' Quantitative RTPCR ', ' mRNA Expression ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' Transcript ', ' Validation ', ' Derivation ', ' Derivation procedure ', ' Prevention therapy ', ' prospective ', ' gene discovery ', ' discover genes ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' transcriptome ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2017,569977,CA-03,0.27762883267128713
"Shaping Neural Population Dynamics to Facilitate Learning Project Summary Behavior and cognition emerge from the coordinated activity of populations of interacting neurons. To change behavior we must change the architecture of the network that drives behavior. What are the rules whereby the activity of populations of neurons can change during learning? If we could observe the neural population dynamics that underlie skill learning, we might be able to facilitate learning. This ability may eventually lead to improvements to neurally- based rehabilitation strategies that can facilitate the recovery from stroke.  We will use a neurofeedback paradigm to shape the neural population dynamics that underlie skill learning. To do this, we will record the activity of dozens of neurons in the motor cortex of Rhesus monkey subjects. Animals will control a cursor on a computer screen by generating neural command signals. This is neurofeedback because the animal directly observes a projection of his neural activity, in the form of the movement of the onscreen cursor. This paradigm allows us to study learning simply by perturbing the mapping from neural activity to cursor movement on the screen. Following such a perturbation the animal must discover how to generate new patterns of neural activity that are now appropriate to restore good control of the onscreen cursor.  We will ask two linked questions. First, how does the animal learn to generate new patterns of neural activity? And second, can we facilitate that process? Neurofeedback-based learning offers complementary advantages to arm movements for studying the neural population dynamics that accompany learning. Chieﬂy, only in a neurofeedback paradigm can we be certain that the learning-induced changes in neural activity we observe matter directly for behavior, because only the neurons we record directly impact behavior in this paradigm.  We will test classic theories of skill learning, converted into speciﬁc hypotheses about how neural activity patterns will change throughout the multi-day course of skill learning.  If our neurofeedback-based incremental training schemes do facilitate learning, then this research will inform the work of rehabilitation specialists who work with stroke patients. We (and others) believe that if neurofeedback-based therapies are coupled with standard behavioral therapies for stroke, rehabilitation outcomes will improve. Project Narrative Stroke can be a debilitating condition. Only ﬁfty percent of stroke survivors make a full recovery, and that is usually only after extensive rehabilitation. The recovery from stroke and skill learning are probably closely related. We propose to develop brain-computer interface neurofeedback paradigms to facilitate the learning of new skills. If this is effective in our animal subjects it will provide new avenues to explore for stroke rehabilitation.",Shaping Neural Population Dynamics to Facilitate Learning,9309921,R01HD071686,"['Animals ', ' Behavior ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Cognition ', ' Computers ', ' Electrodes ', ' Exhibits ', ' Goals ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Macaca mulatta ', ' Rhesus Monkey ', ' Rhesus Macaque ', ' Rhesus ', ' Monkeys ', ' Motor Cortex ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Neurons ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Patients ', ' Population Dynamics ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Research ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Specialist ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' stroke rehab ', ' rehabilitation after stroke ', ' stroke rehabilitation ', ' Clinical ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' Recovery ', ' Couples Therapy ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' restoration ', ' behavior change ', ' Performance ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Rehabilitation Outcome ', ' skills ', ' Nervous System Trauma ', ' neurotrauma ', ' Neurological trauma ', ' Neurological Injury ', ' Neurological Damage ', ' Nervous System damage ', ' Nervous System Injuries ', ' neural circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Control Animal ', ' Data ', ' Scheme ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' forging ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' stroke recovery ', ' Outcome ', ' brain computer interface ', ' Population ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' motor learning ', ' locomotor learning ', ' rehabilitation strategy ', ' rehab strategy ', ' functional restoration ', ' restore lost function ', ' restore functionality ', ' restore function ', ' neural patterning ', ' neurofeedback ', ' network architecture ', ' multi-electrode arrays ', ' multielectrode arrays ', ' arm movement ', ' Learning Skill ', ' stroke survivor ', ' high dimensionality ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,453274,PA-18,0.18121355476818618
"Optimizing sensori-motor training post-stroke Project Summary The large variability in lesions, impairment, and responsiveness to training following stroke has hindered the development of principled and cost-effective approaches to neuro-rehabilitation of the upper extremity. Our long-term goal is to develop predictive personalized neurorehabilitation therapy based on large data sets. This proposal is based on a unique opportunity to design and execute a large neuro-rehabilitation cohort study at a relatively low cost. Building on our established US-French collaborations, with interdisciplinary expertise in neurorehabilitation, brain imaging, dynamical systems, and statistical learning, we will predict recovery and individualize therapy with the following novel three-pronged approach. In Aim 1, we will develop a database of clinical and neural patient characteristics, treatments, and outcomes from 500 patients post-stroke receiving upper extremity rehabilitation therapy with the ARMEO Spring device (a gravity compensating exoskeleton) in routine clinical care. Inclusion criteria will be as broad as possible to include patients with a large variety of brain lesions, as assessed by state- of-the-art magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional MRI scans. In aim 2, using the database, we will predict long-term changes in upper extremity outcomes as a function of patient's characteristics and treatment using dynamical models that link motor learning to recovery. The final models will expand and combine previous computational models of motor learning at small time scales with models of recovery at long time scales, and will include mixed effects to accurately predict long-term recovery for individual patients. In aim 3, based on these predictions, we will perform a feasibility study aimed at individualizing upper extremity rehabilitation to maximize recovery. Given a new patient, characterized by a number of baseline characteristics that predict recovery, we will select the schedule of treatment that was the most effective for similar patients in the database. The recovery models and scheduling methods developed in this proposal will provide the basis for future clinical software that suggests timing, dosage, and content of therapy from early clinical data, kinematic performance, and routine scans. Such an approach will transform neurorehabilitation programs because the clinician, patient, and insurance company will be able to determine effective treatments while reducing costs. Inclusion of Children Children and adolescents under the age of 21 will be excluded on scientific grounds. The incidence, etiology and pathophysiology of stroke are quite different in this age range, and inclusion would introduce substantial heterogeneity to the subject pool without providing a large enough sample to inform pediatric stroke care. More importantly, patterns of recovery differ with age, and adding small numbers of subjects with very different recovery from the target population would similarly impede hypothesis testing.",Optimizing sensori-motor training post-stroke,9512137,R56NS100528,"['Accounting ', ' Action Research ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Algorithms ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Hand ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Incidence ', ' Insurance ', ' Learning ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' National Health Insurance ', ' Patients ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rest ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Target Populations ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Schedule ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' dosage ', ' brain visualization ', ' Brain imaging ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' disability ', ' Recovery ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Data Quality ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Collaborations ', ' Gravities ', ' Force of Gravity ', ' Space Models ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' programs ', ' Scanning ', ' Pattern ', ' exoskeleton ', ' exoskeletal ', ' Performance ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' kinematics ', ' kinematic model ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' acute stroke ', ' acute cerebrovascular accident ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Corticospinal Tracts ', ' Upper Extremity ', ' Upper Limb ', ' Membrum superius ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Evidence based practice ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Motor ', ' Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial ', ' multi site clinical trial ', ' multi site clinical study ', ' multi center clinical trial ', ' multi center clinical study ', ' Multi-site clinical trial ', ' Multi-site clinical study ', ' Multi-center clinical trial ', ' Multi-center clinical study ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Clinical Data ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' poststroke ', ' post stroke ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' pediatric stroke ', ' Childhood stroke ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' prospective ', ' 21 year old ', ' twenty-one years of age ', ' twenty-one year old ', ' age 21 years ', ' age 21 ', ' 21 years of age ', ' Impairment ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' Neurorehabilitation ', ' Neuro rehabilitation ', ' motor learning ', ' locomotor learning ', ' inclusion criteria ', ' clinical care ', ' patient population ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' arm ', ' individualized medicine ', ' unique treatment ', ' tailored treatment ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' individualized treatment ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' customized treatment ', ' customized therapy ', ' treatment group ', ' dynamic system ', ' dynamical system ', ' individual patient ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R56,2017,483108,CA-37,0.035577285441763896
"Prediction Model for Incident Stroke for Early Screening of an Individual at Risk of Stroke ABSTRACT Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability in the United States and other developed countries. About 800,000 people in the United States have a stroke each year. The incidence of stroke is expected to increase (due to diabetes, an aging population and a rise in obesity), which is a major public health concern and great economic burden to society. Early identification of people at risk of stroke is important as it allows for better planning and implementation of preventative strategies. A number of risk prediction models have been proposed for stroke using common biomarkers such as lipids, and conventional risk factors including age, gender, history of hypertension and smoking. However, these models do not adequately capture a substantial proportion of persons at high risk of stroke they lack precision (best accuracy is up to 50% by Framingham risk score) in risk estimation and have other limitations. Therefore, it is a necessity to improve the accuracy of a stroke risk prediction model. Therefore, we aim to develop a novel model using retinal vessel features and conventional risk factors which will provide higher accuracy on stroke prediction than the existing models and provide better preventative strategies for the people at risk of stroke. PROJECT NARRATIVE Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability in developed countries. Early intervention and therapy can significantly reduce the risk of stroke. Hence, identification of patients at risk of incident stroke is critically needed to help prevent this life-threatening disease.

"Sleep apnea after stroke: Implications for screening and treatment ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abstract Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability and a leading cause of death in the US, and results in $21 billion in direct medical costs each year. Stroke disproportionately impacts minorities including Hispanics who have higher stroke risk, poorer outcomes after stroke, and a higher prevalence of post-stroke sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). Declining stroke mortality in combination with the aging US population will result in dramatic increases in the number of disabled stroke survivors, with the largest increases projected among Hispanics. New approaches to improve stroke outcomes are therefore urgently needed, and may be particularly important among Hispanics, the largest US minority population. One critical yet scarcely explored opportunity may exist through identification and treatment of SDB in individuals with stroke. SDB is highly prevalent after stroke, and its presence predicts poor functional outcome and higher mortality. Nonetheless, very few stroke patients are screened or treated for SDB. Little information is available about which patients are likely to have high risk SDB after stroke; the trajectory of SDB in this setting and how to predict it; and almost no data are available for Hispanics. This information may offer opportunities to improve critical post-stroke outcomes and lessen ethnic stroke disparities. Thus, the main goals of the research proposed are 1) develop risk stratification models for post-stroke patients with SDB, 2) provide novel insight into the trajectory that SDB takes after stroke to inform management decisions, 3) inform the design of a subsequent clinical trial that will assess the impact of treatment of high risk SDB on key post-stroke outcomes, and 4) explore a possible treatable cause for worse stroke outcomes in Hispanics. We plan to take advantage of an exceptional opportunity provided by the ongoing Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC) project (R01 NS38916). In this population-based stroke surveillance study in a bi-ethnic community, all acute ischemic stroke patients are interviewed at baseline and followed prospectively for 3, 6 and 12 month outcomes. The current application will add longitudinal SDB assessments to BASIC using a validated portable SDB screening device. SDB severity will be assessed with the apnea/hypopnea index, as well as innovative measures derived from signal analysis. Use of BASIC provides a cost-effective opportunity to expand our knowledge about SDB after stroke in ways that can directly impact clinical care, future clinical trial design, and health disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), which affects over half of stroke patients, predicts poor outcomes after stroke. Leveraging the infrastructure of the BASIC project, we propose a longitudinal, population-based study of SDB and stroke outcomes to improve the identification and management of important SDB after stroke, provide critical data to plan future clinical trials, and explore a potential target to reduce an important ethnic health disparity.",Sleep apnea after stroke: Implications for screening and treatment,9195060,R01HL126700,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Aging ', ' Apnea ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Elements ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' individuals with disabilities ', ' disabled people ', ' disabled individual ', ' disabled ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Handicapped ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' indexing ', ' Interview ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Sleep Apnea Syndromes ', ' sleep-related breathing disorder ', ' Sleep-Disordered Breathing ', ' Sleep Hypopnea ', ' Sleep Apnea ', ' stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Time ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Resource Allocation ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' disability ', ' Pulse Rates ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Selection Criteria ', ' Funding ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Severities ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' Population Study ', ' study of the population ', ' studies of populations ', ' population-level study ', ' population-based study ', ' Devices ', ' Autonomic Dysfunction ', ' acute stroke ', ' acute cerebrovascular accident ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' portability ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Ischemic Stroke ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' clinical test ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' Cognitive ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' poststroke ', ' post stroke ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' Neurological outcome ', ' Neurologic outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical care ', ' population based ', ' surveillance study ', ' screening ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' stroke survivor ', ' ethnic health disparity ', ' Risk stratification ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2017,722492,MI-12,0.3003594342741688
"Stroke, Brain Networks, and Behavior ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of our research program is to develop new treatments for improving behavioral deficits post-stroke based on a formal theory of brain function and organization. However, the immediate goal of this competitive renewal is to identify patterns of disrupted structural and functional connectivity that are related to stroke-induced deficits, determine how they change during recovery, and see if they predict outcome. Computational theories have proposed that lesions to the brain will have different effects based on the underlying network architecture. Mechanisms controlling recovery of function may similarly depend on network architecture. Specific Aim 1 measures changes in whole brain functional connectivity (FC) after damage to peripheral networks that are mainly connected within the network vs. central networks that communicate more broadly with other brain networks. We measure separately the effect of cortical vs. white matter pathway damage. We predict that peripheral lesions (either to gray or white matter) will produce FC changes that are mainly limited to the affected network, while central lesions (either gray or white matter) will produce multi- network FC changes. Peripheral networks are connected to input/output pathways and mediate predominantly sensory or motor functions. Central networks are connected through association pathways and mediate predominantly attention and memory functions. Specific Aim 2 uses a machine learning ridge regression method to test the idea that sensory-motor deficits and their recovery are more dependent on structural damage and anatomical disconnection, whereas cognitive impairments are better captured by multi-network functional connectivity dysfunction. An important clinical goal of the project is to determine whether advanced neuroimaging techniques, such as structural imaging, DTI, and fMRI can provide useful clinical information on an individual patient's recovery and outcome, over and above that provided by measures of acute behavior, demographic variables, and amount of treatment. In Specific Aim 3 we enter neuroimaging data into a classifier to predict outcome in individual patients, as well as to predict the effect of rehabilitation interventions. Finally, in Specific Aim 4 we move from correlation and prediction to mechanism. Our basic hypothesis is that changes in functional connectivity after focal injury reflect alterations in brain dynamics, specifically a decrease in the variability of inter-regional phase differences. This hypothesis is tested empirically by phase measurements, but also computationally, using a biophysically based model that can simulate the FC changes observed in patients. Importantly, the model also estimates the information capacity of the damaged brain, which we will correlate with the patient's empirically measured degree of modularity and profile of behavioral deficits. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to use advanced neuroimaging techniques to understand how a stroke changes the large-scale physiology of the brain, and how those changes in turn relate to the behavioral problems caused by the stroke. We use techniques that allow us to measure how a stroke damages the connectivity of the brain, both by damaging the fiber bundles that transmit information between brain regions, but also by changing the functional communication across many brain regions. We test hypotheses concerning: 1) how damage to different parts of the brain affect these measures of connectivity; 2) how measures of connectivity can help us to predict the outcome of individual stroke patients; and, 3) whether computational modeling of connectivity can help us understand the behavioral deficits caused by a stroke.","Stroke, Brain Networks, and Behavior",9305153,R01NS095741,"['Affect ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomy ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' Biophysics ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Communication ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Goals ', ' substantia grisea ', ' gray matter ', ' hemiparetic ', ' hemiparesis ', ' Language ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Nervous System Physiology ', ' nervous system function ', ' Neurological function ', ' Neurologic function ', ' Patients ', ' Physiology ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Research ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' eye field ', ' Visual Fields ', ' Weight ', ' Measures ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' segregation ', ' Mediating ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Peripheral ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Lesion ', ' Fiber ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Measurement ', ' behavioral problem ', ' Problem behavior ', ' brain-injured ', ' brain damage ', ' Acquired brain injury ', ' Brain Injuries ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' programs ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Parietal ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Spinal ', ' Recovery of Function ', ' functional recovery ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' white matter ', ' substantia alba ', ' motor deficit ', ' Memory Loss ', ' memory decline ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Brain region ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Cognitive ', ' Behavioral ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Output ', ' poststroke ', ' post stroke ', ' neglect ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Outcome ', ' visual motor ', ' visuomotor ', ' Impairment ', ' Network-based ', ' network models ', ' behavioral impairment ', ' impaired behavior ', ' public health relevance ', ' network architecture ', ' individual patient ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' ']",NINDS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,587873,MO-01,0.10410745890041652
"Big Data Neuroimaging to Predict Motor Behavior After Stroke PROJECT SUMMARY  Stroke is a leading cause of serious long-term adult disability around the world. Despite intensive therapy, an estimated 2/3 of stroke survivors do not fully recover and are left unable to care for themselves independently. Growing research suggests that rehabilitation is not “one-size-fits-all”; variability among stroke survivors in terms of lesion location, age, gender, time since stroke and more may all affect a person's likelihood of recovery and response to different types of treatments. Personalized rehabilitation medicine to maximize each individual's recovery potential is thus desperately needed. However, in order to develop accurate, robust, and specific predictive models that can determine an individual's recovery potential and response to different treatments, large, heterogeneous datasets are needed. The current best predictors of stroke outcomes are neuroimaging (MRI) and behavioral biomarkers that look at brain structure/function and motor performance at baseline. Generating a large enough dataset of MRI and behavioral data is extremely difficult and expensive for any one site to do on its own. This proposal addresses this problem by generating a large, diverse dataset using a novel meta-analytic approach that harmonizes post-stroke data collected worldwide. In partnership with an international consortium comprised of over 500 researchers who produce the largest-known neuroimaging and genetic studies of over 18 different diseases (ENIGMA Center for Worldwide Medicine, Imaging, and Genomics), I propose to apply ENIGMA's powerful approach to answer critical questions in stroke recovery. Under this K01 career development award, I will develop skills in big data neuroimaging analytics, clinical research, and consortium building through my ENIGMA Stroke Recovery working group in order to ask questions about stroke recovery using a large dataset approach (goal n>3,000). This project has four specific aims: Aim 1 will leverage ENIGMA's existing methodology to develop the infrastructure, optimal methods, and analysis techniques for harmonizing a large dataset of post-stroke MRI and behavioral data. Aim 2 will use this large dataset to identify neural and behavioral biomarkers predicting recovery of motor impairment (e.g., actual arm movement ability) and recovery of function (e.g., ability to perform tasks, such as picking up objects with the affected arm). Aim 3 will use supervised machine learning to generate and fine-tune highly accurate predictive models of the relationship between these biomarkers and recovery of impairment versus function. Lastly, Aim 4 will use unsupervised machine learning techniques to examine shared properties of outliers from the predictive model and determine additional neurobiological mechanisms that may prevent individuals from recovering. This approach has the potential to revolutionize the way that rehabilitation research is validated, to ensure robust, reliable, and reproducible results. The methods developed here could be extended to other domains of recovery (language, gait), to study other predictors of recovery (functional brain activity, genomics), and to other clinical populations to improve rehabilitation overall. PROJECT NARRATIVE The overall goal of this project is to provide personalized, precise rehabilitation medicine to individuals after stroke by developing accurate predictive models that help us detect who will recover and best respond to different types of post-stroke treatments. Using a novel meta-analytic approach, this project will harmonize datasets of brain imaging and behavioral information across sites worldwide in order to develop a large dataset with thousands of participants. Advanced statistical and machine learning techniques will then be applied to this dataset in order to detect robust neural and behavioral biomarkers that can be used to predict stroke recovery and to personalize treatments across diverse populations.",Big Data Neuroimaging to Predict Motor Behavior After Stroke,9292814,K01HD091283,"['Participant ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' functional disability ', ' Functional impairment ', ' Genomics ', ' Corticospinal Tracts ', ' Thick ', ' Thickness ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' International ', ' Motor ', ' Rehabilitation Research ', ' Reproducibility ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Characteristics ', ' Behavioral ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' work group ', ' working group ', ' poststroke ', ' post stroke ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' stroke recovery ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Impairment ', ' Neurorehabilitation ', ' Neuro rehabilitation ', ' functional improvement ', ' function improvement ', ' motor impairment ', ' movement limitation ', ' movement impairment ', ' neurobiological mechanism ', ' treatment response ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' arm ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' precision medicine ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' predictive marker ', ' predictive molecular biomarker ', ' predictive biomarkers ', ' Genetic study ', ' imaging biomarker ', ' imaging marker ', ' motor recovery ', ' arm movement ', ' Data Analytics ', ' stroke survivor ', ' stroke treatment ', ' treating stroke ', ' functional capacity ', ' functional ability ', ' daily living functionality ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' Activities of Daily Living ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Algorithms ', ' Behavior ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Future ', ' Gait ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Language ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Statistical Models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Motor Cortex ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Patients ', ' Physical Medicine ', ' Rehabilitation Medicine ', ' Physiatry ', ' Physiatrics ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Reproducibility of Results ', ' Reproducibility of Findings ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Supervision ', ' Task Performances ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' Injury ', ' improved ', ' brain visualization ', ' Brain imaging ', ' stroke rehab ', ' rehabilitation after stroke ', ' stroke rehabilitation ', ' Left ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Diffuse ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Collaborations ', ' Wolves ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Sensory ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' muscle strength ', ' Performance ', ' Recovery of Function ', ' functional recovery ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' novel ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,K01,2017,133191,CA-37,0.15882888048356572
"Comparative Effectiveness of Oral Anticoagulants in Atrial Fibrillation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Atrial fibrillation (AF), a common cardiac arrhythmia, affects >2 million Americans and is associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. Adequate antithrombotic treatment in AF is critical to preventing stroke and other complications. To date, this has been mostly achieved with vitamin K antagonists (warfarin in the US). Warfarin use, however, is burdensome and carries a significant risk of complications. Recently, new oral anticoagulants (OACs; dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban) have proved in randomized trials to be at least as efficacious as warfarin in preventing stroke in AF patients. Randomized trials, however, are not always generalizable to the usual clinical setting. Therefore, additional research is necessary to determine the effectiveness of these new OACs, compared to warfarin, and to identify patients more likely to benefit from the new medications. In this application, we propose to assess the following specific aims: (1) to estimate the effectiveness of new OACs versus warfarin treatment in the prevention of ischemic stroke, systemic embolism, healthcare utilization, and mortality;(2) to assess the risk of bleeding and other complications (myocardial infarction, dyspepsia) associated with use of new OACs versus warfarin in these patients; (3) to identify patient subgroups, defined by age, sex, race/ethnicity, comorbidities, and use of other medications, for which the new OACs are particularly beneficial or hazardous; and (4) to develop and validate risk predictive models of stroke / cardioembolic complications and severe hemorrhage in AF patients using new OACs. To address these research questions, we will use two large claim databases, OptumInsight and MarketScan. These databases include health insurance claims from over 1 million patients with AF, and >155,000 users of new OACs. State- of-the-art methods for comparative effectiveness research, including high-dimensional propensity scores, marginal structural models, and instrumental variables, will be used to adjust for confounding. Results from our research will provide key evidence to help patients and clinicians make decisions about their anticoagulant treatment, balancing benefits and risks associated with different therapeutic options. This proposal also has the potential to inform decisions by regulatory agencies, insurers, health system leaders, and professional organizations in issues such as post marketing approval, reimbursements, and clinical guidelines. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Limited information exists on the ""real-world"" effectiveness of new oral anticoagulants compared to warfarin in the treatment of patients with atrial fibrillation,a common cardiac arrhythmia. The proposed research will provide timely and necessary information to help clinicians and patients make well-founded decisions on the use and choice of oral anticoagulants.

"Stroke Plasticity DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stroke occurs when blood supply to some part of the brain is compromised and can lead to focal motor, language, and general functional deficits important for activities of daily life. Recovery after deficits in stroke patients is linked to bran plasticity changes occurring over time. There is evidence that these plasticity changes can be adaptive as well as maladaptive towards functional recovery and rehabilitation aimed at facilitating adaptive networks and suppressing maladaptive networks may hasten stroke recovery.   One way to characterize plasticity changes over time is by utilizing fMRI methods in adults who have suffered an insult (e.g., stroke) resulting in damage to an area typically associated with a specific language or motor function. Studies have shown that these patients show recovery through brain reorganization changes over time where a network of areas are recruited while performing the language or motor function. There are a number of novel stroke rehabilitation treatments aimed at improving recovery. Yet no set guidelines exist on how to utilize these treatments. There is an important need to develop a set of prognostic predictors to make decisions about which patients are appropriate for which treatment, identify a time window that best predicts stroke recovery and therefore ideal for intervention, as well as characterize adaptive and maladaptive brain plasticity changes in order to facilitate faster and more effective rehabilitation.   This proposal has three aims: 1) Identify prognostic predictors of stroke recovery, 2) Identify a time window which best predicts stroke recovery, and 3) Identify adaptive and maladaptive brain plasticity changes involved in stroke recovery. Stroke patients will undergo through neuroimaging and behavioral testing at the acute, subacute and chronic stages. Neuroimaging measures (e.g., fMRI activation) along with clinical measures will be utilized to predict behavior. It is hypothesized that neuroimaging along with clinical measures will predict motor, language, and general functional stroke recovery more accurately than either measure. It is also hypothesized a subacute time window would best predict stroke recovery, given that the most robust plasticity changes occur at this time window. It is hypothesized that that brain plasticity changes assessed by brain measures over time will predict behavioral performance changes over time, characterizing adaptive and maladaptive plasticity networks essential for motor, language, and general functional stroke recovery.   Overall this would lead to better prognostic prediction of recovery in stroke patients, identify a critical time window for intervention, identify adaptive and maladaptive networks involved in reorganization. Subsequently this would allow us to provide individualized treatments based on the prognostics, allow us to intervene at a particular time window for optimal effect, and expand the potential for a range of rehabilitation strategies aimed at facilitating adaptive and suppressing maladaptive networks hastening and maximizing functional recovery. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Stroke is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States as well as the leading cause of long-term disability. Each year about 800,000 people suffer a new or recurrent stroke in the United States. 85% of these patients survive and require rehabilitation, making it the leading cause of long-term disability in the U.S. The majority of the stroke costs(e.g. $57 billion in 2003 to $73.7 billion in 2010 and from 2005-2050 is projected to be $2.2 trillion) are needed for long-term care and rehabilitation (>2/3). Although there are already several rehabilitation techniques aimed at stroke recovery including traditional physical-occupational-speech therapy, novel therapies such as constraint-induced therapy, robot-aided therapy, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), real-time biofeedback, and brain-computer interface treatments, few guidelines exist for these interventions. The recommendations from the 2009 workshop sponsored by the NIH blueprint for neuroscience research heralded the translation of neuroplasticity as key to developing guidelines for effective clinical therapies in rehabilitation. Furthermore, the high prevalence of stroke and the high economic costs associated with it make rehabilitation or reduction of stroke-related disability a national healthcare priority. This research proposal is designed to characterize brain plasticity changes using neuroimaging measures and: 1) identify prognostic predictors in terms of neuroimaging and clinical measures so specific rehabilitation treatment plans can be tailored for a particular patient based on these predictors 2) identify a time window using neuroimaging measures which best predicts stroke recovery where stroke interventions may be maximally effective and 3) characterize the brain networks involved in stroke recovery so interventions can facilitate adaptive networks and suppress maladaptive networks which may lead to faster and more optimal rehabilitation. The results of this study could potentially help in the designing of effectve patient specific rehabilitation plans. The ability to plan patient-specific rehabilitation techniqus for optimal recovery will result in longer productive life-spans for the patients and less burden o the care- givers.

"Prehospital and Emergency Room Stroke Diagnosis Using Quantitative Cerebral Hemodynamics Large vessel acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is the leading cause of disability and fourth leading cause of death with approximately 250,000 per year in the United States alone. Although treatments including interventional (stentriever) and pharmaceutical (tPA) exist for large vessel occlusion (LVO), there is not a rapid prehospital tool for diagnoses which guides the use of the correct therapy. Because the time to treatment for stroke is critical, there is a large need for a device which can be used in ambulances and other prehospital environments so that patients are rapidly provided the correct care. Currently, computed tomography angiography (CTA) imaging is the standard of care but its use is limited to the hospital or in some cases multimillion dollar stroke on wheels ambulances which are not practical. There is a significant delay that occurs between stroke onset and diagnosis by the time CTA is performed and read resulting in unnecessary death or disability. More delay occurs when patients need to be transferred to a stroke center because the hospital they are at does not perform interventional therapy. Rapid diagnosis in a prehospital setting will enable patients to be taken to the correct hospital and provide LVO location to surgeons in the operating suite.  As the critical factor affecting cerebral anatomy in AIS patients is the limitation of blood flow to the brain the most likely technology to assist in diagnosis of LVO is one that can measure flow directly. Transcranial Doppler (TCD) has been used to directly measure blood flow velocity since 1982 but it relies on a trained operator skilled in both finding the affected vessel as well as interpreting a complicated waveform. Guidelines already exist for how to diagnose LVO with TCD and hospitals with a trained operator currently use it. However, it’s not used in smaller hospitals, urgent care or ambulance settings due to the training requirements.  This work will revolutionize TCD for stroke diagnosis because it removes the need for a trained operator; key for mass adoption of the technology. TCD is already small and portable so it can easily fit in an ambulance similar in size to an automated external defibrillator. This work will use machine learning techniques we have developed to analyze the morphology of TCD waveforms and provide diagnosis information. The key is the ability to remove the operator variability by understanding how waveform morphology of stroke changes based on depth relative to occlusion so that the need to measure in a precise location is eliminated. Our preliminary results show 95% accuracy for LVO diagnosis but we need to broaden our dataset while updating our algorithms. Phase I will use our FDA Cleared Lucid M1 Transcranial Doppler Ultrasound System to measure confirmed stroke subjects after CTA imaging and update our algorithm. Phase II will use algorithms developed in Phase I with a fully automated TCD system we have developed with investor funding that does not require an operator or trained sonographer. We currently have Western IRB approval and are upgrading usability features of the device for ease of use with minimal training. Large vessel acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is the leading cause of disability and fourth leading cause of death with approximately 250,000 per year in the United States alone. This work will reduce the time to treatment for stroke by developing necessary algorithms to diagnose AIS with a portable ultrasound technology which measures cerebral blood flow velocity.

"Shaping Neural Population Dynamics to Facilitate Learning Project Summary Behavior and cognition emerge from the coordinated activity of populations of interacting neurons. To change behavior we must change the architecture of the network that drives behavior. What are the rules whereby the activity of populations of neurons can change during learning? If we could observe the neural population dynamics that underlie skill learning, we might be able to facilitate learning. This ability may eventually lead to improvements to neurally- based rehabilitation strategies that can facilitate the recovery from stroke.  We will use a neurofeedback paradigm to shape the neural population dynamics that underlie skill learning. To do this, we will record the activity of dozens of neurons in the motor cortex of Rhesus monkey subjects. Animals will control a cursor on a computer screen by generating neural command signals. This is neurofeedback because the animal directly observes a projection of his neural activity, in the form of the movement of the onscreen cursor. This paradigm allows us to study learning simply by perturbing the mapping from neural activity to cursor movement on the screen. Following such a perturbation the animal must discover how to generate new patterns of neural activity that are now appropriate to restore good control of the onscreen cursor.  We will ask two linked questions. First, how does the animal learn to generate new patterns of neural activity? And second, can we facilitate that process? Neurofeedback-based learning offers complementary advantages to arm movements for studying the neural population dynamics that accompany learning. Chieﬂy, only in a neurofeedback paradigm can we be certain that the learning-induced changes in neural activity we observe matter directly for behavior, because only the neurons we record directly impact behavior in this paradigm.  We will test classic theories of skill learning, converted into speciﬁc hypotheses about how neural activity patterns will change throughout the multi-day course of skill learning.  If our neurofeedback-based incremental training schemes do facilitate learning, then this research will inform the work of rehabilitation specialists who work with stroke patients. We (and others) believe that if neurofeedback-based therapies are coupled with standard behavioral therapies for stroke, rehabilitation outcomes will improve. Project Narrative Stroke can be a debilitating condition. Only ﬁfty percent of stroke survivors make a full recovery, and that is usually only after extensive rehabilitation. The recovery from stroke and skill learning are probably closely related. We propose to develop brain-computer interface neurofeedback paradigms to facilitate the learning of new skills. If this is effective in our animal subjects it will provide new avenues to explore for stroke rehabilitation.",Shaping Neural Population Dynamics to Facilitate Learning,9475247,R01HD071686,"['Animals ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Cognition ', ' Computers ', ' Electrodes ', ' Exhibits ', ' Goals ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Macaca mulatta ', ' Rhesus Monkey ', ' Rhesus Macaque ', ' Rhesus ', ' Monkeys ', ' Motor Cortex ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Neurons ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Population Dynamics ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Research ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Specialist ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' stroke rehab ', ' rehabilitation after stroke ', ' stroke rehabilitation ', ' Clinical ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' Recovery ', ' Couples Therapy ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' restoration ', ' behavior change ', ' Performance ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Rehabilitation Outcome ', ' skills ', ' Nervous System Trauma ', ' neurotrauma ', ' Neurological trauma ', ' Neurological Injury ', ' Neurological Damage ', ' Nervous System damage ', ' Nervous System Injuries ', ' neural circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' theories ', ' Control Animal ', ' Data ', ' Scheme ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' forging ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' stroke recovery ', ' Outcome ', ' brain computer interface ', ' Population ', ' neural mechanism ', ' neuromechanism ', ' locomotor learning ', ' motor learning ', ' rehab strategy ', ' rehabilitation strategy ', ' restore lost function ', ' restore functionality ', ' restore function ', ' functional restoration ', ' neural patterning ', ' neurofeedback ', ' network architecture ', ' multielectrode arrays ', ' multi-electrode arrays ', ' arm movement ', ' Learning Skill ', ' stroke survivor ', ' high dimensionality ', ' stroke patient ', ' stroke model ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,441867,PA-18,0.18121355476818618
"Detecting bleeding events using EHRs for prediction in Afib Abstract Atrial fibrillation (AF) affects millions of mostly older Americans. Atrial fibrillation contributes to stroke and weighing stroke risk against risk of bleeding from oral anticoagulants (AC) is central to AF management.

"Whole Genome RNA Sequencing (RNAseq) of Blood from Patients with Lacunar Stroke Abstract  Lacunar strokes are small infarctions of deep penetrator end arteries that supply deep areas of brain including the basal ganglia, internal capsule, thalamus and pons. The “cause” of lacunar strokes has been controversial. C Miller Fisher was the first to suggest that hypertension was one cause, noting lipohyalinosis (inflammation, fibrinoid necrosis of vessel wall) in smaller penetrating arteries (<200um) occurred only in hypertensives. He also showed, however, that larger lacunar strokes were often associated with microatheroma associated narrowing of larger penetrating arteries. This pathology is now thought to be the most common and associated with lipid abnormalities and diabetes. Moreover, some lacunar strokes are now thought to be associated with intracranial atherosclerosis of the parent artery at the origin of the penetrators. Though lacunar strokes were not traditionally associated with large vessel extracranial atherosclerosis or cardioembolism, there are now a number of cases where lacunar strokes have been associated with large vessel atherosclerosis or cardiac causes. Indeed, in our own recent study we showed that as many as ~50% of small deep infarcts (>15mm in size) were predicted to be due to large vessel atherosclerosis or to cardioembolic disease. It is crucial to identify the correct causes of lacunar strokes because treatments differ: drugs for hypertension vs drugs for lipid abnormalities, surgery for large vessel carotid disease, anticoagulants for cardioembolic disease, and anti-platelet agents for lacunar strokes associated with hypertension or abnormal lipids or diabetes. The biology of lacunar strokes has been studied very little, and there are no accepted biomarkers for lacunar stroke or its causes. Our group, however, has begun to provide novel insights into how the immune and clotting profiles in peripheral blood differ in lacunar strokes compared to large vessel and cardioembolic strokes. We have shown that the immune response in large vessel and cardioembolic cortical strokes is mainly associated with neutrophil genes, whereas the immune response in lacunar stroke associated with hypertension /lipids/ diabetes is associated with inflammatory monocyte-related genes. However, since the preliminary studies were performed on whole blood, there is a great need to study individual immune cell types in these different causes of ischemic stroke. Therefore, in this study we will isolate neutrophils and monocytes in patients with lacunar stroke compared to large vessel and cardioembolic stroke. We will perform RNA sequencing on those cells in the following aims which allows us to measure expression levels of >250,000 alternatively spliced transcripts which are derived from the ~20,000 coding genes.  Specific Aim #1. Use RNAseq to demonstrate that alternatively spliced transcript level expression profiles in monocytes, neutrophils and whole blood differ for subcortical lacunar strokes associated with hypertension, abnormal lipids, diabetes, large vessel atherosclerosis, or cardioembolism compared to each other and compared to matched controls.  Specific Aim #2. Use RNAseq to demonstrate that alternatively spliced transcript level expression profiles for subcortical lacunar strokes with hypertension, lipids or diabetes are associated with monocytes, and differ from cortical large vessel and cardioembolic strokes which are associated mainly with neutrophils.  Specific Aim #3a. Use Support Vector Machine (SVM) to derive the minimum number of transcripts from Aim #1 that differentiate the different causes of lacunar strokes including hypertension, abnormal lipids, diabetes, large vessel atherosclerosis, or cardiac disease. Specific Aim #3b. Use the profiles derived in Aim #3a to predict the cause of lacunar stroke in a second cohort using qRT-PCR to measure expression and SVM to perform predictions with >85% sensitivity and specificity.  Significance: Identifying the causes of lacunar strokes based upon splice variant expression in individual blood cell types is important since it would affect therapy used for secondary stroke prevention. Narrative  This study will perform whole genome RNAsequencing of whole blood, neutrophils and monocytes from patients with lacunar strokes and correlate gene profiles with each cause of lacunar stroke. It will then show the lacunar stroke profiles differ from cortical strokes due to cardioembolism and large vessel atherosclerosis, and the profiles can be used to predict the cause of lacunar stroke in an independent validation cohort of patients which is important because different causes of lacunar strokes require different treatments.",Whole Genome RNA Sequencing (RNAseq) of Blood from

"Motor cortex network dynamics driving stroke recovery PROJECT SUMMARY Ischemic stroke is the most common cause of disability in US, with motor impairment being the most common form of disability. Rehabilitation therapies remain a mainstay treatment during recovery, but are not very effective for those with moderate to severe upper extremity weakness. Physical and pharmacologic interventions could become more effective if recovery mechanisms were better understood. The studies proposed here will use cutting-edge techniques to dissect the mechanisms of post-stroke recovery at the level of cortical neuronal networks. The principal investigator (PI) is a board-certified neurologist, and has extensive training in neuroscience, stroke neurobiology, and clinical management of patients with neurological diseases. The long- term goal is to understand relationships between the cortical neural network and the motor behaviors with a focus on motor recovery. The proposed research and career development plans will provide the necessary training, mentorship and experience to launch the PI’s career as a successful, R01-funded clinician-scientist. The PI has recently developed deep learning (a branch of machine learning) tools for automated and unbiased analysis of animal behavioral imaging data. Preliminary data demonstrate that, by using these automated tools, 3D kinematics of paw movements can be obtained during a food pellet reaching task in a head-fixed mouse, distinct neural activity patterns emerge in the primary motor cortex (M1) during motor learning of the skilled reaching, and stroke induces changes in the kinematics of the reaching behavior. In the proposed studies, the following specific hypotheses will be tested: stable neuronal network activity patterns emerge in M1 during motor learning (Aim-1); these M1 activity patterns destabilize after a stroke and sensorimotor disconnection (Aim-2); and new M1 activity patterns emerge after post-stroke task-specific rehabilitation (Aim-3). The PI will use, and be further trained on state-of-the-art techniques to record neural population activity (two-photon calcium imaging), to label and silence projection neurons (retro-AAVs and designer-receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs), and to analyze the kinematics of the behavior (deep learning tools). For this purpose, he has assembled a strong mentorship team with experts in their respective fields: Primary mentor Dr. Peyman Golshani (two-photon calcium imaging and analysis in behaving animals), as well as co-mentors, Dr. S. Thomas Carmichael (stroke recovery research), Dr. Jonathan Kao (neural dynamics analysis in motor cortex), and clinically, Dr. Bruce Dobkin (translational neurorehabilitation). The mentored research will be complemented with course work on state-space methods, biostatistics, bioethics, deep learning, responsible conduct of research, and grant writing; as well as improvement of professional skills by publishing manuscripts, presenting at meetings, and participating in workshops on leadership and management. By the end of K08 award, it is expected that the PI will obtain R01 funding as a clinician-scientist and independent investigator, focused on understanding mechanisms of the neural networks that can be modulated to improve motor behavior after stroke. PROJECT NARRATIVE Understanding the mechanisms of motor recovery will ultimately lead to better therapies for stroke recovery. In the proposed research, we aim to elucidate the motor recovery process by investigating the precise activity patterns of brain cells during skilled reaching movements that will be kinematically analyzed by novel automated tools.

"Smartwatch Monitoring for Atrial Fibrillation After Stroke Project Summary / Abstract Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the world’s most common serious heart rhythm problem and causes 15% of all strokes, a major cause of disability and death among Americans.1 Long-term monitoring for early AF detection and treatment is recommended for many stroke patients, but although existing cardiac monitors are accurate, they suffer from methodologic and cost limitations that preclude their long-term use. In the proposed, “Smartwatch Monitoring for Atrial Fibrillation Real-Time in Stroke,” Study, our overall objective is to enhance paroxysmal AF (pAF) detection by enhancing and testing Pulsewatch, an innovative, smartwatch-based technology for long-term rhythm monitoring of stroke patients. For Aim 1, we embed our state-of-the art AF detection algorithms, interactive messaging to promote adherence, and novel contact and motion noise correction capabilities into a smartwatch to enable near-continuous pulse waveform analysis. We will further refine Pulsewatch through focus groups and a Hack-a-thon with stroke patients and their medical providers. For Aim 2, we will enroll 90 stroke survivors and provide them with a smartphone and smartwatch, both encoded with Pulsewatch. We will compare the performance of Pulsewatch when worn daily for 7 days to conventional 7-day cardiac monitoring for pAF detection. For Aim 3, we will determine the acceptability and usability of Pulsewatch through follow-up interviews and focus groups in 30 randomly selected participants from Aim 2 asked to continue wearing smartwatch daily for an additional 30 days. We will identify patient factors associated with adherence and evaluate the impact of Pulsewatch use on disease-specific quality of life, anxiety, and self- activation among the 30 users compared to 30 stroke patients treated with usual care through baseline and 1- month assessments. Our research will lead to the development of a highly acceptable, enabling cardiovascular monitoring technology designed by, and for, stroke patients that facilitates long-term non-invasive screening for pAF, as well as communication between stroke patients and their medical providers.

"Quantitative Rehabilitation after Stroke PROJECT SUMMARY Stroke causes significant disability, and recovery is often incomplete. In animal models of stroke, robust upper extremity (UE) motor recovery can be elicited if high doses of functional training are given early. In humans, however, the optimal training dose is unknown, because no quantitative dose-response trials have been undertaken in the first months after stroke. This deficiency stems from a lack of measurement instruments that can accurately and easily quantify UE functional training dose and recovery. To address this gap, this proposal will generate two new measurement tools to enable quantitative stroke recovery research. The first tool (Aim 1) will quantify the number of functional movements made during stroke rehabilitation, measuring UE training dose. The second tool (Aim 2) will quantify the abnormality of movements, measuring UE recovery and response to interventions. We will combine wireless motion capture and computational methodologies to create objective, precise, and user-friendly tools. Inertial measurement units, worn by individuals with stroke and healthy controls performing various activities, will capture upper body motion. In Aim 1, machine learning algorithms will be trained to identify and count functional movements in activities normally practiced during rehabilitation. In Aim 2, functional principal components analysis will quantify movement impairment and compensation in standardized motions. Validity will be determined by correlating tool outcomes with current gold standards. The proposed study will be conducted at New York University, in collaboration with investigators from the NYU Center for Data Science, Columbia University, and Washington University-St. Louis. Each have complementary expertise in machine learning, functional data analysis, and functional movement identification. This K02 Independent Scientist Award will provide the candidate with skill in advanced motion capture and analytical methodologies needed to study stroke rehabilitation and recovery. The career development plan includes personalized tutorials and coursework combined with longitudinal oversight of data analysis, providing an excellent foundation for launching an independent research career. Ultimately, the developed tools have the potential to immediately impact neurorehabilitation research, facilitating the rigorous dose-response trials so critically needed to change clinical practice and improve stroke outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health, because it will enable the precise and feasible measurement of rehabilitation and recovery after stroke.

"Data-driven subtyping to find patients with drug interactions leading to stroke Project Summary Stroke is a highly heterogeneous and complex disease and is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Identification of the cause of disease is essential for risk stratification and optimal treatment, but can be difficult, as up to 35% of causes are undetermined by traditional subtyping criteria and very few causative genetic variants have been found. In addition, certain causes may be hidden within the clinical picture of a patient, such as an adverse drug reaction. Using data-driven approaches to analyze the medical records of patients may uncover novel patterns of risk factors and clinical features leading to stroke. The long-term goal of this research is to identify novel subtypes of highly heterogeneous diseases such as stroke and to reduce the genetic heterogeneity of a disease cohort by identifying patients with the same subtype. The objective of this application is to propose a pipeline that applies a data-driven analysis of medical notes to identify novel subtypes of stroke, focus on a subtype caused by an adverse drug reaction or drug pair interaction, validate the subtype in a genotyped study cohort, and look for gene variant enrichment in this cohort. This application’s central hypothesis is that applying deep learning to the electronic health record (EHR) of acute ischemic stroke patients will form subtypes based on more granular information than currently implemented and with reduced genetic heterogeneity by identifying novel patterns of risk factors and clinical picture leading to the stroke. In addition, we hypothesize that at least one subtype will identify patients whose stroke is an adverse drug reaction or drug-drug interaction. To do this, Aim 1 will first identify all acute ischemic stroke patients in the EHR by developing a machine learning classifier trained on structured data in the EHR. Aim 2 will then build and train an unsupervised deep learning algorithm on text from medical notes to identify clusters, or subtypes, of patients with similar clinical pictures. Aim 3 will finally validate reduction in genetic heterogeneity of these cohorts by estimating observational heritability of all subtypes using a tool created in our lab and comparing this with the heritability estimates of subtypes derived from physician-based criteria. It will also focus on a not well-studied subtype, stroke due to an adverse drug reaction or drug-drug interaction, by identifying its enrichment in the novel subtypes, validating this subtype in a study cohort with genotyped data, and finally looking for enrichment of pharmacogenetic variants in this subtype. These aims will generate a computational pipeline that identifies novel subtypes of acute ischemic stroke, enabling improved future genetic studies by reducing genetic heterogeneity of cohorts and improved understanding of the underlying causes of the disease. Project Narrative Stroke is a highly complex disease that is a leading cause of death and severe disability. Identifying the cause of stroke is essential for risk stratification and optimal treatment, but up to a third of cases are of undetermined cause, and very few genetic variants have been identified due to the heterogeneity of the disease. To address this, this research proposal develops a computational pipeline that applies data-driven deep learning to medical notes to identify novel combinations of environmental, genetic, and medical risk factors causing the disease; this tool may clarify the etiology of unknown stroke cases, provide cohorts of patients enriched with similar genetic variants, and be expanded to subtype any disease.",Data-driven subtyping to find patients with drug interactions leading to stroke,9469853,F30HL140946,"['Algorithms ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cerebrovascular Disorders ', ' intracranial vascular dysfunction ', ' cerebrovascular dysfunction ', ' cerebral vascular dysfunction ', ' cerebral vascular disease ', ' brain vascular dysfunction ', ' brain vascular disease ', ' Intracranial Vascular Disorders ', ' Intracranial Vascular Diseases ', ' Cerebrovascular Disease ', ' Brain Vascular Disorders ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Electrocardiogram ', ' Electrocardiography ', ' EKG ', ' ECG ', ' Future ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' blood loss ', ' Bleeding ', ' Learning ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Manuals ', ' Medical Records ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Nervous System Physiology ', ' nervous system function ', ' Neurological function ', ' Neurologic function ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacogenetics ', ' Physicians ', ' Probability ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' Radiology ', ' General Radiology ', ' Research ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Semantics ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Supervision ', ' Technology ', ' United States ', ' falls ', ' forest ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Blood flow ', ' Genetic Heterogeneity ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Complex ', ' Reaction ', ' Pattern ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Categories ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Drug Interactions ', ' Reporting ', ' acute stroke ', ' acute cerebrovascular accident ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' genetic risk factor ', ' inherited factor ', ' Modeling ', ' case control ', ' Ischemic Stroke ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' stroke recovery ', ' Heritability ', ' patient population ', ' population based ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' Genetic study ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' disease heterogeneity ', ' patient subtypes ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subsets ', ' Risk stratification ', ' optimal therapies ', ' optimal treatments ', ' stroke patient ', ' deep learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' ']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,F30,2018,49524,NY-13,0.2067276826053077
"A Functional Upper Limb Training and Assessment Tool to Enhance Efficacy and Scalability of Rehabilitation in Ecological Environments ABSTRACT Impairments following stroke make it one of the leading causes of disability. Many individuals with stroke do not recover complete function of the upper limb at time of discharge from clinical services . Moreover, early stage improvements may wane following the cessation of formal therapies. Regaining as much upper limb function as possible is important, as even mild impairments are associated with limitations in daily function and lower health- related quality of life. Thus, finding ways to augment functional mobility is important. The overarching purpose of this project is to use portable technology, affordable for home use, to provide objective feedback on performance of upper limb motor tasks to individuals with residual deficits following chronic conditions such as stroke. Objective feedback serves to better inform the participant of their progress and actively engage them in their rehabilitation, thus encouraging self-management of rehabilitation. Results from a recent survey shows therapists predominantly provide patients with stroke written home exercise programs at time of discharge from therapies. With this static approach, patients have a limited capacity to evaluate their motor performance and no encouragement to refine their movement. Creating automated systems that measure and provide feedback will promote a more proactive approach to maximizing function across the lifespan of individuals with chronic conditions. We propose that coupling smart technology found in readily available smartphones with three-dimensional (3D) printing provides a scalable option to provide feedback in long-term rehabilitation and advances the current standard of care, i.e. written home exercise programs. We will build upon our current research, further developing and validating a novel in-home rehabilitation system using 3D printing technologies, smart devices and machine learning algorithms. Specifically, we will use emerging low- cost 3D printing techniques to augment off-the-shelf smart devices (e.g., smartphones) into functional rehabilitation tools. The built-in sensors and our machine learning apps in smartphones can quantify characteristics of movement and provide actionable feedbacks to users during in-home rehabilitation. We hypothesize that feedback will result in improved functional mobility. We will examine performance changes in common activities of daily living (ADLs) trained with our system. With the portable devices, we are able to go further than reporting the typical time metric and also provide feedback on smoothness of movement represented as a normalized cumulative jerk (rate of change of acceleration) score. This assessment provides information on control of movement, an indication of impairment. Recording normalized jerk over time and across activities is a promising way to assess change in impairment. Overall, this scalable design offers an innovative approach to long-term rehabilitation needs of individuals with stroke. PROJECT NARRATIVE Interventions promoting optimum motor performance across the lifespan are a priority after a neurological insult such as stroke. The proposed research incorporates smart devices and 3D printing to create patient-centered rehabilitation devices that are scalable.

"Prediction Model for Incident Stroke for Early Screening of an Individual at Risk of Stroke ABSTRACT Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability in the United States and other developed countries. About 800,000 people in the United States have a stroke each year. The incidence of stroke is expected to increase (due to diabetes, an aging population and a rise in obesity), which is a major public health concern and great economic burden to society. Early identification of people at risk of stroke is important as it allows for better planning and implementation of preventative strategies. A number of risk prediction models have been proposed for stroke using common biomarkers such as lipids, and conventional risk factors including age, gender, history of hypertension and smoking. However, these models do not adequately capture a substantial proportion of persons at high risk of stroke they lack precision (best accuracy is up to 50% by Framingham risk score) in risk estimation and have other limitations. Therefore, it is a necessity to improve the accuracy of a stroke risk prediction model. Therefore, we aim to develop a novel model using retinal vessel features and conventional risk factors which will provide higher accuracy on stroke prediction than the existing models and provide better preventative strategies for the people at risk of stroke. PROJECT NARRATIVE Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability in developed countries. Early intervention and therapy can significantly reduce the risk of stroke.

"Sleep apnea after stroke: Implications for screening and treatment ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abstract Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability and a leading cause of death in the US, and results in $21 billion in direct medical costs each year. Stroke disproportionately impacts minorities including Hispanics who have higher stroke risk, poorer outcomes after stroke, and a higher prevalence of post-stroke sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). Declining stroke mortality in combination with the aging US population will result in dramatic increases in the number of disabled stroke survivors, with the largest increases projected among Hispanics. New approaches to improve stroke outcomes are therefore urgently needed, and may be particularly important among Hispanics, the largest US minority population. One critical yet scarcely explored opportunity may exist through identification and treatment of SDB in individuals with stroke. SDB is highly prevalent after stroke, and its presence predicts poor functional outcome and higher mortality. Nonetheless, very few stroke patients are screened or treated for SDB. Little information is available about which patients are likely to have high risk SDB after stroke; the trajectory of SDB in this setting and how to predict it; and almost no data are available for Hispanics. This information may offer opportunities to improve critical post-stroke outcomes and lessen ethnic stroke disparities. Thus, the main goals of the research proposed are 1) develop risk stratification models for post-stroke patients with SDB, 2) provide novel insight into the trajectory that SDB takes after stroke to inform management decisions, 3) inform the design of a subsequent clinical trial that will assess the impact of treatment of high risk SDB on key post-stroke outcomes, and 4) explore a possible treatable cause for worse stroke outcomes in Hispanics. We plan to take advantage of an exceptional opportunity provided by the ongoing Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC) project (R01 NS38916). In this population-based stroke surveillance study in a bi-ethnic community, all acute ischemic stroke patients are interviewed at baseline and followed prospectively for 3, 6 and 12 month outcomes. The current application will add longitudinal SDB assessments to BASIC using a validated portable SDB screening device. SDB severity will be assessed with the apnea/hypopnea index, as well as innovative measures derived from signal analysis. Use of BASIC provides a cost-effective opportunity to expand our knowledge about SDB after stroke in ways that can directly impact clinical care, future clinical trial design, and health disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), which affects over half of stroke patients, predicts poor outcomes after stroke. Leveraging the infrastructure of the BASIC project, we propose a longitudinal, population-based study of SDB and stroke outcomes to improve the identification and management of important SDB after stroke, provide critical data to plan future clinical trials, and explore a potential target to reduce an important ethnic health disparity.",Sleep apnea after stroke: Implications for screening and treatment,9389004,R01HL126700,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Aging ', ' Apnea ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Elements ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' individuals with disabilities ', ' disabled people ', ' disabled individual ', ' disabled ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Handicapped ', ' Disabled Population ', ' indexing ', ' Interview ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Sleep Apnea Syndromes ', ' sleep-related breathing disorder ', ' Sleep-Disordered Breathing ', ' Sleep Hypopnea ', ' Sleep Apnea ', ' Stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Time ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Medical Care Costs ', ' medical costs ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Resource Allocation ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' disability ', ' Pulse Rates ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Selection Criteria ', ' Funding ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Severities ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' Population Study ', ' study of the population ', ' studies of populations ', ' population-level study ', ' population-based study ', ' Devices ', ' Autonomic Dysfunction ', ' acute stroke ', ' acute cerebrovascular accident ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' portability ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Ischemic Stroke ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' clinical test ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' Cognitive ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' poststroke ', ' post stroke ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Outcome ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Neurologic outcome ', ' Neurological outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical care ', ' population based ', ' surveillance study ', ' screening ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized medicine ', ' stroke survivor ', ' ethnic health disparity ', ' Risk stratification ', ' patient screening ', ' stroke patient ', ' risk of stroke ', ' stroke risk ', ' stroke outcome ', ' stroke trials ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2018,734204,MI-12,0.3003594342741688
"Big Data Neuroimaging to Predict Motor Behavior After Stroke PROJECT SUMMARY  Stroke is a leading cause of serious long-term adult disability around the world. Despite intensive therapy, an estimated 2/3 of stroke survivors do not fully recover and are left unable to care for themselves independently. Growing research suggests that rehabilitation is not “one-size-fits-all”; variability among stroke survivors in terms of lesion location, age, gender, time since stroke and more may all affect a person's likelihood of recovery and response to different types of treatments. Personalized rehabilitation medicine to maximize each individual's recovery potential is thus desperately needed. However, in order to develop accurate, robust, and specific predictive models that can determine an individual's recovery potential and response to different treatments, large, heterogeneous datasets are needed. The current best predictors of stroke outcomes are neuroimaging (MRI) and behavioral biomarkers that look at brain structure/function and motor performance at baseline. Generating a large enough dataset of MRI and behavioral data is extremely difficult and expensive for any one site to do on its own. This proposal addresses this problem by generating a large, diverse dataset using a novel meta-analytic approach that harmonizes post-stroke data collected worldwide. In partnership with an international consortium comprised of over 500 researchers who produce the largest-known neuroimaging and genetic studies of over 18 different diseases (ENIGMA Center for Worldwide Medicine, Imaging, and Genomics), I propose to apply ENIGMA's powerful approach to answer critical questions in stroke recovery. Under this K01 career development award, I will develop skills in big data neuroimaging analytics, clinical research, and consortium building through my ENIGMA Stroke Recovery working group in order to ask questions about stroke recovery using a large dataset approach (goal n>3,000). This project has four specific aims: Aim 1 will leverage ENIGMA's existing methodology to develop the infrastructure, optimal methods, and analysis techniques for harmonizing a large dataset of post-stroke MRI and behavioral data. Aim 2 will use this large dataset to identify neural and behavioral biomarkers predicting recovery of motor impairment (e.g., actual arm movement ability) and recovery of function (e.g., ability to perform tasks, such as picking up objects with the affected arm). Aim 3 will use supervised machine learning to generate and fine-tune highly accurate predictive models of the relationship between these biomarkers and recovery of impairment versus function. Lastly, Aim 4 will use unsupervised machine learning techniques to examine shared properties of outliers from the predictive model and determine additional neurobiological mechanisms that may prevent individuals from recovering. This approach has the potential to revolutionize the way that rehabilitation research is validated, to ensure robust, reliable, and reproducible results. The methods developed here could be extended to other domains of recovery (language, gait), to study other predictors of recovery (functional brain activity, genomics), and to other clinical populations to improve rehabilitation overall. PROJECT NARRATIVE The overall goal of this project is to provide personalized, precise rehabilitation medicine to individuals after stroke by developing accurate predictive models that help us detect who will recover and best respond to different types of post-stroke treatments. Using a novel meta-analytic approach, this project will harmonize datasets of brain imaging and behavioral information across sites worldwide in order to develop a large dataset with thousands of participants.

"Prediction Model for Incident Stroke for Early Screening of an Individual at Risk of Stroke ABSTRACT Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability in the United States and other developed countries. About 800,000 people in the United States have a stroke each year. The incidence of stroke is expected to increase (due to diabetes, an aging population and a rise in obesity), which is a major public health concern and great economic burden to society. Early identification of people at risk of stroke is important as it allows for better planning and implementation of preventative strategies. A number of risk prediction models have been proposed for stroke using common biomarkers such as lipids, and conventional risk factors including age, gender, history of hypertension and smoking. However, these models do not adequately capture a substantial proportion of persons at high risk of stroke they lack precision (best accuracy is up to 50% by Framingham risk score) in risk estimation and have other limitations. Therefore, it is a necessity to improve the accuracy of a stroke risk prediction model. Therefore, we aim to develop a novel model using retinal vessel features and conventional risk factors which will provide higher accuracy on stroke prediction than the existing models and provide better preventative strategies for the people at risk of stroke. PROJECT NARRATIVE Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability in developed countries. Early intervention and therapy can significantly reduce the risk of stroke. Hence, identification of patients at risk of incident stroke is critically needed to help prevent this life-threatening disease.

"Enhancing Stroke Prehospital and Emergency Evaluation and Delivery (E-SPEED) Nearly 800,000 people in the United States (US) each year are affected by stroke, which remains the leading cause of adult disability and 5th leading cause of death. Despite the proliferation of stroke centers nationwide, access to timely stroke care and evidence-based therapies is still poor with multiple inefficiencies, redundancies, errors, and system-based barriers that lead to care fragmentation. A stroke system of care that integrates and coordinates care between non-stroke center hospitals, primary stroke centers, and comprehensive stroke centers has been recommended since it would reduce stroke-related deaths by 20,000 annually in the US and nearly 400,000 worldwide. This proposal is significant because it addresses two important gaps in knowledge about the acute evaluation and treatment of stroke patients: prehospital screening errors and delays in inter-hospital transfer. The Enhancing Stroke Prehospital and Emergency Evaluation and Delivery (E-SPEED) study will (1) enhance existing LVO screening tools, assess whether machine learning approaches improve LVO prediction, and evaluate the impact of an Enhanced LVO Screening Tool in the prehospital setting; and (2) use learning collaboratives and simulations to design, implement, and pilot test a new inter-hospital stroke transfer protocol. We bring together systems engineers and stroke health service researchers in a novel collaboration that will produce generalizable knowledge that can be widely applied to other urban regions of the country and provide preliminary data and demonstration of novel approaches that could be evaluated in large-scale comparative effectiveness studies across multiple regions.

"Whole Transcriptome Studies of Patients with Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transient ischemic attacks (TIA) are critical to identify because prevention therapy can reduce the risk of future vascular events by > 50%. Diagnostic testing and therapeutic intervention must start as soon as possible because 10-25% of TIAs have a stroke within 90 days. Because so many patients present emergently with transient neurological events the large majority of whom do not go on to have a stroke, methods for identifying TIAs at high risk for stroke have been sought so that work up and treatment can be targeted to those who need it most to save time, money and limited resources. Though the ABCD2 score and brain Diffusion Weighted Imaging-MRI (DWI-MRI) have improved prediction of which TIAs have a stroke, their sensitivity and specificity for prediction of individual cases i poor. In this proposal we propose that peripheral blood leukocytes and platelets play pivotal roles in which TIAs go on to have a stroke and by assessing RNA in whole blood we can evaluate leukocyte and platelet function in TIA patients who go on to have stroke versus those that do not have a stroke. We hypothesize that specific coagulation and immune genes are activated in TIA patients that predispose them to have a stroke by 90 days compared to those TIA patients who do NOT have a stroke by 90 days. A subset of these leukocyte and platelet mRNA genes will predict TIAs who have a stroke by 90 days. This hypothesis is addressed by the following specific aims. Aim #1 (Derivation Cohort): Demonstrate that mRNA expression measured using RNAseq from whole blood differs in a derivation cohort of TIAs that go on to have a stroke by 90 days compared to those TIAs who do not have a stroke by 90 days. Demonstrate that most mRNA found to be regulated using RNAseq are also significantly regulated when measured using qRT-PCR. Aim #2 (Derivation Cohort): Apply machine learning algorithms to the mRNA from Aim #1 to derive an optimal subset of mRNA regulated by both RNAseq and qRT-PCR that predict which TIAs have strokes by 90 days compared to those who do not with >95% sensitivity on cross-validation. Aim #3 (Validation Cohort): Use machine/prediction learning algorithms to demonstrate that the genes from Aim #2 when measured using qRT-PCR on an independent validation cohort predict which TIAs have a stroke by 90 days with >85% sensitivity. The goal of these studies is to discover mRNA profiles in blood that predict which TIA patients go on to have strokes by 90 days. When confirmed in future studies, this will direct in depth testing to those high risk TIAs most in need in order to prevent strokes, and decrease unnecessary testing in those with low risk of stroke. Equally as important, the genes discovered to be associated with high risk of stroke in TIA patients will represent potential novel stroke prevention targets. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will examine RNA in blood using RNAseq and qRT-PCR of human subjects with Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs) who have a stroke by 90 days compared to TIAs who do not have a stroke. The regulated mRNA, exons and alternatively spliced transcripts in a Derivation Cohort of TIA patients will be used to predict which TIAs have a stroke by 90 days in a Validation Cohort of TIA patients.",Whole Transcriptome Studies of Patients with Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs),9441869,R01NS097000,"['Algorithms ', ' Alternative Splicing ', ' Alternative RNA Splicing ', ' Alternate Splicing ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' atherosclerotic disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood Platelets ', ' thrombocyte/platelet ', ' Thrombocytes ', ' Platelets Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Platelets ', ' Marrow platelet ', "" Hayem's elementary corpuscle "", "" Deetjeen's body "", "" Bizzozero's corpuscle/cell "", ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Transient Ischemic Attack ', ' Brain TIA ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Epilepsy ', ' epileptogenic ', ' epileptiform ', ' epilepsia ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' Epileptics ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Exons ', ' Arterial Fatty Streak ', ' vulnerable plaque ', ' atherosclerotic plaque ', ' atherosclerotic lesions ', ' atherosclerosis plaque ', ' Atheromatous plaque ', ' Atheromatous degeneration ', ' Atheromatous ', ' Atheroma ', ' Arterial Fatty Streaks ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Labyrinthine disorder ', ' labyrinth disorder ', ' Labyrinth Diseases ', ' Learning ', ' Leukocytes ', ' white blood corpuscle ', ' white blood cell ', ' White Cell ', ' White Blood Cells ', ' Marrow leukocyte ', ' Leukocytes Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood leukocyte ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' monocyte ', ' Marrow monocyte ', ' Blood monocyte ', ' neutrophil ', ' Polymorphonuclear Neutrophils ', ' Polymorphonuclear Leukocytes ', ' Polymorphonuclear Cell ', ' Neutrophilic Leukocyte ', ' Neutrophilic Granulocyte ', ' Marrow Neutrophil ', ' Heterophil Granulocyte ', ' Blood Segmented Neutrophil ', ' Blood Polymorphonuclear Neutrophil ', ' Blood Neutrophil ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Publishing ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' RNA ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' ROC Curve ', ' ROC Analyses ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Measures ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' Migraine ', ' Migraine Headache ', ' base ', ' human subject ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' peripheral blood ', ' Individual ', ' cerebral ', ' Cerebrum ', ' Whole Blood ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Hour ', ' Immune ', ' Immunes ', ' Event ', ' cohort ', ' release factor ', ' novel ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Meta-Analyses ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' Ischemic Stroke ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' dMRI ', ' Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Diffusion weighted imaging ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' DWI-MRI ', ' DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) ', ' Stroke prevention ', ' prevent stroke ', ' Coagulation Process ', ' Coagulation ', ' Clotting ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR ', ' qRTPCR ', ' Quantitative RTPCR ', ' mRNA Expression ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' Transcript ', ' Validation ', ' Derivation ', ' Derivation procedure ', ' Prevention therapy ', ' prospective ', ' discover genes ', ' gene discovery ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' global transcription profile ', ' global gene expression ', ' transcriptome ', ' emergency settings ', ' risk of stroke ', ' stroke risk ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2018,560820,CA-03,0.27762883267128713
"Stroke, Brain Networks, and Behavior ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of our research program is to develop new treatments for improving behavioral deficits post-stroke based on a formal theory of brain function and organization. However, the immediate goal of this competitive renewal is to identify patterns of disrupted structural and functional connectivity that are related to stroke-induced deficits, determine how they change during recovery, and see if they predict outcome. Computational theories have proposed that lesions to the brain will have different effects based on the underlying network architecture. Mechanisms controlling recovery of function may similarly depend on network architecture. Specific Aim 1 measures changes in whole brain functional connectivity (FC) after damage to peripheral networks that are mainly connected within the network vs. central networks that communicate more broadly with other brain networks. We measure separately the effect of cortical vs. white matter pathway damage. We predict that peripheral lesions (either to gray or white matter) will produce FC changes that are mainly limited to the affected network, while central lesions (either gray or white matter) will produce multi- network FC changes. Peripheral networks are connected to input/output pathways and mediate predominantly sensory or motor functions. Central networks are connected through association pathways and mediate predominantly attention and memory functions. Specific Aim 2 uses a machine learning ridge regression method to test the idea that sensory-motor deficits and their recovery are more dependent on structural damage and anatomical disconnection, whereas cognitive impairments are better captured by multi-network functional connectivity dysfunction. An important clinical goal of the project is to determine whether advanced neuroimaging techniques, such as structural imaging, DTI, and fMRI can provide useful clinical information on an individual patient's recovery and outcome, over and above that provided by measures of acute behavior, demographic variables, and amount of treatment. In Specific Aim 3 we enter neuroimaging data into a classifier to predict outcome in individual patients, as well as to predict the effect of rehabilitation interventions. Finally, in Specific Aim 4 we move from correlation and prediction to mechanism. Our basic hypothesis is that changes in functional connectivity after focal injury reflect alterations in brain dynamics, specifically a decrease in the variability of inter-regional phase differences. This hypothesis is tested empirically by phase measurements, but also computationally, using a biophysically based model that can simulate the FC changes observed in patients. Importantly, the model also estimates the information capacity of the damaged brain, which we will correlate with the patient's empirically measured degree of modularity and profile of behavioral deficits. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to use advanced neuroimaging techniques to understand how a stroke changes the large-scale physiology of the brain, and how those changes in turn relate to the behavioral problems caused by the stroke. We use techniques that allow us to measure how a stroke damages the connectivity of the brain, both by damaging the fiber bundles that transmit information between brain regions, but also by changing the functional communication across many brain regions. We test hypotheses concerning: 1) how damage to different parts of the brain affect these measures of connectivity; 2) how measures of connectivity can help us to predict the outcome of individual stroke patients; and, 3) whether computational modeling of connectivity can help us understand the behavioral deficits caused by a stroke.","Stroke, Brain Networks, and Behavior",9518014,R01NS095741,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Biophysics ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Communication ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Goals ', ' gray matter ', ' substantia grisea ', ' hemiparesis ', ' hemiparetic ', ' Language ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Nervous System Physiology ', ' nervous system function ', ' Neurological function ', ' Neurologic function ', ' Patients ', ' Physiology ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Research ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Visual Fields ', ' eye field ', ' Weight ', ' Measures ', ' segregation ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' Mediating ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Peripheral ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Lesion ', ' Fiber ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Measurement ', ' behavioral problem ', ' Problem behavior ', ' brain-injured ', ' brain damage ', ' Acquired brain injury ', ' Brain Injuries ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' programs ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Parietal ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Spinal ', ' Recovery of Function ', ' functional recovery ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' white matter ', ' substantia alba ', ' motor deficit ', ' Memory Loss ', ' memory decline ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Brain region ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Cognitive ', ' Behavioral ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Output ', ' poststroke ', ' post stroke ', ' neglect ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Outcome ', ' visuomotor ', ' visual motor ', ' Impairment ', ' Network-based ', ' network models ', ' impaired behavior ', ' behavioral impairment ', ' public health relevance ', ' network architecture ', ' individual patient ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' outcome prediction ', ' stroke patient ', ' ']",NINDS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,580306,MO-01,0.10410745890041652
"A Machine Learning Approach to Classifying Time Since Stroke using Medical Imaging PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Stroke is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in the United States, with approximately 795,000 Americans experiencing a new or recurrent stroke each year. Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV tPA) is the dominant and most proven treatment option, but its use is only indicated within 4.5 hours following a stroke. Unfortunately, up to 30% of stroke patients present with an unknown time since stroke (TSS) symptom onset, which makes them ineligible to receive IV tPA. Many of these individuals could be spared severe morbidity or mortality if there existed an alternative method for establishing TSS, allowing them to be identified and treated. This proposal will develop machine learning methods to create a physiologically grounded method for predicting TSS based on multiparametric magnetic resonance (MR) and computed tomography (CT) imaging data. We believe our proposed techniques will outperform state-of-the-art methods that are based on subjective image interpretation, and have the potential to provide an objective data point that may be used in conjunction with the subjective assessments of experts, or in clinical environments that lack expertise in stroke imaging Research has established that MR and CT imaging captures information that correlates with TSS. However, existing methods for extracting this information are based on a physician subjectively interpreting the images and delineating regions of interest, processes that have been documented to have only weak to moderate agreement across trained expert reviewers. An automated approach that comprehensively analyzes the spectrum of imaging data could identify complex relationships across channels that more accurately classify TSS. For example, in MR, diffusion-weighted, perfusion-weighted, and fluid attenuated inversion recovery imaging all play important roles in characterizing a stroke, but a deep understanding of how each channel may be combined to describe TSS is unknown. We propose to establish new deep learning methods for fusing this information. Specifically, we will: 1) develop a machine learning framework for classifying TSS; 2) develop a deep convolutional autoencoder to generate novel multimodal image representations from MR and CT to improve classification; and 3) implement visualization techniques that elucidate the relationship between deep features and pathophysiological stroke processes. Under this project, we will use data from the UCLA and UCI Stroke Centers, allowing us to study different patient populations and imaging techniques. The successful completion of this research will provide a new method for estimating TSS from imaging, leading to new prospective trials for providing therapy to patients with unknown TSS. PROJECT NARRATIVE Stroke is a leading cause of death in the United States, with approximately 795,000 Americans experiencing a new or recurrent stroke each year; however patients who present with an unknown stroke onset time are ineli- gible for receiving the leading therapy.

"Learning invariant representation from high- dimensional data for quantitative stroke reha    Advances in wearable electronics, personal mobile devices, and sensor technology are opening the door to many promising applications in medical care and biomedical research. However, the resulting datasets are often challenging to process due to variability caused by extraneous effects unrelated to the tasks of interest, such as changes in environmental conditions, heteroscedasticity in measurement noise, or patient idiosyncrasies. These effects produce systematic differences between the data used to train machine- learning algorithms and the data on which they are applied in practice, impairing real-world performance. The proposed research will address the fundamental problem of factoring out extraneous effects associated with known nuisance variables. We will develop a novel methodology for extracting features that ar.e invariant to nuisance variables-and hence also to the associated extraneous effects-but that are still useful for classification or regression. The methodology is based on nonparametric deep-network models that perform automatic normalization of the data, and further enforce invariance via adversarial learning. We will apply the approach to an important problem in stroke rehabilitation, the quantitated dosing of motor training. Using a dataset of sensor-based motion data, we will train the model to identify and count functional movements in stroke patients performing rehabilitation activities. We expect to show that our approach can surmount patient variability to enable rigorous movement classification and quantitation. The proposed work is significant, because it will empower investigators to undertake the dosing trials critically needed in stroke rehabilitation. The proposed work is innovative, because it departs from traditional data preprocessing techniques by combining advanced data normalization and model calibration procedures. Our work is likely to have a positive impact on stroke rehabilitation by facilitating the research required to change clinical practice and improve stroke outcomes. Our quantitative approach is broadly generalizable to applications hindered by nuisance variables, such as medical diagnostics and genomics. The proposed research is relevant to public health, because it will enable the precise measurement of rehabilitation after stroke. This will facilitate important recovery research that is expected to inform stroke rehabilitation practices and reduce the burden of stroke disability. The quantitative methodology will advance data-driven discovery in the presence of nuisance variables, which is relevant to biomedical research applications such as diagnostics, genetics, and imaging.",Learning invariant representation from high- dimensional data for quantitative stroke reha   ,9916457,R01LM013316,"['Biomedical Research ', ' Calibration ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Due Process ', ' Electronics ', ' electronic device ', ' Learning ', ' Methodology ', ' Motion ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' rehab therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' rehabilitative therapy ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Work ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' stroke rehabilitation ', ' rehabilitation after stroke ', ' stroke rehab ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Recovery ', ' Measurement ', ' Genetic ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' Performance ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Genomics ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Instruction ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' mobile device ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' network models ', ' clinical practice ', ' sensing technology ', ' sensor technology ', ' patient variation ', ' variability between patients ', ' variation between patients ', ' patient variability ', ' stroke patient ', ' stroke outcome ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' high dimensional data ', ' multidimensional data ', ' ']",NLM,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,300000,NY-12,0.2311618637860489

This legend applies to the Abstract, Specific Aims, Research Plan (al components), Commercialization Plan, and Human Subject's Sections of this proposal. Abstract The AHA Stroke Rehabilitation guideline states that in the current fiscal climate, “the provision of comprehensive rehabilitation programs with adequate resources, dose, and duration is an essential aspect of stroke care and should be a priority” [1]. While near and long-term rehabilitation goals should be guided by patient baseline motor status and potential for motor recovery [2-12], acute motor assessment and prognostication remain a clinically difficult task [13, 14]. Conventional clinical assessments (e.g. NIH Stroke Scale, Fugl-Meyer (FM) Scale) [15, 16] that power prognosis are highly dependent on the initial severity and care provider/point of care, and often reduced further to even coarser prognostic scales (e.g. Orpington Prognostic Scale (OPS)) [17]. Overall they lack the level of sophistication required to predict motor recovery and tailor rehabilitation due to ceiling effects, omission of fractionated and complex distal movements, and/or unequal weighting of the two extremities in assessments [18]. Furthermore, many survivors do not even receive comprehensive assessments prior to discharge, and telestroke approaches which are being implemented to address such issues are limited in their scope of care and still not fully developed for functional assessments [19-23]. This is critical because “all patients benefit from a formal assessment of the patient’s rehabilitation needs prior to discharge” [24]. To address these and other limitations the AHA guidelines specifically call for the development of “computer-adapted assessments for personalized and tailored interventions”, “newer technologies such as…body-worn sensors”, and “better predictor models to identify responders and nonresponders” [1]. To address these limitations, we propose to develop a system of multimodal, integrated sensors (i.e., motion capture cameras, force sensors, accelerometers, and gyroscopes) that will interface with a patient for recording their movement; a software suite with signal processing and data fusion algorithms to reduce data dimensionality and provide kinematic/kinetic based evaluations; and system software to track, classify, and predict patient disease severity. We will test this computational Integrated sensor-based Motion Analysis Suite (IMAS) in 30 stroke patients undergoing IMAS directed motor evaluations (repeated 4 times in a 2 day period) within 5 days post stroke and 6-8 weeks post stroke (after having undergone rehabilitation) focused on assessments identified as important to patient independence, activities of daily living, and ability to return to work. Quantitative kinematic/kinetic metrics descriptive of motor behavior will be derived from IMAS sensor recordings to characterize subjects’ motor performance (e.g., joint displacement, velocity, acceleration, jerk, and movement quality measures). Then, we will investigate the statistical relationships between the IMAS collected data (and with additional clinical data gathered during the patient assessments including demographics; imaging derived information; and FM, OPS, and Barthel index scores) to build statistical models to: 1. extract a low dimensional representation of disease state, 2. predict the FM scale, and 3. predict likelihood of motor recovery following treatment. Project Narrative Stroke is a major cause of death and the leading cause of disability. In the clinic, the lack of quantitative, objective methods for outcome assessment and outcome prediction considerably hamper management of the disease, ultimately leading to sub-optimal strategies for managing patient care.

"A Machine Learning Approach For CTA-based Plaque Characterization and Stroke Risk Prediction in Carotid Artery Atherosclerosis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Carotid artery atherosclerosis is a major vascular risk factor and accounts for approximately 15% of all strokes. A major risk marker in patients with carotid atherosclerosis has been the degree of narrowing, or stenosis, of the carotid artery lumen. While stenosis is often quantified via angiography, imaging can also provide detailed assessments of plaque. Our project is motivated by converging data that correlate vulnerable plaque elements, which can be captured with imaging, with increased stroke risk. Identifying high-risk or vulnerable carotid plaques before a stroke occurs is important because stroke prevention treatments, like carotid endarterectomy or stenting, carry risks and ideally should only be performed only those patients at highest risk of stroke. CTA (computed tomographic angiography) is an attractive tool for plaque imaging since it is not operator dependent, can be quickly performed, and is more widely available than MRI. Although CTA offers significant potential to evaluate these plaque features, small studies have not reached a consensus regarding their reliability and clinical relevance. In this project, we plan to explore the utility of CTA for the detailed carotid vessel wall imaging by employing a unique, large-scale clinical dataset and advanced algorithms. Our overarching objective in this R21 project is to conduct developmental and interdisciplinary research that will lay the foundation for the implementation and validation of novel CTA-based technologies that can be adopted in the risk stratification of patients with carotid atherosclerosis. Our central hypothesis is that there are CTA-based carotid plaque features that can be reliably extracted and used for stroke risk stratification, which will be more sensitive and specific than standard stenosis grading. To pursue our objective, we will pursue two specific aims: In Specific Aim 1 we plan to optimize the use of human reader defined plaque features in predicting culprit carotid plaques. We will perform a blinded, multi-reader study of CTA-derived carotid plaque features in a large scale clinical dataset to test the association between CTA-derived human-defined features and stroke, and compute accuracy metrics. In Specific Aim 2, we plan to develop algorithms to automatically characterize and discriminate culprit carotid plaque in CTA. We will implement and test image processing algorithms that automatically compute from a CTA scan stroke-associated carotid artery plaque features (from Aim 1), and then train a machine learning algorithm to distinguish culprit from asymptomatic carotid artery plaques. We believe that this R21 study is significant because it will establish a novel, machine learning-aided imaging strategy which can aid in identifying high-risk carotid artery plaques before they cause stroke and when they can be properly treated to prevent stroke from occurring in the future. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed research is relevant to public health because the discovery of novel and treatable vascular risk factors will ultimately improve risk factor screening and stroke prevention efforts, thereby reducing the incidence of a disabling and lethal disease. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of the NHLBI's mission that involves reducing the burden of vascular disease by fostering research on prevention.",A Machine Learning Approach For CTA-based Plaque Characterization and Stroke Risk Prediction in Carotid Artery Atherosclerosis,9655181,R21HL145427,"['Algorithms ', ' Angiography ', ' angiographic imaging ', ' Angiogram ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' atherosclerotic disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Carotid Arteries ', ' Carotid Artery Stenosis ', ' Carotid Artery Narrowing ', ' Carotid Stenosis ', ' computer vision ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Elements ', ' Carotid Endarterectomy ', ' vulnerable plaque ', ' atherosclerotic plaque ', ' atherosclerotic lesions ', ' atherosclerosis plaque ', ' Atheromatous plaque ', ' Atheromatous degeneration ', ' Atheromatous ', ' Atheroma ', ' Arterial Fatty Streaks ', ' Arterial Fatty Streak ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Hand ', ' blood loss ', ' Bleeding ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Incidence ', ' Ischemia ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Medicine ', ' Mission ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Modernization ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Receiver Operator Characteristics ', ' Receiver Operating Characteristics ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Stroke ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' computerized tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' catscan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' EMI scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' CT scan ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CAT scan ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' Ulceration ', ' Ulcer ', ' vasculopathy ', ' vascular dysfunction ', ' blood vessel disorder ', ' Vascular Disorder ', ' Vascular Diseases ', ' Work ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Blinded ', ' calcification ', ' Calcified ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Fostering ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' radiologist ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Consensus ', ' Adopted ', ' Scanning ', ' Techniques ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Carotid Atherosclerotic Disease ', ' Carotid Atheroscleroses ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' attenuation ', ' novel ', ' Prevention ', ' Carotid Artery Plaques ', ' carotid plaque ', ' Carotid Artery Plaque ', ' Carotid stent ', ' carotid stenting ', ' carotid artery stent ', ' Modeling ', ' Ischemic Stroke ', ' Pathological Constriction ', ' Pathologic Constriction ', ' Stenosis ', ' Institution ', ' prevent stroke ', ' Stroke prevention ', ' Data ', ' Imaging Device ', ' Imaging Tool ', ' Imaging Instrument ', ' Reader ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Risk Marker ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cerebrovascular ', ' cerebro-vascular ', ' cerebral vascular ', ' systematic review ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' NHLBI ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' high risk ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' screening ', ' vascular risk factor ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' patient stratification ', ' stratified patient ', ' Risk stratification ', ' stroke risk ', ' risk of stroke ', ' risk for stroke ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' ConvNet ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' ']",NHLBI,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R21,2019,121619,NY-12,0.2439623571940843
"Motor cortex network dynamics driving stroke recovery PROJECT SUMMARY Ischemic stroke is the most common cause of disability in US, with motor impairment being the most common form of disability. Rehabilitation therapies remain a mainstay treatment during recovery, but are not very effective for those with moderate to severe upper extremity weakness. Physical and pharmacologic interventions could become more effective if recovery mechanisms were better understood. The studies proposed here will use cutting-edge techniques to dissect the mechanisms of post-stroke recovery at the level of cortical neuronal networks. The principal investigator (PI) is a board-certified neurologist, and has extensive training in neuroscience, stroke neurobiology, and clinical management of patients with neurological diseases. The long- term goal is to understand relationships between the cortical neural network and the motor behaviors with a focus on motor recovery. The proposed research and career development plans will provide the necessary training, mentorship and experience to launch the PI’s career as a successful, R01-funded clinician-scientist. The PI has recently developed deep learning (a branch of machine learning) tools for automated and unbiased analysis of animal behavioral imaging data. Preliminary data demonstrate that, by using these automated tools, 3D kinematics of paw movements can be obtained during a food pellet reaching task in a head-fixed mouse, distinct neural activity patterns emerge in the primary motor cortex (M1) during motor learning of the skilled reaching, and stroke induces changes in the kinematics of the reaching behavior. In the proposed studies, the following specific hypotheses will be tested: stable neuronal network activity patterns emerge in M1 during motor learning (Aim-1); these M1 activity patterns destabilize after a stroke and sensorimotor disconnection (Aim-2); and new M1 activity patterns emerge after post-stroke task-specific rehabilitation (Aim-3). The PI will use, and be further trained on state-of-the-art techniques to record neural population activity (two-photon calcium imaging), to label and silence projection neurons (retro-AAVs and designer-receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs), and to analyze the kinematics of the behavior (deep learning tools). For this purpose, he has assembled a strong mentorship team with experts in their respective fields: Primary mentor Dr. Peyman Golshani (two-photon calcium imaging and analysis in behaving animals), as well as co-mentors, Dr. S. Thomas Carmichael (stroke recovery research), Dr. Jonathan Kao (neural dynamics analysis in motor cortex), and clinically, Dr. Bruce Dobkin (translational neurorehabilitation). The mentored research will be complemented with course work on state-space methods, biostatistics, bioethics, deep learning, responsible conduct of research, and grant writing; as well as improvement of professional skills by publishing manuscripts, presenting at meetings, and participating in workshops on leadership and management. By the end of K08 award, it is expected that the PI will obtain R01 funding as a clinician-scientist and independent investigator, focused on understanding mechanisms of the neural networks that can be modulated to improve motor behavior after stroke. PROJECT NARRATIVE Understanding the mechanisms of motor recovery will ultimately lead to better therapies for stroke recovery. In the proposed research, we aim to elucidate the motor recovery process by investigating the precise activity patterns of brain cells during skilled reaching movements that will be kinematically analyzed by novel automated tools. These brain-behavior correlations will generate fundamental knowledge about stroke recovery to inform new interventions that can reduce the burden of disability caused by stroke.",Motor cortex network dynamics driving stroke recovery,9762241,K08NS109315,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Animals ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Bioethics ', ' Biomedical Ethics ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Calcium ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Control Groups ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Forelimb ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Head ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Leadership ', ' Learning ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Motor Cortex ', ' body movement ', ' Movement ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Population Dynamics ', ' Publishing ', ' rehabilitative therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Research ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' research and development ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' somesthetic sensory cortex ', ' Somatosensory Cortex ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Stroke ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Injury ', ' career ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Image Analysis ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' stroke rehabilitation ', ' stroke rehab ', ' rehabilitation after stroke ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Neurologist ', ' Recovery ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Development Plans ', ' Funding ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Investigation ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' 3D ', ' 3-D ', ' joint mobilization ', ' joint movement ', ' joint mobility ', ' meetings ', ' brain cell ', ' experience ', ' sensory cortex ', ' neuron loss ', ' neuronal loss ', ' neuronal death ', ' neuronal cell loss ', ' neuronal cell death ', ' neuron death ', ' neuron cell loss ', ' neuron cell death ', ' nerve cell loss ', ' nerve cell death ', ' Recovery of Function ', ' functional recovery ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' neuronal circuitry ', ' neuronal circuit ', ' kinematics ', ' kinematic model ', ' Manuscripts ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' neural circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' career development ', ' stroke therapy ', ' treating stroke ', ' stroke treatment ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Ischemic Stroke ', ' Upper Extremity ', ' Upper Limb ', ' Membrum superius ', ' Brain region ', ' imaging method ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Rehabilitation Research ', ' Clinical Management ', ' Functional Imaging ', ' physiological imaging ', ' Physiologic Imaging ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' post stroke ', ' poststroke ', ' after stroke ', ' two-photon ', ' 2-photon ', ' stroke recovery ', ' network dysfunction ', ' Population ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' Coupled ', ' Impairment ', ' brain behavior ', ' Neurorehabilitation ', ' Neuro rehabilitation ', ' motor learning ', ' locomotor learning ', ' disability burden ', ' motor impairment ', ' movement limitation ', ' movement impairment ', ' functional restoration ', ' restore lost function ', ' restore functionality ', ' restore function ', ' responsible research conduct ', ' motor recovery ', ' designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs ', ' DREADDs ', ' imaging study ', ' recruit ', ' deep learning ', ' neural network ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' ConvNet ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K08,2019,213840,CA-33,0.148595574740937
"A Machine Learning Approach to Classifying Time Since Stroke using Medical Imaging PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Stroke is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in the United States, with approximately 795,000 Americans experiencing a new or recurrent stroke each year. Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV tPA) is the dominant and most proven treatment option, but its use is only indicated within 4.5 hours following a stroke. Unfortunately, up to 30% of stroke patients present with an unknown time since stroke (TSS) symptom onset, which makes them ineligible to receive IV tPA. Many of these individuals could be spared severe morbidity or mortality if there existed an alternative method for establishing TSS, allowing them to be identified and treated. This proposal will develop machine learning methods to create a physiologically grounded method for predicting TSS based on multiparametric magnetic resonance (MR) and computed tomography (CT) imaging data. We believe our proposed techniques will outperform state-of-the-art methods that are based on subjective image interpretation, and have the potential to provide an objective data point that may be used in conjunction with the subjective assessments of experts, or in clinical environments that lack expertise in stroke imaging Research has established that MR and CT imaging captures information that correlates with TSS. However, existing methods for extracting this information are based on a physician subjectively interpreting the images and delineating regions of interest, processes that have been documented to have only weak to moderate agreement across trained expert reviewers. An automated approach that comprehensively analyzes the spectrum of imaging data could identify complex relationships across channels that more accurately classify TSS. For example, in MR, diffusion-weighted, perfusion-weighted, and fluid attenuated inversion recovery imaging all play important roles in characterizing a stroke, but a deep understanding of how each channel may be combined to describe TSS is unknown. We propose to establish new deep learning methods for fusing this information. Specifically, we will: 1) develop a machine learning framework for classifying TSS; 2) develop a deep convolutional autoencoder to generate novel multimodal image representations from MR and CT to improve classification; and 3) implement visualization techniques that elucidate the relationship between deep features and pathophysiological stroke processes. Under this project, we will use data from the UCLA and UCI Stroke Centers, allowing us to study different patient populations and imaging techniques. The successful completion of this research will provide a new method for estimating TSS from imaging, leading to new prospective trials for providing therapy to patients with unknown TSS. PROJECT NARRATIVE Stroke is a leading cause of death in the United States, with approximately 795,000 Americans experiencing a new or recurrent stroke each year; however patients who present with an unknown stroke onset time are ineli- gible for receiving the leading therapy.

"Quantitative Rehabilitation after Stroke PROJECT SUMMARY Stroke causes significant disability, and recovery is often incomplete. In animal models of stroke, robust upper extremity (UE) motor recovery can be elicited if high doses of functional training are given early. In humans, however, the optimal training dose is unknown, because no quantitative dose-response trials have been undertaken in the first months after stroke. This deficiency stems from a lack of measurement instruments that can accurately and easily quantify UE functional training dose and recovery. To address this gap, this proposal will generate two new measurement tools to enable quantitative stroke recovery research. The first tool (Aim 1) will quantify the number of functional movements made during stroke rehabilitation, measuring UE training dose. The second tool (Aim 2) will quantify the abnormality of movements, measuring UE recovery and response to interventions. We will combine wireless motion capture and computational methodologies to create objective, precise, and user-friendly tools. Inertial measurement units, worn by individuals with stroke and healthy controls performing various activities, will capture upper body motion. In Aim 1, machine learning algorithms will be trained to identify and count functional movements in activities normally practiced during rehabilitation. In Aim 2, functional principal components analysis will quantify movement impairment and compensation in standardized motions. Validity will be determined by correlating tool outcomes with current gold standards. The proposed study will be conducted at New York University, in collaboration with investigators from the NYU Center for Data Science, Columbia University, and Washington University-St. Louis. Each have complementary expertise in machine learning, functional data analysis, and functional movement identification. This K02 Independent Scientist Award will provide the candidate with skill in advanced motion capture and analytical methodologies needed to study stroke rehabilitation and recovery. The career development plan includes personalized tutorials and coursework combined with longitudinal oversight of data analysis, providing an excellent foundation for launching an independent research career. Ultimately, the developed tools have the potential to immediately impact neurorehabilitation research, facilitating the rigorous dose-response trials so critically needed to change clinical practice and improve stroke outcomes.

"Whole Genome RNA Sequencing (RNAseq) of Blood from Patients with Lacunar Stroke Abstract  Lacunar strokes are small infarctions of deep penetrator end arteries that supply deep areas of brain including the basal ganglia, internal capsule, thalamus and pons. The “cause” of lacunar strokes has been controversial. C Miller Fisher was the first to suggest that hypertension was one cause, noting lipohyalinosis (inflammation, fibrinoid necrosis of vessel wall) in smaller penetrating arteries (<200um) occurred only in hypertensives. He also showed, however, that larger lacunar strokes were often associated with microatheroma associated narrowing of larger penetrating arteries. This pathology is now thought to be the most common and associated with lipid abnormalities and diabetes. Moreover, some lacunar strokes are now thought to be associated with intracranial atherosclerosis of the parent artery at the origin of the penetrators. Though lacunar strokes were not traditionally associated with large vessel extracranial atherosclerosis or cardioembolism, there are now a number of cases where lacunar strokes have been associated with large vessel atherosclerosis or cardiac causes. Indeed, in our own recent study we showed that as many as ~50% of small deep infarcts (>15mm in size) were predicted to be due to large vessel atherosclerosis or to cardioembolic disease. It is crucial to identify the correct causes of lacunar strokes because treatments differ: drugs for hypertension vs drugs for lipid abnormalities, surgery for large vessel carotid disease, anticoagulants for cardioembolic disease, and anti-platelet agents for lacunar strokes associated with hypertension or abnormal lipids or diabetes. The biology of lacunar strokes has been studied very little, and there are no accepted biomarkers for lacunar stroke or its causes. Our group, however, has begun to provide novel insights into how the immune and clotting profiles in peripheral blood differ in lacunar strokes compared to large vessel and cardioembolic strokes. We have shown that the immune response in large vessel and cardioembolic cortical strokes is mainly associated with neutrophil genes, whereas the immune response in lacunar stroke associated with hypertension /lipids/ diabetes is associated with inflammatory monocyte-related genes. However, since the preliminary studies were performed on whole blood, there is a great need to study individual immune cell types in these different causes of ischemic stroke. Therefore, in this study we will isolate neutrophils and monocytes in patients with lacunar stroke compared to large vessel and cardioembolic stroke. We will perform RNA sequencing on those cells in the following aims which allows us to measure expression levels of >250,000 alternatively spliced transcripts which are derived from the ~20,000 coding genes.  Specific Aim #1. Use RNAseq to demonstrate that alternatively spliced transcript level expression profiles in monocytes, neutrophils and whole blood differ for subcortical lacunar strokes associated with hypertension, abnormal lipids, diabetes, large vessel atherosclerosis, or cardioembolism compared to each other and compared to matched controls.  Specific Aim #2. Use RNAseq to demonstrate that alternatively spliced transcript level expression profiles for subcortical lacunar strokes with hypertension, lipids or diabetes are associated with monocytes, and differ from cortical large vessel and cardioembolic strokes which are associated mainly with neutrophils.  Specific Aim #3a. Use Support Vector Machine (SVM) to derive the minimum number of transcripts from Aim #1 that differentiate the different causes of lacunar strokes including hypertension, abnormal lipids, diabetes, large vessel atherosclerosis, or cardiac disease. Specific Aim #3b. Use the profiles derived in Aim #3a to predict the cause of lacunar stroke in a second cohort using qRT-PCR to measure expression and SVM to perform predictions with >85% sensitivity and specificity.  Significance: Identifying the causes of lacunar strokes based upon splice variant expression in individual blood cell types is important since it would affect therapy used for secondary stroke prevention. Narrative  This study will perform whole genome RNAsequencing of whole blood, neutrophils and monocytes from patients with lacunar strokes and correlate gene profiles with each cause of lacunar stroke. It will then show the lacunar stroke profiles differ from cortical strokes due to cardioembolism and large vessel atherosclerosis, and the profiles can be used to predict the cause of lacunar stroke in an independent validation cohort of patients which is important because different causes of lacunar strokes require different treatments.",Whole Genome RNA Sequencing (RNAseq) of Blood from

"Smartwatch Monitoring for Atrial Fibrillation After Stroke Project Summary / Abstract Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the world’s most common serious heart rhythm problem and causes 15% of all strokes, a major cause of disability and death among Americans. Long-term monitoring for early AF detection and treatment is recommended for many stroke patients, but although existing cardiac monitors are accurate, they suffer from methodologic and cost limitations that preclude their long-term use. In the proposed, “Smartwatch Monitoring for Atrial Fibrillation Real-Time in Stroke,” Study, our overall objective is to enhance paroxysmal AF (pAF) detection by enhancing and testing Pulsewatch, an innovative, smartwatch-based technology for long-term rhythm monitoring of stroke patients. For Aim 1, we embed our state-of-the art AF detection algorithms, interactive messaging to promote adherence, and novel contact and motion noise correction capabilities into a smartwatch to enable near-continuous pulse waveform analysis. We will further refine Pulsewatch through focus groups and a Hack-a-thon with stroke patients and their medical providers. For Aim 2, we will enroll 90 stroke survivors and provide them with a smartphone and smartwatch, both encoded with Pulsewatch. We will compare the performance of Pulsewatch when worn daily for 7 days to conventional 7-day cardiac monitoring for pAF detection. For Aim 3, we will determine the acceptability and usability of Pulsewatch through follow-up interviews and focus groups in 30 randomly selected participants from Aim 2 asked to continue wearing smartwatch daily for an additional 30 days. We will identify patient factors associated with adherence and evaluate the impact of Pulsewatch use on disease-specific quality of life, anxiety, and self- activation among the 30 users compared to 30 stroke patients treated with usual care through baseline and 1- month assessments. Our research will lead to the development of a highly acceptable, enabling cardiovascular monitoring technology designed by, and for, stroke patients that facilitates long-term non-invasive screening for pAF, as well as communication between stroke patients and their medical providers.

"Detecting bleeding events using EHRs for prediction in Afib Abstract Atrial fibrillation (AF) affects millions of mostly older Americans. Atrial fibrillation contributes to stroke and weighing stroke risk against risk of bleeding from oral anticoagulants (AC) is central to AF management. AC decision-making has become more complex in recent years with the introduction of several target specific oral AC agents. It remains challenging to advise older AF patients about AC since they are frequently at high risk for stroke and complications from AC, particularly bleeding, and data are limited on real-world outcomes of AC among vulnerable populations. Our project, Detecting bleeding Events using Electronic records for Prediction in Atrial Fibrillation (DEEP AF), will leverage novel biomedical natural language processing (NLP) approaches to integrate bleeding-related information from both the structured and unstructured EHR records and statistical and deep learning approaches to predict risk of bleeding on AF patients on AC therapy. DEEP AF will address present knowledge gaps to accurately identify bleeding events from longitudinal electronic health records and to improve bleeding prediction accuracy and focus on modifiable, clinically relevant risk factors, thereby facilitating future large-scale comparative effectiveness studies evaluating AC agents, and helping clinicians develop better approaches to weighing AC risks and benefits.

"Whole Transcriptome Studies of Patients with Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transient ischemic attacks (TIA) are critical to identify because prevention therapy can reduce the risk of future vascular events by > 50%. Diagnostic testing and therapeutic intervention must start as soon as possible because 10-25% of TIAs have a stroke within 90 days. Because so many patients present emergently with transient neurological events the large majority of whom do not go on to have a stroke, methods for identifying TIAs at high risk for stroke have been sought so that work up and treatment can be targeted to those who need it most to save time, money and limited resources. Though the ABCD2 score and brain Diffusion Weighted Imaging-MRI (DWI-MRI) have improved prediction of which TIAs have a stroke, their sensitivity and specificity for prediction of individual cases i poor. In this proposal we propose that peripheral blood leukocytes and platelets play pivotal roles in which TIAs go on to have a stroke and by assessing RNA in whole blood we can evaluate leukocyte and platelet function in TIA patients who go on to have stroke versus those that do not have a stroke. We hypothesize that specific coagulation and immune genes are activated in TIA patients that predispose them to have a stroke by 90 days compared to those TIA patients who do NOT have a stroke by 90 days. A subset of these leukocyte and platelet mRNA genes will predict TIAs who have a stroke by 90 days. This hypothesis is addressed by the following specific aims. Aim #1 (Derivation Cohort): Demonstrate that mRNA expression measured using RNAseq from whole blood differs in a derivation cohort of TIAs that go on to have a stroke by 90 days compared to those TIAs who do not have a stroke by 90 days. Demonstrate that most mRNA found to be regulated using RNAseq are also significantly regulated when measured using qRT-PCR. Aim #2 (Derivation Cohort): Apply machine learning algorithms to the mRNA from Aim #1 to derive an optimal subset of mRNA regulated by both RNAseq and qRT-PCR that predict which TIAs have strokes by 90 days compared to those who do not with >95% sensitivity on cross-validation. Aim #3 (Validation Cohort): Use machine/prediction learning algorithms to demonstrate that the genes from Aim #2 when measured using qRT-PCR on an independent validation cohort predict which TIAs have a stroke by 90 days with >85% sensitivity. The goal of these studies is to discover mRNA profiles in blood that predict which TIA patients go on to have strokes by 90 days. When confirmed in future studies, this will direct in depth testing to those high risk TIAs most in need in order to prevent strokes, and decrease unnecessary testing in those with low risk of stroke. Equally as important, the genes discovered to be associated with high risk of stroke in TIA patients will represent potential novel stroke prevention targets. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will examine RNA in blood using RNAseq and qRT-PCR of human subjects with Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs) who have a stroke by 90 days compared to TIAs who do not have a stroke.

"Noninvasive Real-time Estimation of Cerebral Blood Flow for Personalized Stroke Assessment PROJECT SUMMARY Stroke is the second leading cause of death and the third leading cause of disability worldwide. Similar trends exist in the U.S., where it is estimated that every 40 seconds a stroke occurs, leading to a stroke-related death every 4 minutes. Afflicting approximately 800,000 Americans each year, time sensitive and widely practicable diagnostic algorithms are paramount. Despite increasing emphasis on the significance of blood flow characteristics in pursuing strokes, estimating regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) inside the skull is no trivial task. Imaging techniques that provide rCBF distribution may be unavailable due to time constraint or access to facilities, or simply the expenses attached to it. In our preliminary studies, we have developed a model that can give blood flow estimates in real-time for the entire brain vasculature. Here, we propose a novel hybrid computational model that utilizes high-performance computing and machine learning to simulate the entire brain vasculature, as well as provide real time measures of regional CBF. We will use novel mathematical methods to determine the vascular geometry of each subject using our existing imaging database that includes CTA and CBF images from stroke patients, and will subsequently validate our simulations against the same dataset. Finally, we will use machine learning algorithms to extract patterns in stroke patients' blood flow and give estimates for stroke severity predictors on patient- specific measurements. PROJECT NARRATIVE The objective of this project is to estimate blood flow properties in the brain and its correlation with stroke. We will simulate and validate a model to give similar information as the expensive perfusion scanning measurements.

"Sleep apnea after stroke: Implications for screening and treatment ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abstract Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability and a leading cause of death in the US, and results in $21 billion in direct medical costs each year. Stroke disproportionately impacts minorities including Hispanics who have higher stroke risk, poorer outcomes after stroke, and a higher prevalence of post-stroke sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). Declining stroke mortality in combination with the aging US population will result in dramatic increases in the number of disabled stroke survivors, with the largest increases projected among Hispanics. New approaches to improve stroke outcomes are therefore urgently needed, and may be particularly important among Hispanics, the largest US minority population. One critical yet scarcely explored opportunity may exist through identification and treatment of SDB in individuals with stroke. SDB is highly prevalent after stroke, and its presence predicts poor functional outcome and higher mortality. Nonetheless, very few stroke patients are screened or treated for SDB. Little information is available about which patients are likely to have high risk SDB after stroke; the trajectory of SDB in this setting and how to predict it; and almost no data are available for Hispanics. This information may offer opportunities to improve critical post-stroke outcomes and lessen ethnic stroke disparities. Thus, the main goals of the research proposed are 1) develop risk stratification models for post-stroke patients with SDB, 2) provide novel insight into the trajectory that SDB takes after stroke to inform management decisions, 3) inform the design of a subsequent clinical trial that will assess the impact of treatment of high risk SDB on key post-stroke outcomes, and 4) explore a possible treatable cause for worse stroke outcomes in Hispanics. We plan to take advantage of an exceptional opportunity provided by the ongoing Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC) project (R01 NS38916). In this population-based stroke surveillance study in a bi-ethnic community, all acute ischemic stroke patients are interviewed at baseline and followed prospectively for 3, 6 and 12 month outcomes. The current application will add longitudinal SDB assessments to BASIC using a validated portable SDB screening device. SDB severity will be assessed with the apnea/hypopnea index, as well as innovative measures derived from signal analysis. Use of BASIC provides a cost-effective opportunity to expand our knowledge about SDB after stroke in ways that can directly impact clinical care, future clinical trial design, and health disparities.

"Antiplatelet in Stroke:  Safety and Effectiveness in Seniors (ASSESS) The current U.S. and European guidelines recommend antiplatelet therapy such as aspirin, clopidogrel, or dual antiplatelet therapy to reduce the risk of recurrent ischemic events in patients with noncardioembolic ischemic stroke. However, selection of antiplatelet agents can be a difficult decision to make for older patients. Not only older individuals are at increased risk for recurrent strokes, they also face risk for bleeding complications. While it is known that drug selection should be individualized, it remains unknown how to tailor antiplatelet therapy according to patient unique characteristics, preferences, needs, and values. The long-term goal is to use com- parative effectiveness research to improve primary and secondary prevention in cardiovascular disease and stroke. Leveraging the American Heart Association (AHA) Get With The Guidelines Stroke (GWTG) registry and Medicare claims, the overall objective in this application is to develop patient-centered evidence-based strategies to improve antiplatelet treatment selection for older individuals presenting with noncardioembolic ischemic stroke. The central hypothesis is that individuals differ in many characteristics, such as age, sex, presence of comorbid- ities, or concurrent medications, which can influence the potential benefits and harms associated with the treat- ment. Once the variability in response to treatment is known, selection of an antiplatelet agent can be made based on patient risk profiles, preferences, and known efficacy/safety of the agents, making treatment both safer and more effective. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) determine the long-term clinical effectiveness of different antiplatelet regimens in patients with noncar- dioembolic ischemic stroke; 2) determine the long-term safety of different antiplatelet regimens; and 3) balance benefits and harms of each antiplatelet regimen while incorporating patient preferences into decision-making. The proposed research is innovative in four key ways: 1) a patient-centered approach is used to address a real- life decisional dilemma facing stroke survivors and clinicians; 2) it shifts focus from selected samples in clinical trials to nationwide representative stroke population, including traditionally underrepresented subgroups in com- munity practice; 3) novel propensity score inverse probability weighting method using generalized boosted mod- els (a machine learning technique) will be employed to mimic a trial-type multi-treatment design, uncover treat- ment heterogeneity, and minimize selection bias in observational data; 4) beyond traditional mechanisms of scientific publications, the evidence generated from this study will be disseminated to stroke survivors, clinicians, and relevant stakeholders through the AHA GWTG-led national quality initiatives and patient-led efforts to insure a rapid translation of seminal findings into clinical practice. The proposed research is significant, because it is expected to help guide personalized antiplatelet therapy in older ischemic stroke survivors that could best meet their needs and lead to better outcomes most meaningful to patients. Ultimately, such knowledge has the poten- tial to inform evidence-based treatment decisions in stroke that now afflicts more than 7.2 million Americans. The proposed research will develop patient-centered evidence-based strategies to improve antiplatelet treatment selection for older individuals presenting with noncardioembolic ischemic stroke. It is relevant to public health because the development and adoption of personalized evidence-based antiplatelet therapy is expected to re- duce recurrent ischemic events, minimize treatment complications, and improve outcomes most meaningful to patients. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH’s mission that pertains to developing funda- mental knowledge that will help to enhance health and reduce the burdens of illness and disability.",Antiplatelet in Stroke:  Safety and Effectiveness in Seniors (ASSESS),9713571,R01AG062770,"['Adoption ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' American Heart Association ', ' Aspirin ', ' Acetylsalicylic Acid ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Complication ', ' Decision Making ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heart ', ' blood loss ', ' Bleeding ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' Ischemia ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' Probability ', ' Public Health ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Selection Bias ', ' Societies ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Stroke ', ' Testing ', ' Translations ', ' United States ', ' United States Health Care Financing Administration ', ' Health Care Financing Administration ', ' Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' Weight ', ' Woman ', ' clopidogrel ', ' Antiplatelet Agents ', ' Antiplatelet Drugs ', ' therapy selection ', ' Selection for Treatments ', ' Treatment Failure ', ' therapy failure ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Link ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' disability ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' European ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Level of Evidence ', ' Event ', ' Techniques ', ' preference ', ' American ', ' cardiovascular disorder prevention ', ' cardiovascular disease prevention ', ' cardiac disease prevention ', ' CVD prevention ', ' novel ', ' Secondary Prevention ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Ischemic Stroke ', ' prevent stroke ', ' Stroke prevention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Coagulation ', ' Clotting ', ' Coagulation Process ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Community Practice ', ' Observational Study ', ' Observational research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observation research ', ' Seminal ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Evidence based treatment ', ' burden of illness ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' effectiveness research ', ' older patient ', ' elderly patient ', ' Clinical effectiveness ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Individual Differences ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' treatment effect ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' comparative effectiveness ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' evidence base ', ' Medicare claim ', ' treatment response ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' clinical practice ', ' Regimen ', ' individualized medicine ', ' unique treatment ', ' tailored treatment ', ' tailored therapy ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' individualized treatment ', ' individualized therapy ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' customized treatment ', ' customized therapy ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' Patient risk ', ' individual patient ', ' improved outcome ', ' stroke survivor ', ' stroke patient ', ' ']",NIA,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,510532,NC-04,0.23777388348288947
"Enhancing Stroke Prehospital and Emergency Evaluation and Delivery (E-SPEED) Nearly 800,000 people in the United States (US) each year are affected by stroke, which remains the leading cause of adult disability and 5th leading cause of death. Despite the proliferation of stroke centers nationwide, access to timely stroke care and evidence-based therapies is still poor with multiple inefficiencies, redundancies, errors, and system-based barriers that lead to care fragmentation. A stroke system of care that integrates and coordinates care between non-stroke center hospitals, primary stroke centers, and comprehensive stroke centers has been recommended since it would reduce stroke-related deaths by 20,000 annually in the US and nearly 400,000 worldwide. This proposal is significant because it addresses two important gaps in knowledge about the acute evaluation and treatment of stroke patients: prehospital screening errors and delays in inter-hospital transfer. The Enhancing Stroke Prehospital and Emergency Evaluation and Delivery (E-SPEED) study will (1) enhance existing LVO screening tools, assess whether machine learning approaches improve LVO prediction, and evaluate the impact of an Enhanced LVO Screening Tool in the prehospital setting; and (2) use learning collaboratives and simulations to design, implement, and pilot test a new inter-hospital stroke transfer protocol. We bring together systems engineers and stroke health service researchers in a novel collaboration that will produce generalizable knowledge that can be widely applied to other urban regions of the country and provide preliminary data and demonstration of novel approaches that could be evaluated in large-scale comparative effectiveness studies across multiple regions. NARRATIVE Timely acute stroke treatments can be life-saving and reduce disability from stroke; however, a minority of patients receive these treatments in a timely manner or at all.

"Fast and Easy Assessment of Stroke PROJECT SUMMARY The goal of this study is to develop an objective tool for the fast and easy assessment of stroke, by developing a novel analytics platform that quickly identifies potential stroke from movement signatures captured with wearable sensors. The tool uses unobtrusive wearable sensors and does not require medical training to operate, and thus will be valuable for families and caregivers of older Americans with high stroke risk who are either living at home or in an assisted living facility. Ischemic stroke affects nearly 700,000 Americans each year, costs approximately $33 billion annually, and is the fifth leading cause of death and a leading cause of disability in the US. IV tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) has been an FDA approved therapy for ischemic stroke since 1995, yet only 5-10% of eligible patients receive this therapy. Arrival time in the emergency room (ER) after initial stroke symptoms is directly associated with better outcomes after tPA and endovascular therapy, specifically 4.5 hours and up to 24 hours in select patients, respectively. It is well established that treatment with tPA decreases the lifetime cost of stroke to third party payers by $25,000 per patient. As a result, health plans will be the ultimate economic buyer for this new technology. Here, we are not developing a new therapy for stroke, where so many others have failed. We seek, rather, to fill a well-accepted and clear gap for stroke patients: the early recognition of stroke symptoms that prevents them from accessing PROVEN but time dependent treatments in stroke, whose impact on outcomes is well established. Early identification of symptoms and timely treatment is the single most important determinant of outcomes in ischemic stroke. However, despite massive public health campaigns, most people do not identify stroke symptoms, resulting in costly delays in calling 9-1-1 and patients arriving in the hospital too late to benefit from ischemic stroke treatments. This is a growing problem, given the aging US population of which a significant portion lives at home alone, the staffing crisis at assisted living and nursing facilities, and the prevalence of stroke which is expected to increase by 20% by 2030. Given these trends, administrators and aging experts are increasingly recognizing the value of remote monitoring and aging in place initiatives. Thus, there a clear and urgent, unmet need for a method to assist untrained stroke victims, their families and caregivers in the early recognition of stroke. Bridging this gap with a fast, easy and objective solution would have significant public health impact, because millions of patients could access therapies in a window that is already known to improve outcomes for brain injury. To address this problem, we have leveraged our team’s unique expertise in stroke neurology and developed a set of activation tasks coupled with a wearable solution to assess and quantify ischemic stroke. Once deployed, our solution will improve stroke emergency response and increase the number of patients receiving IV tPA and other reperfusion therapies in the acute setting. NARRATIVE Ischemic stroke affects nearly 700,000 Americans, costs approximately $33 billion annually, and is the fifth leading cause of death and a leading cause of disability in the US. Though treatment for stroke has been available for over 20 years, only a very small number of eligible patients receive it because individuals who have suffered a stroke do not reach the emergency room in time. We have developed a method for quick, easy, real-time assessment for stroke, which will dramatically improve the number of patients receiving timely therapy after stroke and improve the outcome for stroke.",Fast and Easy Assessment of Stroke,9847511,R43NS110338,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Computers ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Economics ', ' Non-Trunk ', ' Limbs ', ' Extremities ', ' Limb structure ', ' Family ', ' Feedback ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' care facilities ', ' Healthcare Facility ', ' Health Facilities ', ' Health care facility ', ' hemiparetic ', ' hemiparesis ', ' Hospitals ', ' Interview ', ' longterm care ', ' extended care ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' Medical Directors ', ' Physician Executives ', ' Methods ', ' Minor ', ' body movement ', ' Movement ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' nurse ', ' Nurses ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Patients ', ' t-PA ', ' Tissue-Type Plasminogen Activator ', ' Tissue Plasminogen Activator ', ' Tissue Activator D-44 ', ' T-Plasminogen Activator ', ' Recombinant Tissue Plasminogen Activator ', ' Alteplase ', ' Public Health ', ' Quantitative Evaluations ', ' rehabilitative therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' reperfusion ', ' Reperfusion Therapy ', ' Science ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Stroke ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Administrator ', ' Family Care Giver ', ' Family Caregiver ', ' Third-Party Payer ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Health Campaign ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Neurologist ', ' Measurement ', ' Brain Injuries ', ' brain-injured ', ' brain damage ', ' Acquired brain injury ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' American ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' acute stroke ', ' acute cerebrovascular accident ', ' Early identification ', ' Modeling ', ' stroke therapy ', ' treating stroke ', ' stroke treatment ', ' Assisted Living Facilities ', ' assistive living facilities ', ' assistive living ', ' assisted living ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Manufacturer Name ', ' Manufacturer ', ' Ischemic Stroke ', ' Oranges ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' research clinical testing ', ' clinical test ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Validation ', ' Wireless Technology ', ' wireless ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' post stroke ', ' poststroke ', ' after stroke ', ' life time cost ', ' lifetime cost ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new drugs ', ' new drug treatments ', ' volunteer ', ' healthy volunteer ', ' motor impairment ', ' movement limitation ', ' movement impairment ', ' FDA approved ', ' standard of care ', ' clinical practice ', ' phase 1 study ', ' Phase I Study ', ' Emergency Department Physician ', ' Emergency room physician ', ' Emergency Physician ', ' ER physician ', ' ED Physician ', ' Emergency response ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' Innovation Corps ', ' I-Corps ', ' Accelerometer ', ' activity tracker ', ' activity monitor ', ' accelerometry ', ' individual patient ', ' improved outcome ', ' stroke survivor ', ' stroke symptom ', ' wearable device ', ' wearable sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' body sensor ', ' health plan ', ' health plans ', ' societal costs ', ' stroke patient ', ' stroke victims ', ' stroke risk ', ' risk of stroke ', ' risk for stroke ', ' stroke outcome ', ' aging in place ', ' age in place ', ' stroke neurology ', ' ']",NINDS,"ALVA HEALTH, INC.",R43,2019,256988,CT-03,0.2902532353918618
"Data-driven subtyping to find patients with drug interactions leading to stroke Project Summary Stroke is a highly heterogeneous and complex disease and is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Identification of the cause of disease is essential for risk stratification and optimal treatment, but can be difficult, as up to 35% of causes are undetermined by traditional subtyping criteria and very few causative genetic variants have been found. In addition, certain causes may be hidden within the clinical picture of a patient, such as an adverse drug reaction. Using data-driven approaches to analyze the medical records of patients may uncover novel patterns of risk factors and clinical features leading to stroke. The long-term goal of this research is to identify novel subtypes of highly heterogeneous diseases such as stroke and to reduce the genetic heterogeneity of a disease cohort by identifying patients with the same subtype. The objective of this application is to propose a pipeline that applies a data-driven analysis of medical notes to identify novel subtypes of stroke, focus on a subtype caused by an adverse drug reaction or drug pair interaction, validate the subtype in a genotyped study cohort, and look for gene variant enrichment in this cohort. This application’s central hypothesis is that applying deep learning to the electronic health record (EHR) of acute ischemic stroke patients will form subtypes based on more granular information than currently implemented and with reduced genetic heterogeneity by identifying novel patterns of risk factors and clinical picture leading to the stroke. In addition, we hypothesize that at least one subtype will identify patients whose stroke is an adverse drug reaction or drug-drug interaction. To do this, Aim 1 will first identify all acute ischemic stroke patients in the EHR by developing a machine learning classifier trained on structured data in the EHR. Aim 2 will then build and train an unsupervised deep learning algorithm on text from medical notes to identify clusters, or subtypes, of patients with similar clinical pictures. Aim 3 will finally validate reduction in genetic heterogeneity of these cohorts by estimating observational heritability of all subtypes using a tool created in our lab and comparing this with the heritability estimates of subtypes derived from physician-based criteria. It will also focus on a not well-studied subtype, stroke due to an adverse drug reaction or drug-drug interaction, by identifying its enrichment in the novel subtypes, validating this subtype in a study cohort with genotyped data, and finally looking for enrichment of pharmacogenetic variants in this subtype. These aims will generate a computational pipeline that identifies novel subtypes of acute ischemic stroke, enabling improved future genetic studies by reducing genetic heterogeneity of cohorts and improved understanding of the underlying causes of the disease. Project Narrative Stroke is a highly complex disease that is a leading cause of death and severe disability. Identifying the cause of stroke is essential for risk stratification and optimal treatment, but up to a third of cases are of undetermined cause, and very few genetic variants have been identified due to the heterogeneity of the disease. To address this, this research proposal develops a computational pipeline that applies data-driven deep learning to medical notes to identify novel combinations of environmental, genetic, and medical risk factors causing the disease; this tool may clarify the etiology of unknown stroke cases, provide cohorts of patients enriched with similar genetic variants, and be expanded to subtype any disease.",Data-driven subtyping to find patients with drug interactions leading to stroke,9772123,F30HL140946,"['Algorithms ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cause of Death ', ' intracranial vascular dysfunction ', ' cerebrovascular dysfunction ', ' cerebral vascular dysfunction ', ' cerebral vascular disease ', ' brain vascular dysfunction ', ' brain vascular disease ', ' Intracranial Vascular Disorders ', ' Intracranial Vascular Diseases ', ' Cerebrovascular Disease ', ' Brain Vascular Disorders ', ' Cerebrovascular Disorders ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Electrocardiography ', ' EKG ', ' ECG ', ' Electrocardiogram ', ' Future ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' blood loss ', ' Bleeding ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Manuals ', ' Medical Records ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' nervous system function ', ' Neurological function ', ' Neurologic function ', ' Nervous System Physiology ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacogenetics ', ' Physicians ', ' Probability ', ' Radiology ', ' General Radiology ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' Research ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Semantics ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Stroke ', ' Technology ', ' United States ', ' falls ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Blood flow ', ' Genetic Heterogeneity ', ' Internet ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Categories ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Drug Interactions ', ' Reporting ', ' acute stroke ', ' acute cerebrovascular accident ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' genetic risk factor ', ' inherited factor ', ' Modeling ', ' case control ', ' Ischemic Stroke ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' genetic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' stroke recovery ', ' Heritability ', ' patient population ', ' population based ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' Genetic study ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' disease heterogeneity ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subtypes ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subgroups ', ' Risk stratification ', ' optimal treatments ', ' optimal therapies ', ' stroke patient ', ' deep learning ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' random forest ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' automated analysis ', ' adverse drug reaction ', ' learning algorithm ', ' ']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,F30,2019,50016,NY-13,0.2067276826053077
"Shaping Neural Population Dynamics to Facilitate Learning Project Summary Behavior and cognition emerge from the coordinated activity of populations of interacting neurons. To change behavior we must change the architecture of the network that drives behavior. What are the rules whereby the activity of populations of neurons can change during learning? If we could observe the neural population dynamics that underlie skill learning, we might be able to facilitate learning. This ability may eventually lead to improvements to neurally- based rehabilitation strategies that can facilitate the recovery from stroke.  We will use a neurofeedback paradigm to shape the neural population dynamics that underlie skill learning. To do this, we will record the activity of dozens of neurons in the motor cortex of Rhesus monkey subjects. Animals will control a cursor on a computer screen by generating neural command signals. This is neurofeedback because the animal directly observes a projection of his neural activity, in the form of the movement of the onscreen cursor. This paradigm allows us to study learning simply by perturbing the mapping from neural activity to cursor movement on the screen. Following such a perturbation the animal must discover how to generate new patterns of neural activity that are now appropriate to restore good control of the onscreen cursor.  We will ask two linked questions. First, how does the animal learn to generate new patterns of neural activity? And second, can we facilitate that process? Neurofeedback-based learning offers complementary advantages to arm movements for studying the neural population dynamics that accompany learning. Chieﬂy, only in a neurofeedback paradigm can we be certain that the learning-induced changes in neural activity we observe matter directly for behavior, because only the neurons we record directly impact behavior in this paradigm.  We will test classic theories of skill learning, converted into speciﬁc hypotheses about how neural activity patterns will change throughout the multi-day course of skill learning.  If our neurofeedback-based incremental training schemes do facilitate learning, then this research will inform the work of rehabilitation specialists who work with stroke patients. We (and others) believe that if neurofeedback-based therapies are coupled with standard behavioral therapies for stroke, rehabilitation outcomes will improve. Project Narrative Stroke can be a debilitating condition. Only ﬁfty percent of stroke survivors make a full recovery, and that is usually only after extensive rehabilitation. The recovery from stroke and skill learning are probably closely related. We propose to develop brain-computer interface neurofeedback paradigms to facilitate the learning of new skills.

"Big Data Neuroimaging to Predict Motor Behavior After Stroke PROJECT SUMMARY  Stroke is a leading cause of serious long-term adult disability around the world. Despite intensive therapy, an estimated 2/3 of stroke survivors do not fully recover and are left unable to care for themselves independently. Growing research suggests that rehabilitation is not “one-size-fits-all”; variability among stroke survivors in terms of lesion location, age, gender, time since stroke and more may all affect a person's likelihood of recovery and response to different types of treatments. Personalized rehabilitation medicine to maximize each individual's recovery potential is thus desperately needed. However, in order to develop accurate, robust, and specific predictive models that can determine an individual's recovery potential and response to different treatments, large, heterogeneous datasets are needed. The current best predictors of stroke outcomes are neuroimaging (MRI) and behavioral biomarkers that look at brain structure/function and motor performance at baseline. Generating a large enough dataset of MRI and behavioral data is extremely difficult and expensive for any one site to do on its own. This proposal addresses this problem by generating a large, diverse dataset using a novel meta-analytic approach that harmonizes post-stroke data collected worldwide. In partnership with an international consortium comprised of over 500 researchers who produce the largest-known neuroimaging and genetic studies of over 18 different diseases (ENIGMA Center for Worldwide Medicine, Imaging, and Genomics), I propose to apply ENIGMA's powerful approach to answer critical questions in stroke recovery. Under this K01 career development award, I will develop skills in big data neuroimaging analytics, clinical research, and consortium building through my ENIGMA Stroke Recovery working group in order to ask questions about stroke recovery using a large dataset approach (goal n>3,000). This project has four specific aims: Aim 1 will leverage ENIGMA's existing methodology to develop the infrastructure, optimal methods, and analysis techniques for harmonizing a large dataset of post-stroke MRI and behavioral data. Aim 2 will use this large dataset to identify neural and behavioral biomarkers predicting recovery of motor impairment (e.g., actual arm movement ability) and recovery of function (e.g., ability to perform tasks, such as picking up objects with the affected arm). Aim 3 will use supervised machine learning to generate and fine-tune highly accurate predictive models of the relationship between these biomarkers and recovery of impairment versus function. Lastly, Aim 4 will use unsupervised machine learning techniques to examine shared properties of outliers from the predictive model and determine additional neurobiological mechanisms that may prevent individuals from recovering. This approach has the potential to revolutionize the way that rehabilitation research is validated, to ensure robust, reliable, and reproducible results. The methods developed here could be extended to other domains of recovery (language, gait), to study other predictors of recovery (functional brain activity, genomics), and to other clinical populations to improve rehabilitation overall. PROJECT NARRATIVE The overall goal of this project is to provide personalized, precise rehabilitation medicine to individuals after stroke by developing accurate predictive models that help us detect who will recover and best respond to different types of post-stroke treatments. Using a novel meta-analytic approach, this project will harmonize datasets of brain imaging and behavioral information across sites worldwide in order to develop a large dataset with thousands of participants. Advanced statistical and machine learning techniques will then be applied to this dataset in order to detect robust neural and behavioral biomarkers that can be used to predict stroke recovery and to personalize treatments across diverse populations.",Big Data Neuroimaging to Predict Motor Behavior After Stroke,9663209,K01HD091283,"['Activities of Daily Living ', ' functional capacity ', '

"Toward a Mechanistic Understanding of Optimization Principles Underlying Hemiparetic Gait This project seeks to identify how motor impairments in stroke survivors contribute to mobility deficits through the use of behavioral observations and computational models. Ultimately, this knowledge could be used to design more effective interventions to improve walking ability, increase functional independence, and reduce fall risk in individuals post-stroke. After a stroke, walking ability is affected by motor control deficits which are often characterized by hemiparesis, or weakness on one side of the body. During walking, hemiparesis is often associated with a visible limp that is due to differences in step lengths and stance times between the right and left sides of the body. Reducing these right-left asymmetries are a common objective of rehabilitation, and recently researchers have developed a number of approaches designed to reduce asymmetries such as acoustic pacing, unilateral step training, and split-belt treadmill training. Despite the recent clinical focus on reducing asymmetry, the potential functional benefits of improving symmetry have yet to be established. This research will address this gap by answering two fundamental questions: 1) Do improvements in symmetry lead to functional benefits such as a more efficient walking pattern or improvements in balance? 2) If stroke survivors retain the capacity to walk more symmetrically why do they choose to do otherwise? Although improvements in symmetry can no doubt reduce the potential stigma of walking with a limp, it is possible that a symmetric walking pattern could be less efficient or put patients at a higher risk of falls if it requires that they push the limits of their capacity. Alternatively, it is possible that, through repeated stepping practice, post- stroke individuals have reinforced a suboptimal pattern due to insufficient experience with a more optimal, symmetric pattern. Addressing these issues requires a thorough understanding of the processes by which stroke survivors optimize their walking pattern. Here, these issues are addressed using behavioral approaches to quantify tradeoffs between asymmetry and measures of walking ability such as stability and economy, and computational methods to identify the causal relationships linking these variables. Ultimately, the knowledge derived from this work will provide a mechanistic understanding of how the damaged brain optimizes movement, and may also inform the way in which clinicians develop personalized rehabilitation objectives for stroke survivors. Our findings may also inform cost/benefit analyses of walking in other patient populations known to have asymmetric walking patterns such as amputees or individuals with Parkinson's disease. Furthermore, providing a more mechanistic rationale for gait rehabilitation interventions could improve the efficiency of physical therapy, reduce health care costs, and ultimately help to better reintegrate individuals with neuromotor impairments into society by maximizing their mobility. Public Health Relevance Statement This project seeks to identify the how walking impairments in stroke survivors contribute to mobility deficits through the use of behavioral observations and computational models. The chosen approach integrates biomechanical analyses, physiological assessments and machine learning algorithms to explain how asymmetries during walking influence balance and the effort required to walk. Ultimately, the results of this work may lead to more personalized rehabilitation strategies to improve walking capacity and efficiency, and ultimately reduce fall risk in stroke survivors.",Toward a Mechanistic Understanding of Optimization Principles Underlying Hemiparetic Gait,9753311,R01HD091184,"['Acceleration ', ' Acoustics ', ' Acoustic ', ' Affect ', ' Amputees ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Biomechanics ', ' biomechanical ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' cost benefit effectiveness ', ' cost benefit economics ', ' Cost-Benefit Analysis ', ' Environment ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' foot ', ' Gait ', ' Gases ', ' Goals ', ' hemiparetic ', ' hemiparesis ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' body movement ', ' Movement ', ' Neurologic Organ System ', ' Neurologic Body System ', ' Nervous System ', ' Nervous system structure ', ' paretic muscle ', ' paretic ', ' Muscular Paresis ', ' Muscle Paresis ', ' Paresis ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Parkinsons disease ', "" Parkinson's disease "", "" Parkinson's "", ' Parkinson ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Patients ', ' rehabilitative therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Societies ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Stroke ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Walking ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' improved ', ' stroke rehabilitation ', ' stroke rehab ', ' rehabilitation after stroke ', ' Left ', ' Clinical ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Brain Injuries ', ' brain-injured ', ' brain damage ', ' Acquired brain injury ', ' Functional disorder ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Metabolic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Mechanics ', ' mechanical ', ' Side ', ' Reaction ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' behavior observation ', ' behavioral observation ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' visual feedback ', ' computer science ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Speed ', ' Participant ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Physical therapy ', ' Physiotherapy ', ' Physical Therapeutics ', ' Physical Medicine Procedure ', ' Physiatric Procedure ', ' fall risk ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Exercise Physiology ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' post stroke ', ' poststroke ', ' after stroke ', ' cost ', ' injured ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' Step training ', ' Step retraining ', ' Individual Differences ', ' Impairment ', ' rehabilitation strategy ', ' rehab strategy ', ' motor impairment ', ' movement limitation ', ' movement impairment ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' motor control ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' patient population ', ' clinical practice ', ' treadmill training ', ' locomotor control ', ' gait rehabilitation ', ' gait training ', ' treadmill ', ' walking speed ', ' walking pace ', ' stroke survivor ', ' functional independence ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2019,381129,CA-37,0.1854457409517399
"Hemostasis, Hematoma Expansion, and Outcomes After Intracerebral Hemorrhage PROJECT SUMMARY Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is the most morbid form of stroke and has no treatment approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Hematoma expansion (HE), interval growth of the hematoma, is a proximate cause of worse patient outcomes and death as larger hematomas displace brain tissue; hematomas > 60 mL reliably lead to disability or death at follow-up. Preventing HE is a promising strategy to improve outcomes for patients with ICH. Our relative inability to predict HE, however, has impeded the development of effective treatment strategies for ICH, and several clinical trials have been unsuccessful. Even when HE has been reduced, our ability to detect a benefit is hampered by relatively insensitive patient outcomes. This proposal will resolve two roadblocks that prevent the development of effective treatments for ICH, the most morbid form of stroke. Three comprehensive stroke centers (two from the Northwestern Medicine system in metropolitan Chicago, IL, and the University of Texas at Houston) will partner to prospectively enroll patients with ICH, measure hemostasis, measure HE, and record patient outcomes with state of the art assessments, including the NIH Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) and NIH Toolbox. First, we will determine the mechanisms that lead to HE in acute ICH, broadly grouped into platelet activity, activation of coagulation, and fibrinolysis. Each can be specifically measured and has specific treatments to improve it. For example, reduced platelet activity due to aspirin can be reliably improved with desmopressin, delayed activation of coagulation may be related to hypomagnesemia, and accelerated fibrinolysis may be reduced with tranexamic acid or aminocaproic acid. Each will be examined for predicting HE; if multiple pathways are found, we will determine which are most important with machine learning. Once the most important mechanisms of hemostasis for HE are determined, we will explore if specific therapies improve platelet activity. It is possible that specific treatments for specific deficits in hemostasis will be more likely to reduce HE than single therapies applied to ICH patients generally (e.g., Factor VII). Once hemostatic mechanisms of HE are determine, we will determine the effect of HE on patient outcomes such as the modified Rankin Scale (mRS, a global ordinal scale), PROMIS, and NIH Toolbox. This will be crucial to plan for future clinical trials intended to improve patient outcomes through correcting abnormal hemostasis in acute ICH. Results will apply broadly to other bleeding conditions (e.g., neurotrauma). PROJECT NARRATIVE Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is the most morbid form of stroke. Hematoma expansion is a proximate cause of worse outcome after ICH, yet our ability to predict HE is limited. This proposal will determine how platelet activity, activation of coagulation, and fibrinolysis predict HE, and how HE, in turn, affect patient outcomes.","Hemostasis, Hematoma Expansion, and Outcomes After Intracerebral Hemorrhage",9714475,R01NS110779,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aminocaproic Acids ', ' Antifibrinolytic Agents ', ' Antifibrinolytics ', ' Antifibrinolysins ', ' Aspirin ', ' Acetylsalicylic Acid ', ' Blood Platelets ', ' Thrombocytes ', ' Platelets ', ' Marrow platelet ', ' Intracerebral Hemorrhage ', ' Cerebrum Hemorrhage ', ' Cerebral Parenchymal Hemorrhage ', ' Cerebral Hemorrhage ', ' Cerebral Brain Hemorrhage ', ' Cerebral hemisphere hemorrhage ', ' Chicago ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Deamino Arginine Vasopressin ', ' 1-Desamino-8-arginine Vasopressin ', ' Desmopressin ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' cothromboplastin ', ' autoprothrombin I ', ' Stable Factor ', ' Serum Prothrombin Conversion Accelerator ', ' Proconvertin ', ' Factor VII ', ' Eptacog Alfa ', ' Coagulation Factor VII ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor VII ', ' Coagulation Factor VIIa ', ' Activated Factor VII ', ' Activated Blood Coagulation Factor VII ', ' Factor VIIa ', ' Fibrinolyses ', ' Fibrinolysis ', ' Future ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Hematoma ', ' blood loss ', ' Bleeding ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Hemostasis ', ' Hemostatic function ', ' Hemostatics ', ' Hemostatic Agents ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' Information Systems ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Medicine ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Patient Reported Outcomes ', ' Patient Outcomes Assessments ', ' Patients ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Risk ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Stroke ', ' Texas ', ' Thromboelastography ', ' Thrombelastography ', ' computerized tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' catscan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' EMI scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' CT scan ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CAT scan ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' t-AMCHA ', ' AMCHA ', ' AMCA ', ' Tranexamic Acid ', ' USFDA ', ' Food and Drug Administration ', ' United States Food and Drug Administration ', ' Universities ', ' vasculopathy ', ' vascular dysfunction ', ' blood vessel disorder ', ' Vascular Disorder ', ' Vascular Diseases ', ' clopidogrel ', ' Measures ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Plts ', ' Blood Platelet Transfusion ', ' Platelet Transfusion ', ' Hypomagnesemia ', ' myocardium ischemia ', ' myocardial ischemia/hypoxia ', ' heart ischemia ', ' coronary ischemia ', ' cardiac ischemia ', ' Ischemic myocardium ', ' Ischemic Heart Disease ', ' Ischemic Heart ', ' Myocardial Ischemia ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Survivors ', ' disability ', ' Intuition ', ' Measurement ', ' Brain Injuries ', ' brain-injured ', ' brain damage ', ' Acquired brain injury ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Dependence ', ' Scanning ', ' System ', ' brain tissue ', ' American ', ' metropolitan ', ' Reporting ', ' Nervous System Trauma ', ' neurotrauma ', ' Neurological trauma ', ' Neurological Injury ', ' Neurological Damage ', ' Nervous System damage ', ' Nervous System Injuries ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Coagulation ', ' Clotting ', ' Coagulation Process ', ' Data ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' point of care ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' health related quality of life ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' treatment strategy ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' improved outcome ', ' stroke trials ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' ']",NINDS,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2019,632829,IL-07,0.10473027517140233
"Learning invariant representation from high- dimensional data for quantitative stroke reha    Advances in wearable electronics, personal mobile devices, and sensor technology are opening the door to many promising applications in medical care and biomedical research. However, the resulting datasets are often challenging to process due to variability caused by extraneous effects unrelated to the tasks of interest, such as changes in environmental conditions, heteroscedasticity in measurement noise, or patient idiosyncrasies. These effects produce systematic differences between the data used to train machine- learning algorithms and the data on which they are applied in practice, impairing real-world performance. The proposed research will address the fundamental problem of factoring out extraneous effects associated with known nuisance variables. We will develop a novel methodology for extracting features that ar.e invariant to nuisance variables-and hence also to the associated extraneous effects-but that are still useful for classification or regression. The methodology is based on nonparametric deep-network models that perform automatic normalization of the data, and further enforce invariance via adversarial learning. We will apply the approach to an important problem in stroke rehabilitation, the quantitated dosing of motor training. Using a dataset of sensor-based motion data, we will train the model to identify and count functional movements in stroke patients performing rehabilitation activities. We expect to show that our approach can surmount patient variability to enable rigorous movement classification and quantitation. The proposed work is significant, because it will empower investigators to undertake the dosing trials critically needed in stroke rehabilitation. The proposed work is innovative, because it departs from traditional data preprocessing techniques by combining advanced data normalization and model calibration procedures. Our work is likely to have a positive impact on stroke rehabilitation by facilitating the research required to change clinical practice and improve stroke outcomes. Our quantitative approach is broadly generalizable to applications hindered by nuisance variables, such as medical diagnostics and genomics. The proposed research is relevant to public health, because it will enable the precise measurement of rehabilitation after stroke. This will facilitate important recovery research that is expected to inform stroke rehabilitation practices and reduce the burden of stroke disability. The quantitative methodology will advance data-driven discovery in the presence of nuisance variables, which is relevant to biomedical research applications such as diagnostics, genetics, and imaging.",Learning invariant representation from high- dimensional data for quantitative stroke reha   ,9978948,R01LM013316,"['Biomedical Research ', ' Calibration ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Due Process ', ' Learning ', ' Methodology ', ' Motion ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' rehab therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' rehabilitative therapy ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Work ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' rehabilitation after stroke ', ' stroke rehab ', ' stroke rehabilitation ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Recovery ', ' Measurement ', ' Genetic ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' Performance ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Genomics ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' mobile device ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' network models ', ' clinical practice ', ' sensing technology ', ' sensor technology ', ' wearable electronics ', ' wearable technology ', ' wearable device ', ' patient variation ', ' variability between patients ', ' variation between patients ', ' patient variability ', ' stroke patient ', ' stroke outcome ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' high dimensional data ', ' multidimensional datasets ', ' multidimensional data ', ' ']",NLM,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,300000,NY-12,0.2311618637860489
"Achieving Optimal Motor Function in Stroke Survivors via a Human-Centered Approach to Design an mHealth Platform Project Summary / Abstract  Upper-limb paresis is the most common impairment following a stroke affecting 75% of stroke survivors, which can be more prominent in one of the two limbs. Most recovery of functional impairments occurs within the first few weeks after stroke and plateaus thereafter. Unfortunately, even after patients reach a stable phase of recovery, their functional level of the stroke-affected limb may decline. Therefore, it is clinically important to maintain the regained functional level beyond the first couple weeks of spontaneous recovery by continuing to practice the use of the affected limb during daily living.  Wearable technologies have emerged as a low-cost, objective tool to monitor the performance of the upper limbs during activities of daily living (ADLs). However, to date, there exists no study that has investigated the effectiveness of a mobile-health (mHealth) system aiming to enable high-dosage motor performance in chronic stroke survivors in the real-world setting. Specifically, the optimal configuration of the goal setting, feedback mechanism and ways to share data among the stakeholders (patients and clinicians) remains unknown.  This proposal aims to develop and validate an mHealth technology that aims to encourage affected limb use during the performance of ADLs in chronic stroke survivors. To accomplish this goal, we will employ the unique finger-worn ring sensor (accelerometer), developed by our academic-industry partnership, that can capture both gross-arm and fine-hand use of the limbs that are essential in the performance of ADLs. We will study important aspects of making positive behavior changes to encourage the affected limb use by fully leveraging the computational insights drawn from sensor data combined with clinical insights from providers.  To accomplish this research goal, Aim 1 will focus on the development of an mHealth platform, composed of body-networked sensors and cloud-based systems, to monitor the real-world use of the limbs in chronic stroke survivors. In Aim 2, we will develop machine-learning based algorithms to extract clinically meaningful information regarding real-world upper limb use from sensor data. Aim 3 will investigate the optimal design of our mHealth system – such as individual tailoring of the goal, design of the feedback, medium and timing to deliver feedback, and ways to share data among the stakeholders (patients and clinicians) – via human-centered design approaches. Finally, in Aim 4, we will validate the short-term (8 weeks) effectiveness of the mHealth system in improving the use of the affected limb through a field deployment study.  We believe that outcomes of this project will open a new door leading to previously unexplored datasets and understanding of patient-technology interactions to promote positive behavior changes to enable a high dosage of physical and occupational therapy, which can form the basis of a wide range of future investigations of hemiparesis rehabilitation and personalized disease management. Project Narrative  Upper-limb paresis is the most common impairment following a stroke affecting 75% of stroke survivors, which can be more prominent in one of the two limbs. It is clinically important that stroke survivors continue to practice the use of the stroke-affected limb in their home and community settings to maintain the functional level learned in the clinic, but currently, there exists no effective, practical clinical tool. In this project, we propose to develop and validate an mHealth technology that will monitor real-world upper limb activity by leveraging our novel finger-worn accelerometer sensors and provide individually-tailored feedback to encourage affected limb use.",Achieving Optimal Motor Function in Stroke Survivors via a Human-Centered Approach to Design an mHealth Platform,9887267,R01EB027777,"['Activities of Daily Living ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' daily living functionality ', ' functional ability ', ' functional capacity ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Behavior ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Environment ', ' Evaluation Studies ', ' Limb structure ', ' Extremities ', ' Limbs ', ' Non-Trunk ', ' Feedback ', ' Fingers ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Hand ', ' hemiparesis ', ' hemiparetic ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Motor Skills ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Occupational Therapy ', ' Patients ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' rehab therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' rehabilitative therapy ', ' Research ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Technology ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' dosage ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' disability ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Withdrawal ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Investigation ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' behavior change ', ' Using hands ', ' Hand functions ', ' Performance ', ' functional recovery ', ' Recovery of Function ', ' novel ', ' UE paresis ', ' Upper Extremity Pareses ', ' paretic upper extremity ', ' paretic upper limb ', ' upper limb paresis ', ' Brachial Paresis ', ' Health Care Technology ', ' Healthcare Technology ', ' Health Technology ', ' Functional impairment ', ' functional disability ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Physiatric Procedure ', ' Physical Medicine Procedure ', ' Physical Therapeutics ', ' Physiotherapy ', ' Physical therapy ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Provider ', ' Membrum superius ', ' Upper Limb ', ' Upper Extremity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' after stroke ', ' poststroke ', ' post stroke ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Upper limb movement ', ' Impairment ', ' Network-based ', ' chronic stroke ', ' upper limb hemiparesis ', ' usability ', ' community setting ', ' industrial partnership ', ' industry partnership ', ' industry partner ', ' data sharing ', ' Secure ', ' arm ', ' m-Health ', ' mobile health ', ' mHealth ', ' cloud based ', ' data visualization ', ' motor recovery ', ' arm movement ', ' accelerometry ', ' activity monitor ', ' activity tracker ', ' Accelerometer ', ' individualized management ', ' individualized patient management ', ' personalized clinical management ', ' personalized disease management ', ' precision management ', ' personalized management ', ' stroke survivor ', ' cloud server ', ' cloud platform ', ' recruit ', ' body sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' wearable sensor ', ' wearable system ', ' wireless sensor technology ', ' wearable sensor technology ', ' wearable electronics ', ' wearable technology ', ' wearable device ', ' primary care provider ', ' care providers ', ' internet platform ', ' web platform ', ' ']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST,R01,2020,537650,MA-02,0.17466110520001807
"Balancing Risks and Benefits of Direct Oral Anticoagulants in Older Ischemic Stroke Patients with Atrial Fibrillation The 2019 U.S. practice guidelines recommend direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) such as dabigatran, rivarox- aban, and apixaban over warfarin for stroke prevention in high-risk patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). However, the selection of a DOAC can be challenging for older ischemic stroke patients. The risk-benefit ratios in second- ary stroke prevention differ substantially from those in primary prevention. Not only are older stroke survivors at increased risk for recurrent ischemic events, older age and history of ischemic stroke are also major risk factors for bleeding complications. While it is known that drug selection should be individualized, it remains unknown how to tailor anticoagulant therapy according to the effectiveness/safety of the agents and patient unique char- acteristics. The long-term goal is to use comparative effectiveness research to improve quality of care and out- comes in patients with cardiovascular disease and stroke. Leveraging the American Heart Association (AHA) Get With The Guidelines-Stroke Registry (GWTG-Stroke) and Medicare inpatient and Part D database, the over- all objective of this application is to develop evidence-based strategies to improve appropriate anticoagulant therapy for secondary prevention in older ischemic stroke patients with AF. The central hypothesis is that differ- ences exist between DOACs in terms of effectiveness and safety, which have direct implications for therapeutic selection. Once the relative effectiveness/safety is known, the selection of an anticoagulant can be made based on patient risk profiles, making treatment safer and more effective. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hy- pothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Determine the long-term clinical effectiveness and safety of different DOACs for secondary prevention in older ischemic stroke patients with AF; 2) Investigate DOACs dosing patterns and evaluate the potential impact of underdosing or overdosing on long-term outcomes. The proposed research is innovative in four key ways: 1) A patient-centered approach is used to address a real-life decisional dilemma facing stroke survivors and clinicians; 2) It shifts focus from selected samples in clinical trials to a nationwide representative stroke population, including traditionally underrepresented subgroups in commu- nity practice; 3) A novel propensity score inverse probability weighting method using generalized boosted models (a machine learning technique) will be employed to mimic a trial-type multi-treatment design, uncover treatment heterogeneity, and minimize selection bias in observational data; 4) Beyond traditional mechanisms of scientific publications, the evidence generated from this study will be disseminated to stroke survivors, clinicians, and relevant stakeholders through the AHA GWTG-led national quality initiatives and patient-led efforts to ensure a rapid translation of seminal findings into clinical practice. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to help guide personalized anticoagulant therapy in older ischemic stroke survivors that could best meet their needs and lead to better outcomes most meaningful to patients. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential to inform evidence-based treatment decisions in stroke that now afflicts more than 7.2 million Americans. The proposed research will develop patient-centered evidence-based anticoagulant therapy for secondary pre- vention in older ischemic stroke patients with atrial fibrillation. It is relevant to public health because the devel- opment and adoption of personalized evidence-based anticoagulant therapy are expected to reduce recurrent ischemic events, minimize treatment complications, and improve outcomes most meaningful to patients. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH’s mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge that will help to enhance health and reduce the burdens of illness and disability.",Balancing Risks and Benefits of Direct Oral Anticoagulants in Older Ischemic Stroke Patients with Atrial Fibrillation,10051556,R01AG066672,"['Adoption ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', '

"Hemostasis, Hematoma Expansion, and Outcomes After Intracerebral Hemorrhage PROJECT SUMMARY Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is the most morbid form of stroke and has no treatment approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Hematoma expansion (HE), interval growth of the hematoma, is a proximate cause of worse patient outcomes and death as larger hematomas displace brain tissue; hematomas > 60 mL reliably lead to disability or death at follow-up. Preventing HE is a promising strategy to improve outcomes for patients with ICH. Our relative inability to predict HE, however, has impeded the development of effective treatment strategies for ICH, and several clinical trials have been unsuccessful. Even when HE has been reduced, our ability to detect a benefit is hampered by relatively insensitive patient outcomes. This proposal will resolve two roadblocks that prevent the development of effective treatments for ICH, the most morbid form of stroke. Three comprehensive stroke centers (two from the Northwestern Medicine system in metropolitan Chicago, IL, and the University of Texas at Houston) will partner to prospectively enroll patients with ICH, measure hemostasis, measure HE, and record patient outcomes with state of the art assessments, including the NIH Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) and NIH Toolbox. First, we will determine the mechanisms that lead to HE in acute ICH, broadly grouped into platelet activity, activation of coagulation, and fibrinolysis. Each can be specifically measured and has specific treatments to improve it. For example, reduced platelet activity due to aspirin can be reliably improved with desmopressin, delayed activation of coagulation may be related to hypomagnesemia, and accelerated fibrinolysis may be reduced with tranexamic acid or aminocaproic acid. Each will be examined for predicting HE; if multiple pathways are found, we will determine which are most important with machine learning. Once the most important mechanisms of hemostasis for HE are determined, we will explore if specific therapies improve platelet activity. It is possible that specific treatments for specific deficits in hemostasis will be more likely to reduce HE than single therapies applied to ICH patients generally (e.g., Factor VII). Once hemostatic mechanisms of HE are determine, we will determine the effect of HE on patient outcomes such as the modified Rankin Scale (mRS, a global ordinal scale), PROMIS, and NIH Toolbox. This will be crucial to plan for future clinical trials intended to improve patient outcomes through correcting abnormal hemostasis in acute ICH. Results will apply broadly to other bleeding conditions (e.g., neurotrauma). PROJECT NARRATIVE Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is the most morbid form of stroke. Hematoma expansion is a proximate cause of worse outcome after ICH, yet our ability to predict HE is limited. This proposal will determine how platelet activity, activation of coagulation, and fibrinolysis predict HE, and how HE, in turn, affect patient outcomes.","Hemostasis, Hematoma Expansion, and Outcomes After Intracerebral Hemorrhage",9902563,R01NS110779,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aminocaproic Acids ', ' Antifibrinolytic Agents ', ' Antifibrinolysins ', ' Antifibrinolytics ', ' Aspirin ', ' Acetylsalicylic Acid ', ' Blood Platelets ', ' Marrow platelet ', ' Platelets ', ' Thrombocytes ', ' Cerebral hemisphere hemorrhage ', ' Cerebral Brain Hemorrhage ', ' Cerebral Hemorrhage ', ' Cerebral Parenchymal Hemorrhage ', ' Cerebrum Hemorrhage ', ' Intracerebral Hemorrhage ', ' Chicago ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Desmopressin ', ' 1-Desamino-8-arginine Vasopressin ', ' Deamino Arginine Vasopressin ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor VII ', ' Coagulation Factor VII ', ' Eptacog Alfa ', ' Factor VII ', ' Proconvertin ', ' Serum Prothrombin Conversion Accelerator ', ' Stable Factor ', ' autoprothrombin I ', ' cothromboplastin ', ' Factor VIIa ', ' Activated Blood Coagulation Factor VII ', ' Activated Factor VII ', ' Coagulation Factor VIIa ', ' Fibrinolysis ', ' Fibrinolyses ', ' Future ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Hematoma ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Bleeding ', ' blood loss ', ' Hemostatic function ', ' Hemostasis ', ' Hemostatic Agents ', ' Hemostatics ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Information Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Medicine ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Patient Outcomes Assessments ', ' Patient Reported Measures ', ' Patient Reported Outcomes ', ' Patients ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Risk ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Texas ', ' Thrombelastography ', ' Thromboelastography ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' CAT scan ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CT Xray ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' Xray CAT scan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' Xray computerized tomography ', ' catscan ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' computer tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computerized tomography ', ' Tranexamic Acid ', ' AMCA ', ' AMCHA ', ' t-AMCHA ', ' United States Food and Drug Administration ', ' Food and Drug Administration ', ' USFDA ', ' Universities ', ' Vascular Diseases ', ' Vascular Disorder ', ' blood vessel disorder ', ' vascular dysfunction ', ' vasculopathy ', ' clopidogrel ', ' Measures ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Blood Platelet Transfusion ', ' Plts ', ' Platelet Transfusion ', ' Hypomagnesemia ', ' Ischemic Heart ', ' Ischemic Heart Disease ', ' Ischemic myocardium ', ' cardiac ischemia ', ' coronary ischemia ', ' heart ischemia ', ' myocardial ischemia/hypoxia ', ' myocardium ischemia ', ' Myocardial Ischemia ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Survivors ', ' disability ', ' Intuition ', ' Measurement ', ' Acquired brain injury ', ' brain damage ', ' brain-injured ', ' Brain Injuries ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Dependence ', ' Scanning ', ' System ', ' brain tissue ', ' American ', ' metropolitan ', ' Reporting ', ' Nervous System Injuries ', ' Nervous System damage ', ' Neurological Damage ', ' Neurological Injury ', ' Neurological trauma ', ' neurotrauma ', ' Nervous System Trauma ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Clotting ', ' Coagulation ', ' Coagulation Process ', ' Data ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' point of care ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' health related quality of life ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' treatment strategy ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' improved outcome ', ' stroke trials ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' ']",NINDS,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2020,613310,IL-07,0.10473027517140233
"Motor cortex network dynamics driving stroke recovery PROJECT SUMMARY Ischemic stroke is the most common cause of disability in US, with motor impairment being the most common form of disability. Rehabilitation therapies remain a mainstay treatment during recovery, but are not very effective for those with moderate to severe upper extremity weakness. Physical and pharmacologic interventions could become more effective if recovery mechanisms were better understood. The studies proposed here will use cutting-edge techniques to dissect the mechanisms of post-stroke recovery at the level of cortical neuronal networks. The principal investigator (PI) is a board-certified neurologist, and has extensive training in neuroscience, stroke neurobiology, and clinical management of patients with neurological diseases. The long- term goal is to understand relationships between the cortical neural network and the motor behaviors with a focus on motor recovery. The proposed research and career development plans will provide the necessary training, mentorship and experience to launch the PI’s career as a successful, R01-funded clinician-scientist. The PI has recently developed deep learning (a branch of machine learning) tools for automated and unbiased analysis of animal behavioral imaging data. Preliminary data demonstrate that, by using these automated tools, 3D kinematics of paw movements can be obtained during a food pellet reaching task in a head-fixed mouse, distinct neural activity patterns emerge in the primary motor cortex (M1) during motor learning of the skilled reaching, and stroke induces changes in the kinematics of the reaching behavior. In the proposed studies, the following specific hypotheses will be tested: stable neuronal network activity patterns emerge in M1 during motor learning (Aim-1); these M1 activity patterns destabilize after a stroke and sensorimotor disconnection (Aim-2); and new M1 activity patterns emerge after post-stroke task-specific rehabilitation (Aim-3). The PI will use, and be further trained on state-of-the-art techniques to record neural population activity (two-photon calcium imaging), to label and silence projection neurons (retro-AAVs and designer-receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs), and to analyze the kinematics of the behavior (deep learning tools). For this purpose, he has assembled a strong mentorship team with experts in their respective fields: Primary mentor Dr. Peyman Golshani (two-photon calcium imaging and analysis in behaving animals), as well as co-mentors, Dr. S. Thomas Carmichael (stroke recovery research), Dr. Jonathan Kao (neural dynamics analysis in motor cortex), and clinically, Dr. Bruce Dobkin (translational neurorehabilitation). The mentored research will be complemented with course work on state-space methods, biostatistics, bioethics, deep learning, responsible conduct of research, and grant writing; as well as improvement of professional skills by publishing manuscripts, presenting at meetings, and participating in workshops on leadership and management. By the end of K08 award, it is expected that the PI will obtain R01 funding as a clinician-scientist and independent investigator, focused on understanding mechanisms of the neural networks that can be modulated to improve motor behavior after stroke. PROJECT NARRATIVE Understanding the mechanisms of motor recovery will ultimately lead to better therapies for stroke recovery. In the proposed research, we aim to elucidate the motor recovery process by investigating the precise activity patterns of brain cells during skilled reaching movements that will be kinematically analyzed by novel automated tools. These brain-behavior correlations will generate fundamental knowledge about stroke recovery to inform new interventions that can reduce the burden of disability caused by stroke.",Motor cortex network dynamics driving stroke recovery,9983838,K08NS109315,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Animals ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Bioethics ', ' Biomedical Ethics ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Calcium ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Control Groups ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Forelimb ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Head ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Leadership ', ' Learning ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Motor Cortex ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Population Dynamics ', ' Publishing ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' rehab therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' rehabilitative therapy ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' Development and Research ', ' R & D ', ' R&D ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Somatosensory Cortex ', ' somesthetic sensory cortex ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' injuries ', ' Injury ', ' career ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Neuro rehabilitation ', ' Neurorehabilitation ', ' neurological rehab ', ' neurorehab ', ' neurological rehabilitation ', ' rehabilitation after stroke ', ' stroke rehab ', ' stroke rehabilitation ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Neurologist ', ' Recovery ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Development Plans ', ' Funding ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Investigation ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' joint mobility ', ' joint movement ', ' joint mobilization ', ' meetings ', ' brain cell ', ' experience ', ' sensory cortex ', ' nerve cell death ', ' nerve cell loss ', ' neuron cell death ', ' neuron cell loss ', ' neuron death ', ' neuronal cell death ', ' neuronal cell loss ', ' neuronal death ', ' neuronal loss ', ' neuron loss ', ' functional recovery ', ' Recovery of Function ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neuronal circuit ', ' neuronal circuitry ', ' kinematic model ', ' kinematics ', ' Manuscripts ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' career development ', ' stroke treatment ', ' treating stroke ', ' stroke therapy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Ischemic Stroke ', ' Membrum superius ', ' Upper Limb ', ' Upper Extremity ', ' Brain region ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' rehab research ', ' rehabilitation research ', ' Clinical Management ', ' Physiologic Imaging ', ' physiological imaging ', ' Functional Imaging ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' after stroke ', ' poststroke ', ' post stroke ', ' 2-photon ', ' two-photon ', ' stroke recovery ', ' network dysfunction ', ' Population ', ' neural mechanism ', ' neuromechanism ', ' Coupled ', ' Impairment ', ' brain behavior ', ' locomotor learning ', ' motor learning ', ' disability burden ', ' movement impairment ', ' movement limitation ', ' motor impairment ', ' restore function ', ' restore functionality ', ' restore lost function ', ' functional restoration ', ' responsible research conduct ', ' motor recovery ', ' DREADDs ', ' designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs ', ' imaging study ', ' recruit ', ' deep learning ', ' neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' motor behavior ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K08,2020,213840,CA-33,0.148595574740937
"Quantitative Rehabilitation after Stroke PROJECT SUMMARY Stroke causes significant disability, and recovery is often incomplete. In animal models of stroke, robust upper extremity (UE) motor recovery can be elicited if high doses of functional training are given early. In humans, however, the optimal training dose is unknown, because no quantitative dose-response trials have been undertaken in the first months after stroke. This deficiency stems from a lack of measurement instruments that can accurately and easily quantify UE functional training dose and recovery. To address this gap, this proposal will generate two new measurement tools to enable quantitative stroke recovery research. The first tool (Aim 1) will quantify the number of functional movements made during stroke rehabilitation, measuring UE training dose. The second tool (Aim 2) will quantify the abnormality of movements, measuring UE recovery and response to interventions. We will combine wireless motion capture and computational methodologies to create objective, precise, and user-friendly tools. Inertial measurement units, worn by individuals with stroke and healthy controls performing various activities, will capture upper body motion. In Aim 1, machine learning algorithms will be trained to identify and count functional movements in activities normally practiced during rehabilitation. In Aim 2, functional principal components analysis will quantify movement impairment and compensation in standardized motions. Validity will be determined by correlating tool outcomes with current gold standards. The proposed study will be conducted at New York University, in collaboration with investigators from the NYU Center for Data Science, Columbia University, and Washington University-St. Louis. Each have complementary expertise in machine learning, functional data analysis, and functional movement identification. This K02 Independent Scientist Award will provide the candidate with skill in advanced motion capture and analytical methodologies needed to study stroke rehabilitation and recovery. The career development plan includes personalized tutorials and coursework combined with longitudinal oversight of data analysis, providing an excellent foundation for launching an independent research career. Ultimately, the developed tools have the potential to immediately impact neurorehabilitation research, facilitating the rigorous dose-response trials so critically needed to change clinical practice and improve stroke outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health, because it will enable the precise and feasible measurement of rehabilitation and recovery after stroke.

"Point-of-Care CT Perfusion (PoC CT-P) for Early Stroke Assessment Abstract The goal of this SBIR Phase I project is to develop a portable and affordable cranial x-ray-based Computed Tomography Perfusion (CT-P) device for expedited front-line evaluation and triage of ischemic cerebral stroke victims. CT-P is the gold standard modality for assessment and classifying stroke patients to determine the best candidates for revascularizing procedures; however, CT-P is generally unavailable early in the current acute care treatment model. Unlike existing conventional CT-P equipment which is generally large, expensive, and stationary, the proposed device would be compact, portable, and affordable to be deployed in nursing homes, urgent care centers, hospital ER triage areas, ICUs, and EMS response vehicles, yet also provide sufficient time and contrast resolution for reliable perfusion metrics. Rapidly acquired point-of-care CT and CT-P images showing blood flow, volume, and transit times will enable (1) early classification of hemorrhage or ischemic, and (2) assessment of the recoverable brain tissue volume. This will enable early screening evaluation for appropriate acute stroke patient prioritization and routing. In addition, it may also provide an economical and safe bedside means of assessing cranial perfusion for follow up care in the ICU, recovery room, or even eventually in a residential care setting. Xoran Technologies LLC specializes in point-of-care (POC) medical imaging and has successfully marketed over 750 POC imaging devices in the US. Project Narrative When an individual is suffering from acute stroke, time is of the essence; however, it is critically important to assess the type of stroke as well as the amount and location of potentially recoverable brain tissue to determine the appropriate routing and priority to achieve the best outcome for that individual. In this project a new compact and portable device is proposed that allows cranial perfusion studies to be performed earlier in the process than the current standard of care, potentially in a nursing home, urgent care center, or in an emergency vehicle such as an ambulance. Public health is affected both by the potential for improved outcomes for individuals, but also for systemwide cost savings and efficiency gains by not transporting patients who are not likely to benefit from a trip to a level one stroke treatment center.",Point-of-Care CT Perfusion (PoC CT-P) for Early Stroke Assessment,10009036,R43NS117244,"['Affect ', ' Ambulances ', ' Cerebral Infarction ', ' cerebral infarct ', ' Cities ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Equipment ', ' Feedback ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Health care facility ', ' Health Facilities ', ' Healthcare Facility ', ' care facilities ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Bleeding ', ' blood loss ', ' Hospitals ', ' Infarction ', ' infarct ', ' Investments ', ' Ischemia ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' extended care ', ' longterm care ', ' Manuals ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Military Personnel ', ' Armed Forces Personnel ', ' Military ', ' neurosurgery ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' nursing home ', ' Ocular orbit ', ' Eye Socket ', ' Orbit ', ' Orbital Cavity ', ' Legal patent ', ' Patents ', ' Patients ', ' Perfusion ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Recovery Room ', ' Hospital Recovery Rooms ', ' Residential Treatment ', ' residential care ', ' Rotation ', ' Safety ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' CAT scan ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CT Xray ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' Xray CAT scan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' Xray computerized tomography ', ' catscan ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' computer tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computerized tomography ', ' Triage ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Vascularization ', ' Roentgen Rays ', ' X-Radiation ', ' X-Ray Radiation ', ' X-ray ', ' Xray ', ' Cost Savings ', ' Caring ', ' Teleradiology ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' rural region ', ' rural area ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Cranial ', ' Cephalic ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Evaluation ', ' disability ', ' Blood flow ', ' Individual ', ' cerebral ', ' Cerebrum ', ' radiologist ', ' ER Positive ', ' ER+ ', ' Estrogen receptor positive ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Hour ', ' Scanning ', ' Clinic ', ' Route ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' brain tissue ', ' Services ', ' phantom model ', ' novel ', ' Modality ', ' Devices ', ' acute cerebrovascular accident ', ' acute stroke ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' stroke treatment ', ' treating stroke ', ' stroke therapy ', ' portability ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Ischemic Stroke ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' Diameter ', ' Caliber ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Imaging Instrument ', ' Imaging Tool ', ' Imaging Device ', ' Resolution ', ' Slice ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' Process ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' point of care ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' treatment center ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' commercial application ', ' prototype ', ' standard of care ', ' product development ', ' arm ', ' urgent care ', ' contrast enhanced ', ' contrast imaging ', ' improved outcome ', ' stroke symptom ', ' perfusion imaging ', ' Cost efficiency ', ' early screening ', ' Service model ', ' care delivery model ', ' health care delivery model ', ' healthcare delivery model ', ' Service delivery model ', ' American Stroke Association ', ' stroke patient ', ' stroke victims ', ' imager ', ' functional independence ', ' acute care ', ' clinical center ', ' ']",NINDS,"XORAN TECHNOLOGIES, LLC",R43,2020,249154,MI-12,0.17873330687314223
"Plasma MicroRNA Biomarkers to Guide Rehabilitation Therapy After Stroke Abstract Following a stroke, each patient has a specific capacity to recover function that likely hinges on their ability to mount a neural repair response. Knowing this capacity early on would provide opportunities for personalized medicine in stroke rehabilitation. Physicians and therapists currently have few methods to predict recovery, and therefore have little data to guide decisions on treatment approach and length of stay. This has led to suboptimal therapy delivery. There is, however, emerging evidence to suggest that biomarkers can accurately predict recovery potential in order to guide therapy. Early attempts to improve motor recovery prediction used clinical, neurophysiologic (TMS), and MRI biomarkers to develop algorithms with up to 80% accuracy. While these are helpful, they tell us little about the biology of stroke recovery and are difficult to implement in most rehabilitation facilities. We recently identified a panel of 5 microRNAs (miRNAs) collected from plasma on rehab admission that can predict motor recovery with 95% accuracy. These 5 miRNAs converge on axonal guidance and developmental biology pathways. We therefore suspect that they capture the potential to mount a neural repair response after stroke. The overall goal of the proposal is to refine this miRNA predictive panel using a larger number of samples from 3 studies, test it’s predictive / analytic qualities, and validate the predictive panel in a large prospective study. R61 Phase Specific Aims: Aim #1a. Analyze stroke samples from 3 independent studies and matched controls using discovery-based qRT-PCR. Aim #1b. Use machine learning to develop a miRNA panel with ≥ 80% predictive ability across the 3 studies to identify patients who achieve excellent, moderate, and poor motor recovery by 3-12 months, controlling for covariates. Aim #1c. Develop custom qRT-PCR cards that include ~10 miRNAs in the refined panel in triplicate along with endogenous controls. Perform analytic validation to gauge precision, accuracy, and ideal handling / storage. R33 Phase Specific Aims: Aim #2a. Prospectively validate the miRNA panel by collecting samples from patients with upper limb impairment admitted to 2 inpatient rehab facilities, testing sensitivity, specificity, and positive/negative predictive value for classifying excellent, moderate, and poor motor recovery at 6 months. Aim #2b Give the predicted recovery potential score to the treatment team upon patient discharge from the inpatient rehabilitation facility. Use regression and chi-squared tests to assess how having this information on the day of admission would have changed percent of time delivering specific therapies and recommended length of stay. Tailoring rehabilitation treatment to the individual’s biological capacity to recover may lead to greater independence and lower costs. Specifically, evidence suggests that delivering more restorative-type therapy to the subset of patients most likely to respond improves motor outcomes. Just as important, the miRNAs identified in the panel will become treatment targets for recovery-based therapeutics. Project Narrative This project will use qRT-PCR to analyze plasma samples collected from stroke patients to develop a microRNA-based motor recovery potential score. This score will undergo clinical validation as a tool to tailor rehabilitation therapy delivery for individual stroke patients at inpatient rehabilitation facilities based on their predicted level of motor recovery. Once validated, the score will be used in future studies to streamline therapy delivery and improve outcomes.",Plasma MicroRNA Biomarkers to Guide Rehabilitation Therapy After Stroke,10008023,R61NS117196,"['Algorithms ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Biology ', ' Blood Circulation ', ' Bloodstream ', ' Circulation ', ' Chi-Square Tests ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Developmental Biology ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' Inpatients ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' hospital days ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' Methods ', ' Michigan ', ' Molecular Biology ', ' DNA Molecular Biology ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Patient Discharge ', ' Discharge from Health Care Facility ', ' Discharge from Healthcare Facility ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Plasma ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' rehab therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' rehabilitative therapy ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' rehabilitation after stroke ', ' stroke rehab ', ' stroke rehabilitation ', ' Clinical ', ' repair ', ' repaired ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' restoration ', ' Test Result ', ' cohort ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Micro RNA ', ' miRNA ', ' miRNAs ', ' MicroRNAs ', ' Membrum superius ', ' Upper Limb ', ' Upper Extremity ', ' axon growth cone guidance ', ' axon guidance ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Quantitative RTPCR ', ' qRTPCR ', ' Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR ', ' Validation ', ' Preparation ', ' Process ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' after stroke ', ' poststroke ', ' post stroke ', ' cost ', ' stroke recovery ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' Impairment ', ' movement impairment ', ' movement limitation ', ' motor impairment ', ' molecular biomarker ', ' molecular marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' Regimen ', ' arm ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' precision medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized medicine ', ' imaging marker ', ' imaging-based biological marker ', ' imaging-based biomarker ', ' imaging-based marker ', ' imaging biomarker ', ' motor recovery ', ' Predictive Analytics ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' outcome prediction ', ' improved outcome ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' patient subsets ', ' miRNA biomarkers ', ' miRNA markers ', ' microRNA markers ', ' microRNA biomarkers ', ' MRI biomarker ', ' magnetic resonance imaging biomarker ', ' stroke patient ', ' predictive panel ', ' ']",NINDS,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R61,2020,969858,DC-98,0.12646707219111564
"Prehospital Diagnostic Biomarker for Large Vessel Occlusion Background: The incidence of Large Vessel Acute Ischemic Stroke (AIS) has been estimated to be approximately 250,000 patients per year in the United States and is the leading cause of disability and fifth leading cause of death. Although interventional (stentriever) and pharmaceutical (tPA) treatments exist for large vessel occlusion (LVO), their use is limited due to the short time window from symptom onset that these treatments are indicated to be administered in. Moreover, recent estimates suggest only approximately 10% of eligible patients receive interventional treatment which has shown to lead to better outcomes in several worldwide RCTs. In order for intervention to be successful, a standardized, quantitative, field based (pre- hospital) diagnostic tool is needed to improve LVO identification and ensure rapid transfer to a capable medical facility. Currently, the gold standard for stroke diagnosis is CT angiogram (CTA) which is limited to in-hospital use or a low number of mobile stroke ambulances, all costing multi-millions of dollars, requiring expert operators and IV injection of iodine-rich contrast material. Additionally, the clinical stroke assessment scales (RACE, LAMS, CPSS) used in the field although low cost and non-invasive have proven unreliable due to training requirements and low inherent accuracies, with SEN and SPE ranging in a recent study from 0.50-0.64 and 0.83-0.92, respectively. Project Goals and Broad Specific Aims: Validate a biomarker for LVO assessment which can be measured and displayed with a fully automated, non-invasive, transcranial Doppler (TCD) robotic system with performance at or exceeding 90% ROC–AUC (targeting SEN & SPE greater than 90%) to standard of care imaging. Complete a clinical study where Arm 1 demonstrates technical feasibility of the system in acute stroke settings and Arm 2 demonstrates safety, no detrimental change to standard of care, and collect robust data to submit to the FDA an IFU expansion to drive clinical care using our robotic system and the biomarker. The ultimate and future goal of this work is to use the automated device and validated VCI biomarker in a prehospital setting to show improved clinical outcomes after stroke onset due to improved prehospital triage. This work is critical to first validate the biomarker against gold standard CTA, which must be completed in a hospital, to ultimately be used in the pre-hospital setting. Longterm Objective: CTA will not be replaced in comprehensive stroke centers and we do not aim to use our technology to do this in comprehensive centers with CTA. Instead, our technology will be available in centers without CTA or MRA and ultimately in the prehospital environment. The goal of our company is to show that our lower cost, portable, non invasive technology can be used to measure a valid biomarker of large vessel occlusion that can be performed outside of a comprehensive stroke center. The first step is to validate the biomarker, in a center with CTA as a gold standard, which is the ultimate goal of this work.

"Patient-centered rehabilitation and dexterous assistive devices for stroke patients using bionic exoskeletons controlled by non-invasive electromyography PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Stroke is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide and the most common stroke-related impairment is upper-limb hemiparesis, affecting 80% of stroke patients acutely and 40% chronically. Full recovery is unlikely with current rehabilitation approaches, and as a result, stroke reduces quality of life, increases healthcare costs, and burdens caregivers. The long-term goal of this project is to leverage assistive bionic devices to restore motor function and promote long-term neuro-regeneration, ultimately replacing more expensive and less effective rehabilitation approaches with a patient-centered rehabilitation strategy. The objective of this proposal is to control assistive bionic exoskeletons and quantify stroke recovery with electromyographic (EMG) recordings of residual muscle activity from the paretic arm. Our central hypothesis is that an EMG-controlled powered orthosis – that assists individuals in activities of daily living – can be used as a patient-specific rehabilitative tool that improves stroke recovery. Aim 1 will adapt dexterous EMG-control algorithms for upper-limb orthoses, and then demonstrate improved hand dexterity and functional mobility for stroke patients. Aim 2 will utilize large EMG datasets over time to precisely quantify changes in muscle strength and spasticity throughout recovery and to provide robust long-term control of assistive devices via deep learning. Aim 3 consists of a pilot study to determine the feasibility of patient-specific assistive-device-driven rehabilitation. The proposed research is innovative because it will address gaps in knowledge critical to merging assistive and rehabilitative devices. These findings are significant because they will enable devices that can immediately and simultaneously promote usage, strengthen muscles, and provide closed-loop visual feedback – thereby merging multiple effective rehabilitation strategies into a single holistic approach. This proposal will have a positive impact on society by increasing rehabilitation compliance, promoting independence and improving recovery outcomes for stroke patients, ultimately reducing healthcare costs and improving patients’ quality of life. PROJECT NARRATIVE / PUBLIC HEALTH STATEMENT This project aims to bridge the gap between assistive devices and rehabilitative tools so that stroke patients with a paretic arm can immediately return to their daily routine and use their activities of daily living as a patient-specific rehabilitation strategy. Assistive bionic exoskeletons will be intuitively controlled with residual muscle activity from the paretic arm, and artificial intelligence will elucidate underlying muscle impairment, improve the dexterity of bionic devices, and temporarily assist and rehabilitate stroke patients. This proposal is relevant to NIH’s mission because it has strong potential to improve quality of life for stroke patients and their caregivers, as well as reduce overall healthcare costs.",Patient-centered rehabilitation and dexterous assistive devices for stroke patients using bionic exoskeletons controlled by non-invasive electromyography,10017601,DP5OD029571,"['Activities of Daily Living ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' daily living functionality ', ' functional ability ', ' functional capacity ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Award ', ' Bionics ', ' Electromyography ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Hand ', ' Hospitals ', ' Leadership ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Mission ', ' Muscle Spasticity ', ' Muscle ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' muscular ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Nerve Regeneration ', ' Neuro-regeneration ', ' Neuronal regeneration ', ' Neuroregeneration ', ' nervous system regeneration ', ' neural regeneration ', ' neuroregenerative ', ' regenerated nerve ', ' Neuromuscular Diseases ', ' myoneural disorder ', ' neuromuscular degenerative disorder ', ' neuromuscular disorder ', ' Orthotic Devices ', ' Orthosis ', ' orthotics ', ' Paresis ', ' Muscle Paresis ', ' Muscular Paresis ', ' paretic ', ' paretic muscle ', ' Patients ', ' Physical Medicine ', ' Physiatrics ', ' Physiatry ', ' Rehabilitation Medicine ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' rehab therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' rehabilitative therapy ', ' Rehabilitation Centers ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Research Technics ', ' Research Techniques ', ' Running ', ' Self-Help Devices ', ' Assistive Technology ', ' assisted device ', ' assistive device ', ' Societies ', ' Spinal cord injury ', ' Spinal Cord Trauma ', ' Spinal Trauma ', ' Spinal cord injured ', ' Traumatic Myelopathy ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Students ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Utah ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' symposium ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Neuro rehabilitation ', ' Neurorehabilitation ', ' neurological rehab ', ' neurorehab ', ' neurological rehabilitation ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Residual ', ' Residual state ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Intuition ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Development Plans ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Event ', ' System ', ' muscle strength ', ' Postdoc ', ' Research Associate ', ' post-doc ', ' post-doctoral ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' Services ', ' handbook ', ' exoskeletal ', ' exoskeleton ', ' visual feedback ', ' professor ', ' high-end computing ', ' High Performance Computing ', ' Manuscripts ', ' Agreement ', ' graduate student ', ' holistic approach ', ' Devices ', ' social ', ' career development ', ' Care giver Burden ', ' care giver stress ', ' caregiver stress ', ' Caregiver Burden ', ' muscle strengthening ', ' resistance training ', ' strength training ', ' Brain Trauma ', ' traumatic brain damage ', ' Traumatic Brain Injury ', ' lecturer ', ' Membrum superius ', ' Upper Limb ', ' Upper Extremity ', ' BCL2-Interacting Protein ', ' DP5 ', ' Harakiri ', ' HRK gene ', ' Address ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Human Subject Research ', ' Motor ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Research ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' after stroke ', ' poststroke ', ' post stroke ', ' stroke recovery ', ' rehab device ', ' Rehabilitation device ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' upper limb hemiparesis ', ' hemiparetic stroke ', ' rehab strategy ', ' rehabilitation strategy ', ' restore function ', ' restore functionality ', ' restore lost function ', ' functional restoration ', ' Secure ', ' undergraduate ', ' undergraduate student ', ' dexterity ', ' data visualization ', ' paretic arm ', ' arm paresis ', ' faculty mentor ', ' tenure process ', ' tenure track ', ' stroke patient ', ' stroke outcome ', ' deep learning ', ' ']",OD,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,DP5,2020,327385,UT-02,0.18534921810601243
"Non-invasive Evaluation of Intracranial Atherosclerotic Disease Using Hemodynamic Biomarkers The proposed study will be based on a multimodal approach using 4D flow MRI, perfusion-weighted MRI (PWI), diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) and high-resolution vessel wall imaging (VWI) together with patient information (demographics and clinical factors) to predict the risk of recurrent stroke of patients with intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD) stenosis. This will allow integrating the vulnerability of the stenosis as well as the patient by assessing the hemodynamic impact, plaque stability, and stroke lesion pattern together with patient information into a prediction model. PWI will provide tissue perfusion, VWI will provide plaque stability, DWI will provide stroke lesion pattern and 4D flow MRI will provide macroscopic hemodynamics of the circle of Willis (CoW). We will concentrate on the following innovative developments: 4D flow MRI: In order to allow 4D flow MRI scanning with a high dynamic velocity range (necessary to measure slow and fast velocities simultaneously), we recently developed dual-venc 4D flow MRI. However, this method suffers from extended scan tome of an already long acquisition. We, therefore, aim to minimize scan time for dual-venc 4D flow MRI scan while using the required spatial resolution and volume coverage, targeting 5-10 minutes so that this sequence can be added to clinical protocols. We aim to achieve this by integrating compressed sensing acceleration. Rigorous testing of the sequence will be done in phantom experiments as well as in a healthy test-retest control study. Data Analysis and Outcome Prediction: Currently, the multi-modal information that can be acquired with MRI has not been combined and used for comprehensive prediction of recurrent stroke risk in ICAD. Information that can be acquired from different MRI modalities may be critical in characterizing ICAD patient status. We will develop a new analysis tool that combines all data into a single network graph. All imaging data will be reported relative to supplying the intracranial artery of the CoW by using the vascular territory region of interest analysis. This will allow gathering all imaging parameters in a network graph. In a cross-sectional patient study, we will use combined data to see if it enables differentiation between healthy subjects, ICAD subgroups. Patient Study: In Aim 3, we will develop a machine-learning algorithm to predict which of the patients are at risk of experiencing a recurrent stroke. In order to achieve this, we will enroll a total of 150 ICAD patients from two institutions (Northwestern Memorial Hospital and San Francisco General Hospital). The combined data from the four different MR modalities and all other patient information will be used to identify only the discriminative features. This will be realized by using support vector machine recursive feature elimination to rank features associated with the risk of an ischemic event. The SVM will be trained and tested using information from the patient's clinical follow-up as outcome measure. The outcome (ischemic event or death yes/no)) will enable the development of the SVM classifier to predict outcome. Project Narrative (2 – 3 sentences) In the proposed study, we will develop an advanced intracranial MRI protocol together with a comprehensive image processing pipeline allowing full characterization of intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD). Imaging biomarkers together with clinical and demographic factors will enable the identification of patients at risk to suffer recurring stroke. Machine learning methods will be used to predict risk. Successful completion will allow for better identification of patients who could benefit from endovascular stenting to reduce stroke recurrence.",Non-invasive Evaluation of Intracranial

"Noninvasive Real-time Estimation of Cerebral Blood Flow for Personalized Stroke Assessment PROJECT SUMMARY Stroke is the second leading cause of death and the third leading cause of disability worldwide. Similar trends exist in the U.S., where it is estimated that every 40 seconds a stroke occurs, leading to a stroke-related death every 4 minutes. Afflicting approximately 800,000 Americans each year, time sensitive and widely practicable diagnostic algorithms are paramount. Despite increasing emphasis on the significance of blood flow characteristics in pursuing strokes, estimating regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) inside the skull is no trivial task. Imaging techniques that provide rCBF distribution may be unavailable due to time constraint or access to facilities, or simply the expenses attached to it. In our preliminary studies, we have developed a model that can give blood flow estimates in real-time for the entire brain vasculature. Here, we propose a novel hybrid computational model that utilizes high-performance computing and machine learning to simulate the entire brain vasculature, as well as provide real time measures of regional CBF. We will use novel mathematical methods to determine the vascular geometry of each subject using our existing imaging database that includes CTA and CBF images from stroke patients, and will subsequently validate our simulations against the same dataset. Finally, we will use machine learning algorithms to extract patterns in stroke patients' blood flow and give estimates for stroke severity predictors on patient- specific measurements. PROJECT NARRATIVE The objective of this project is to estimate blood flow properties in the brain and its correlation with stroke. We will simulate and validate a model to give similar information as the expensive perfusion scanning measurements.

"Antiplatelet in Stroke:  Safety and Effectiveness in Seniors (ASSESS) The current U.S. and European guidelines recommend antiplatelet therapy such as aspirin, clopidogrel, or dual antiplatelet therapy to reduce the risk of recurrent ischemic events in patients with noncardioembolic ischemic stroke. However, selection of antiplatelet agents can be a difficult decision to make for older patients. Not only older individuals are at increased risk for recurrent strokes, they also face risk for bleeding complications. While it is known that drug selection should be individualized, it remains unknown how to tailor antiplatelet therapy according to patient unique characteristics, preferences, needs, and values. The long-term goal is to use com- parative effectiveness research to improve primary and secondary prevention in cardiovascular disease and stroke. Leveraging the American Heart Association (AHA) Get With The Guidelines Stroke (GWTG) registry and Medicare claims, the overall objective in this application is to develop patient-centered evidence-based strategies to improve antiplatelet treatment selection for older individuals presenting with noncardioembolic ischemic stroke. The central hypothesis is that individuals differ in many characteristics, such as age, sex, presence of comorbid- ities, or concurrent medications, which can influence the potential benefits and harms associated with the treat- ment. Once the variability in response to treatment is known, selection of an antiplatelet agent can be made based on patient risk profiles, preferences, and known efficacy/safety of the agents, making treatment both safer and more effective. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) determine the long-term clinical effectiveness of different antiplatelet regimens in patients with noncar- dioembolic ischemic stroke; 2) determine the long-term safety of different antiplatelet regimens; and 3) balance benefits and harms of each antiplatelet regimen while incorporating patient preferences into decision-making. The proposed research is innovative in four key ways: 1) a patient-centered approach is used to address a real- life decisional dilemma facing stroke survivors and clinicians; 2) it shifts focus from selected samples in clinical trials to nationwide representative stroke population, including traditionally underrepresented subgroups in com- munity practice; 3) novel propensity score inverse probability weighting method using generalized boosted mod- els (a machine learning technique) will be employed to mimic a trial-type multi-treatment design, uncover treat- ment heterogeneity, and minimize selection bias in observational data; 4) beyond traditional mechanisms of scientific publications, the evidence generated from this study will be disseminated to stroke survivors, clinicians, and relevant stakeholders through the AHA GWTG-led national quality initiatives and patient-led efforts to insure a rapid translation of seminal findings into clinical practice. The proposed research is significant, because it is expected to help guide personalized antiplatelet therapy in older ischemic stroke survivors that could best meet their needs and lead to better outcomes most meaningful to patients. Ultimately, such knowledge has the poten- tial to inform evidence-based treatment decisions in stroke that now afflicts more than 7.2 million Americans. The proposed research will develop patient-centered evidence-based strategies to improve antiplatelet treatment selection for older individuals presenting with noncardioembolic ischemic stroke. It is relevant to public health because the development and adoption of personalized evidence-based antiplatelet therapy is expected to re- duce recurrent ischemic events, minimize treatment complications, and improve outcomes most meaningful to patients.

"Smartwatch Monitoring for Atrial Fibrillation After Stroke Project Summary / Abstract Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the world’s most common serious heart rhythm problem and causes 15% of all strokes, a major cause of disability and death among Americans. Long-term monitoring for early AF detection and treatment is recommended for many stroke patients, but although existing cardiac monitors are accurate, they suffer from methodologic and cost limitations that preclude their long-term use. In the proposed, “Smartwatch Monitoring for Atrial Fibrillation Real-Time in Stroke,” Study, our overall objective is to enhance paroxysmal AF (pAF) detection by enhancing and testing Pulsewatch, an innovative, smartwatch-based technology for long-term rhythm monitoring of stroke patients. For Aim 1, we embed our state-of-the art AF detection algorithms, interactive messaging to promote adherence, and novel contact and motion noise correction capabilities into a smartwatch to enable near-continuous pulse waveform analysis. We will further refine Pulsewatch through focus groups and a Hack-a-thon with stroke patients and their medical providers. For Aim 2, we will enroll 90 stroke survivors and provide them with a smartphone and smartwatch, both encoded with Pulsewatch. We will compare the performance of Pulsewatch when worn daily for 7 days to conventional 7-day cardiac monitoring for pAF detection. For Aim 3, we will determine the acceptability and usability of Pulsewatch through follow-up interviews and focus groups in 30 randomly selected participants from Aim 2 asked to continue wearing smartwatch daily for an additional 30 days. We will identify patient factors associated with adherence and evaluate the impact of Pulsewatch use on disease-specific quality of life, anxiety, and self- activation among the 30 users compared to 30 stroke patients treated with usual care through baseline and 1- month assessments. Our research will lead to the development of a highly acceptable, enabling cardiovascular monitoring technology designed by, and for, stroke patients that facilitates long-term non-invasive screening for pAF, as well as communication between stroke patients and their medical providers.

"A Machine Learning Approach to Classifying Time Since Stroke using Medical Imaging PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Stroke is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in the United States, with approximately 795,000 Americans experiencing a new or recurrent stroke each year. Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV tPA) is the dominant and most proven treatment option, but its use is only indicated within 4.5 hours following a stroke. Unfortunately, up to 30% of stroke patients present with an unknown time since stroke (TSS) symptom onset, which makes them ineligible to receive IV tPA. Many of these individuals could be spared severe morbidity or mortality if there existed an alternative method for establishing TSS, allowing them to be identified and treated. This proposal will develop machine learning methods to create a physiologically grounded method for predicting TSS based on multiparametric magnetic resonance (MR) and computed tomography (CT) imaging data. We believe our proposed techniques will outperform state-of-the-art methods that are based on subjective image interpretation, and have the potential to provide an objective data point that may be used in conjunction with the subjective assessments of experts, or in clinical environments that lack expertise in stroke imaging Research has established that MR and CT imaging captures information that correlates with TSS. However, existing methods for extracting this information are based on a physician subjectively interpreting the images and delineating regions of interest, processes that have been documented to have only weak to moderate agreement across trained expert reviewers. An automated approach that comprehensively analyzes the spectrum of imaging data could identify complex relationships across channels that more accurately classify TSS. For example, in MR, diffusion-weighted, perfusion-weighted, and fluid attenuated inversion recovery imaging all play important roles in characterizing a stroke, but a deep understanding of how each channel may be combined to describe TSS is unknown. We propose to establish new deep learning methods for fusing this information. Specifically, we will: 1) develop a machine learning framework for classifying TSS; 2) develop a deep convolutional autoencoder to generate novel multimodal image representations from MR and CT to improve classification; and 3) implement visualization techniques that elucidate the relationship between deep features and pathophysiological stroke processes. Under this project, we will use data from the UCLA and UCI Stroke Centers, allowing us to study different patient populations and imaging techniques. The successful completion of this research will provide a new method for estimating TSS from imaging, leading to new prospective trials for providing therapy to patients with unknown TSS.

"Data Harmonization PROJECT SUMMARY Stroke is the fifth most prevalent cause of death in the U.S. afflicting nearly 800,000 per year. About three quarters of strokes are first events, underscoring the importance of primary prevention. Designing optimal preventive strategies requires identification of risk factors and estimation of the risk of stroke. The most recent American Heart Association (AHA)/American Stroke Association Guidelines for the Primary Prevention of Stroke conclude that “an ideal stroke risk assessment tool that is simple, is widely applicable and accepted, and takes into account the effects of multiple risk factors does not exist.” One of the most commonly recommended predictive models is the Framingham Stroke Profile, developed and updated more than 25 years ago. Newer models have been proposed (including the Self-Reported Stroke Risk Stratification tool from the REGARDS study) but have not been thoroughly validated. Consequently, the Primary Prevention of Stroke guidelines call for more research “to validate risk assessment tools across age, sex, and race/ethnic groups” and “to evaluate whether any of the more recently identified risk factors add to the predictive accuracy of existing scales”. We propose to address these gaps by aggregating and harmonizing existing patient-level data collected as part of longitudinal cohort studies supported by the NINDS and NHLBI. The data will be obtained through a partnership with the coordinating center for the REGARDS Study at the University of Alabama at Birmingham and by a request submitted to the NIH dbGap repository to obtain data from the Framingham Offspring, ARIC and MESA cohorts. At the same time, we will expand the advanced machine learning techniques developed as part of our currently funded NIH BD2K award to Duke. We will apply these models to the harmonized data to facilitate development and validation of prediction tool for primary strokes. These complex analyses will require advanced computational resources that will utilize the AHA's Precision Medicine Platform (PMP), built based on Amazon Web Services.

"Precision blood pressure management after endovascular stroke therapy based on real-time autoregulation measurements Abstract The following K23 proposal is for Dr. Nils Petersen, a Neurocritical Care and Stroke Neurologist at Yale-New Haven Hospital, and Assistant Professor at Yale University School of Medicine. Dr. Petersen is a physician- scientist with specialized knowledge of human cerebral hemodynamics who is investigating personalized, autoregulation-guided blood pressure management after ischemic stroke. About 40% of patients with ischemic stroke due to intracranial large-vessel occlusion (LVO) are rendered non-ambulatory, bedridden or deceased despite treatment with endovascular thrombectomy. Abnormalities in cerebrovascular autoregulation in the acute phase of LVO stroke increase the risk of secondary brain injury from relative cerebral hypo- or hyperperfusion. Thus, autoregulation-guided, personalized blood pressure management presents a promising alternative to the current practice of targeting fixed thresholds. By providing a more favorable physiologic environment for the injured brain, the autoregulation-guided approach may reduce secondary brain injury and improve outcomes. Preliminary data obtained by Dr. Petersen have demonstrated the feasibility of a research plan that uses near- infrared spectroscopy and real-time data processing to identify a patient-specific blood pressure range that yields optimal brain blood flow. This research proposal will evaluate if blood pressure management outside personalized limits of autoregulation increases the risk for neurologic worsening from infarct progression or hemorrhagic transformation, leading to increased rates of unfavorable outcome (Aim 1). Next, Dr. Petersen will evaluate the effectiveness of therapeutic blood pressure interventions and explore the feasibility of an intervention protocol targeting a personalized blood pressure range (Aim 2). Under the expert mentorship of Dr. Kevin Sheth, Chief of Neurocritical Care, Dr. Randolph Marshall, Director of Stroke Division at Columbia University, and Dr. Cynthia Brandt, Director of Medical Informatics, this K23 award will allow Dr. Petersen 1) to acquire skills in informatics, advanced signal processing and machine learning in order to enhance current methods of quantifying cerebral autoregulation, 2) to develop expertise in clinical trial design, 3) to build a research group dedicated to discovery and clinical evaluation of physiology-based individualized treatment strategies after stroke, and 4) to foster inter-institutional collaboration and data-sharing. This proposal will leverage Yale’s cutting-edge neuro-monitoring technologies along with extensive informatics and research resources from the Yale Center for Clinical Investigation to generate new insights into cerebral hemodynamics and identify treatment opportunities. At the conclusion of this award period, Dr. Petersen will be well-positioned to become an independently-funded investigator conducting high-quality research in the area of cerebral hemodynamics. His long-term goal is to use neuro-monitoring to develop physiology-based, personalized, early interventions to reduce the disability and morbidity associated with stroke. Narrative Project Narrative/Public Health Relevance: Stroke is the leading cause of disability in the United States, and this research proposal addresses the NIH mission to reduce the burden of neurological disorders and enhance the quality of life of people with disability. Current stroke treatments are primarily aimed at treating blockage of blood vessels but are only partially effective, leaving a great need for additional adjunctive therapies. Effective blood pressure management tailored to individual patients, with the aim of maintaining optimal brain blood flow, may prevent additional brain injury, and is an important first-step towards personalized medicine in stroke.",Precision blood pressure management after endovascular stroke therapy based on real-time autoregulation measurements,9977426,K23NS110980,"['Algorithms ', ' Award ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Cerebral Edema ', ' Cerebrovascular Circulation ', ' brain blood flow ', ' cerebral blood flow ', ' cerebral circulation ', ' cerebrocirculation ', ' cerebrovascular blood flow ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Environment ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Handicapped ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' disabled ', ' disabled individual ', ' disabled people ', ' individuals with disabilities ', ' hemodynamics ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Bleeding ', ' blood loss ', ' Homeostasis ', ' Autoregulation ', ' Physiological Homeostasis ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Infarction ', ' infarct ', ' Physician Executives ', ' Medical Directors ', ' Medical Informatics ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity -

"Data-driven subtyping to find patients with drug interactions leading to stroke Project Summary Stroke is a highly heterogeneous and complex disease and is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Identification of the cause of disease is essential for risk stratification and optimal treatment, but can be difficult, as up to 35% of causes are undetermined by traditional subtyping criteria and very few causative genetic variants have been found. In addition, certain causes may be hidden within the clinical picture of a patient, such as an adverse drug reaction. Using data-driven approaches to analyze the medical records of patients may uncover novel patterns of risk factors and clinical features leading to stroke. The long-term goal of this research is to identify novel subtypes of highly heterogeneous diseases such as stroke and to reduce the genetic heterogeneity of a disease cohort by identifying patients with the same subtype. The objective of this application is to propose a pipeline that applies a data-driven analysis of medical notes to identify novel subtypes of stroke, focus on a subtype caused by an adverse drug reaction or drug pair interaction, validate the subtype in a genotyped study cohort, and look for gene variant enrichment in this cohort. This application’s central hypothesis is that applying deep learning to the electronic health record (EHR) of acute ischemic stroke patients will form subtypes based on more granular information than currently implemented and with reduced genetic heterogeneity by identifying novel patterns of risk factors and clinical picture leading to the stroke. In addition, we hypothesize that at least one subtype will identify patients whose stroke is an adverse drug reaction or drug-drug interaction. To do this, Aim 1 will first identify all acute ischemic stroke patients in the EHR by developing a machine learning classifier trained on structured data in the EHR. Aim 2 will then build and train an unsupervised deep learning algorithm on text from medical notes to identify clusters, or subtypes, of patients with similar clinical pictures. Aim 3 will finally validate reduction in genetic heterogeneity of these cohorts by estimating observational heritability of all subtypes using a tool created in our lab and comparing this with the heritability estimates of subtypes derived from physician-based criteria. It will also focus on a not well-studied subtype, stroke due to an adverse drug reaction or drug-drug interaction, by identifying its enrichment in the novel subtypes, validating this subtype in a study cohort with genotyped data, and finally looking for enrichment of pharmacogenetic variants in this subtype. These aims will generate a computational pipeline that identifies novel subtypes of acute ischemic stroke, enabling improved future genetic studies by reducing genetic heterogeneity of cohorts and improved understanding of the underlying causes of the disease. Project Narrative Stroke is a highly complex disease that is a leading cause of death and severe disability. Identifying the cause of stroke is essential for risk stratification and optimal treatment, but up to a third of cases are of undetermined cause, and very few genetic variants have been identified due to the heterogeneity of the disease. To address this, this research proposal develops a computational pipeline that applies data-driven deep learning to medical notes to identify novel combinations of environmental, genetic, and medical risk factors causing the disease; this tool may clarify the etiology of unknown stroke cases, provide cohorts of patients enriched with similar genetic variants, and be expanded to subtype any disease.",Data-driven subtyping to find patients with drug interactions leading to stroke,9999028,F30HL140946,"['Algorithms ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cerebrovascular Disorders ', ' Brain Vascular Disorders ', ' Cerebrovascular Disease ', ' Intracranial Vascular Diseases ', ' Intracranial Vascular Disorders ', ' brain vascular disease ', ' brain vascular dysfunction ', ' cerebral vascular disease ', ' cerebral vascular dysfunction ', ' cerebrovascular dysfunction ', ' intracranial vascular dysfunction ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Electrocardiogram ', ' ECG ', ' EKG ', ' Electrocardiography ', ' Future ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Bleeding ', ' blood loss ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Manuals ', ' Medical Records ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Nervous System Physiology ', ' Neurologic function ', ' Neurological function ', ' nervous system function ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacogenetics ', ' Physicians ', ' Probability ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' General Radiology ', ' Radiology ', ' Research ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Semantics ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Technology ', ' United States ', ' falls ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Blood flow ', ' Genetic Heterogeneity ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Internet ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Categories ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Drug Interactions ', ' Reporting ', ' acute cerebrovascular accident ', ' acute stroke ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' inherited factor ', ' genetic risk factor ', ' Modeling ', ' case control ', ' Ischemic Stroke ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' stroke recovery ', ' Heritability ', ' patient population ', ' population based ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' Genetic study ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' learning strategy ', ' disease heterogeneity ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' patient subsets ', ' Risk stratification ', ' optimal therapies ', ' optimal treatments ', ' stroke patient ', ' deep learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' random forest ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' supervised learning ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' automated analysis ', ' adverse drug reaction ', ' learning algorithm ', ' structured data ', ' computational pipelines ', ' learning classifier ', ' machine learning method ', ' patient health record ', ' patient medical record ', ' patient health information ', ' ']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,F30,2020,45880,NY-13,0.2067276826053077
"Shaping Neural Population Dynamics to Facilitate Learning Project Summary Behavior and cognition emerge from the coordinated activity of populations of interacting neurons. To change behavior we must change the architecture of the network that drives behavior. What are the rules whereby the activity of populations of neurons can change during learning? If we could observe the neural population dynamics that underlie skill learning, we might be able to facilitate learning. This ability may eventually lead to improvements to neurally- based rehabilitation strategies that can facilitate the recovery from stroke.  We will use a neurofeedback paradigm to shape the neural population dynamics that underlie skill learning. To do this, we will record the activity of dozens of neurons in the motor cortex of Rhesus monkey subjects. Animals will control a cursor on a computer screen by generating neural command signals. This is neurofeedback because the animal directly observes a projection of his neural activity, in the form of the movement of the onscreen cursor. This paradigm allows us to study learning simply by perturbing the mapping from neural activity to cursor movement on the screen. Following such a perturbation the animal must discover how to generate new patterns of neural activity that are now appropriate to restore good control of the onscreen cursor.  We will ask two linked questions. First, how does the animal learn to generate new patterns of neural activity? And second, can we facilitate that process? Neurofeedback-based learning offers complementary advantages to arm movements for studying the neural population dynamics that accompany learning. Chieﬂy, only in a neurofeedback paradigm can we be certain that the learning-induced changes in neural activity we observe matter directly for behavior, because only the neurons we record directly impact behavior in this paradigm.  We will test classic theories of skill learning, converted into speciﬁc hypotheses about how neural activity patterns will change throughout the multi-day course of skill learning.  If our neurofeedback-based incremental training schemes do facilitate learning, then this research will inform the work of rehabilitation specialists who work with stroke patients. We (and others) believe that if neurofeedback-based therapies are coupled with standard behavioral therapies for stroke, rehabilitation outcomes will improve. Project Narrative Stroke can be a debilitating condition. Only ﬁfty percent of stroke survivors make a full recovery, and that is usually only after extensive rehabilitation. The recovery from stroke and skill learning are probably closely related. We propose to develop brain-computer interface neurofeedback paradigms to facilitate the learning of new skills. If this is effective in our animal subjects it will provide new avenues to explore for stroke rehabilitation.",Shaping Neural Population Dynamics to Facilitate Learning,9900034,R01HD071686,"['Animals ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cognition ', ' Computers ', ' Electrodes ', ' Exhibits ', ' Goals ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Macaca mulatta ', ' M mulatta ', ' M. mulatta ', ' Rhesus Macaque ', ' Rhesus Monkey ', ' Monkeys ', ' Motor Cortex ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Population Dynamics ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' rehab therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' rehabilitative therapy ', ' Research ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Specialist ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' rehabilitation after stroke ', ' stroke rehab ', ' stroke rehabilitation ', ' Clinical ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' Recovery ', ' Couples Therapy ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' restoration ', ' behavior change ', ' Performance ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Rehabilitation Outcome ', ' skills ', ' Nervous System Injuries ', ' Nervous System damage ', ' Neurological Damage ', ' Neurological Injury ', ' Neurological trauma ', ' neurotrauma ', ' Nervous System Trauma ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' theories ', ' Control Animal ', ' Data ', ' Scheme ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' after stroke ', ' poststroke ', ' post stroke ', ' forging ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' stroke recovery ', ' Outcome ', ' brain computer interface ', ' Population ', ' neural mechanism ', ' neuromechanism ', ' locomotor learning ', ' motor learning ', ' rehab strategy ', ' rehabilitation strategy ', ' restore function ', ' restore functionality ', ' restore lost function ', ' functional restoration ', ' neural patterning ', ' neurofeedback ', ' network architecture ', ' multielectrode arrays ', ' multi-electrode arrays ', ' arm movement ', ' Learning Skill ', ' stroke survivor ', ' high dimensionality ', ' stroke patient ', ' stroke model ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,423660,PA-18,0.18121355476818618
"Whole Transcriptome Studies of Patients with Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transient ischemic attacks (TIA) are critical to identify because prevention therapy can reduce the risk of future vascular events by > 50%. Diagnostic testing and therapeutic intervention must start as soon as possible because 10-25% of TIAs have a stroke within 90 days. Because so many patients present emergently with transient neurological events the large majority of whom do not go on to have a stroke, methods for identifying TIAs at high risk for stroke have been sought so that work up and treatment can be targeted to those who need it most to save time, money and limited resources. Though the ABCD2 score and brain Diffusion Weighted Imaging-MRI (DWI-MRI) have improved prediction of which TIAs have a stroke, their sensitivity and specificity for prediction of individual cases i poor. In this proposal we propose that peripheral blood leukocytes and platelets play pivotal roles in which TIAs go on to have a stroke and by assessing RNA in whole blood we can evaluate leukocyte and platelet function in TIA patients who go on to have stroke versus those that do not have a stroke. We hypothesize that specific coagulation and immune genes are activated in TIA patients that predispose them to have a stroke by 90 days compared to those TIA patients who do NOT have a stroke by 90 days. A subset of these leukocyte and platelet mRNA genes will predict TIAs who have a stroke by 90 days. This hypothesis is addressed by the following specific aims. Aim #1 (Derivation Cohort): Demonstrate that mRNA expression measured using RNAseq from whole blood differs in a derivation cohort of TIAs that go on to have a stroke by 90 days compared to those TIAs who do not have a stroke by 90 days. Demonstrate that most mRNA found to be regulated using RNAseq are also significantly regulated when measured using qRT-PCR. Aim #2 (Derivation Cohort): Apply machine learning algorithms to the mRNA from Aim #1 to derive an optimal subset of mRNA regulated by both RNAseq and qRT-PCR that predict which TIAs have strokes by 90 days compared to those who do not with >95% sensitivity on cross-validation. Aim #3 (Validation Cohort): Use machine/prediction learning algorithms to demonstrate that the genes from Aim #2 when measured using qRT-PCR on an independent validation cohort predict which TIAs have a stroke by 90 days with >85% sensitivity. The goal of these studies is to discover mRNA profiles in blood that predict which TIA patients go on to have strokes by 90 days. When confirmed in future studies, this will direct in depth testing to those high risk TIAs most in need in order to prevent strokes, and decrease unnecessary testing in those with low risk of stroke. Equally as important, the genes discovered to be associated with high risk of stroke in TIA patients will represent potential novel stroke prevention targets. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will examine RNA in blood using RNAseq and qRT-PCR of human subjects with Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs) who have a stroke by 90 days compared to TIAs who do not have a stroke. The regulated mRNA, exons and alternatively spliced transcripts in a Derivation Cohort of TIA patients will be used to predict which TIAs have a stroke by 90 days in a Validation Cohort of TIA patients.",Whole Transcriptome Studies of Patients with Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs),9896876,R01NS097000,"['Alternative Splicing ', ' Alternate Splicing ', ' Alternative RNA Splicing ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' atherosclerotic disease ', ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood Platelets ', ' Marrow platelet ', ' Platelets ', ' Thrombocytes ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Transient Ischemic Attack ', ' Brain TIA ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Exons ', ' Arterial Fatty Streak ', ' Arterial Fatty Streaks ', ' Atheroma ', ' Atheromatous ', ' Atheromatous degeneration ', ' Atheromatous plaque ', ' atherosclerosis plaque ', ' atherosclerotic lesions ', ' atherosclerotic plaque ', ' vulnerable plaque ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Labyrinthine disorder ', ' Labyrinth Diseases ', ' labyrinth disorder ', ' Leukocytes ', ' Blood leukocyte ', ' Leukocytes Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Marrow leukocyte ', ' White Blood Cells ', ' White Cell ', ' white blood cell ', ' white blood corpuscle ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Methods ', ' monocyte ', ' Blood monocyte ', ' Marrow monocyte ', ' neutrophil ', ' Blood Neutrophil ', ' Blood Polymorphonuclear Neutrophil ', ' Marrow Neutrophil ', ' Neutrophilic Granulocyte ', ' Neutrophilic Leukocyte ', ' Polymorphonuclear Cell ', ' Polymorphonuclear Leukocytes ', ' Polymorphonuclear Neutrophils ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Publishing ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' ROC Curve ', ' ROC Analyses ', ' receiver operating characteristic analyses ', ' receiver operating characteristic curve ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Measures ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' Migraine Headache ', ' Migraine ', ' base ', ' human subject ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' peripheral blood ', ' Individual ', ' cerebral ', ' Cerebrum ', ' Whole Blood ', ' Hour ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Event ', ' cohort ', ' release factor ', ' novel ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Ischemic Stroke ', ' DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) ', ' DWI-MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion weighted imaging ', ' Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' dMRI ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' prevent stroke ', ' Stroke prevention ', ' Clotting ', ' Coagulation ', ' Coagulation Process ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Quantitative RTPCR ', ' qRTPCR ', ' Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR ', ' mRNA Expression ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' Transcript ', ' Validation ', ' Derivation ', ' Derivation procedure ', ' Prevention therapy ', ' prospective ', ' discover genes ', ' gene discovery ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' transcriptome ', ' emergency settings ', ' risk for stroke ', ' risk of stroke ', ' stroke risk ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' platelet function ', ' learning algorithm ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2020,544777,CA-03,0.27762883267128713
"Toward a Mechanistic Understanding of Optimization Principles Underlying Hemiparetic Gait This project seeks to identify how motor impairments in stroke survivors contribute to mobility deficits through the use of behavioral observations and computational models. Ultimately, this knowledge could be used to design more effective interventions to improve walking ability, increase functional independence, and reduce fall risk in individuals post-stroke. After a stroke, walking ability is affected by motor control deficits which are often characterized by hemiparesis, or weakness on one side of the body. During walking, hemiparesis is often associated with a visible limp that is due to differences in step lengths and stance times between the right and left sides of the body. Reducing these right-left asymmetries are a common objective of rehabilitation, and recently researchers have developed a number of approaches designed to reduce asymmetries such as acoustic pacing, unilateral step training, and split-belt treadmill training. Despite the recent clinical focus on reducing asymmetry, the potential functional benefits of improving symmetry have yet to be established. This research will address this gap by answering two fundamental questions: 1) Do improvements in symmetry lead to functional benefits such as a more efficient walking pattern or improvements in balance? 2) If stroke survivors retain the capacity to walk more symmetrically why do they choose to do otherwise? Although improvements in symmetry can no doubt reduce the potential stigma of walking with a limp, it is possible that a symmetric walking pattern could be less efficient or put patients at a higher risk of falls if it requires that they push the limits of their capacity. Alternatively, it is possible that, through repeated stepping practice, post- stroke individuals have reinforced a suboptimal pattern due to insufficient experience with a more optimal, symmetric pattern. Addressing these issues requires a thorough understanding of the processes by which stroke survivors optimize their walking pattern. Here, these issues are addressed using behavioral approaches to quantify tradeoffs between asymmetry and measures of walking ability such as stability and economy, and computational methods to identify the causal relationships linking these variables. Ultimately, the knowledge derived from this work will provide a mechanistic understanding of how the damaged brain optimizes movement, and may also inform the way in which clinicians develop personalized rehabilitation objectives for stroke survivors. Our findings may also inform cost/benefit analyses of walking in other patient populations known to have asymmetric walking patterns such as amputees or individuals with Parkinson's disease. Furthermore, providing a more mechanistic rationale for gait rehabilitation interventions could improve the efficiency of physical therapy, reduce health care costs, and ultimately help to better reintegrate individuals with neuromotor impairments into society by maximizing their mobility. Public Health Relevance Statement This project seeks to identify the how walking impairments in stroke survivors contribute to mobility deficits through the use of behavioral observations and computational models. The chosen approach integrates biomechanical analyses, physiological assessments and machine learning algorithms to explain how asymmetries during walking influence balance and the effort required to walk. Ultimately, the results of this work may lead to more personalized rehabilitation strategies to improve walking capacity and efficiency, and ultimately reduce fall risk in stroke survivors.",Toward a Mechanistic Understanding of Optimization Principles Underlying Hemiparetic Gait,9939297,R01HD091184,"['Acceleration ', ' Acoustics ', ' Acoustic ', ' Affect ', ' Amputees ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Biomechanics ', ' biomechanical ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Cost-Benefit Analysis ', ' cost benefit economics ', ' cost benefit effectiveness ', ' Environment ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Limb structure ', ' Extremities ', ' Limbs ', ' Non-Trunk ', ' foot ', ' Gait ', ' Gases ', ' Goals ', ' hemiparesis ', ' hemiparetic ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Nervous system structure ', ' Nervous System ', ' Neurologic Body System ', ' Neurologic Organ System ', ' Paresis ', ' Muscle Paresis ', ' Muscular Paresis ', ' paretic ', ' paretic muscle ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Parkinson ', "" Parkinson's disease "", ' Parkinsons disease ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Patients ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' rehab therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' rehabilitative therapy ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Societies ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Walking ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' improved ', ' rehabilitation after stroke ', ' stroke rehab ', ' stroke rehabilitation ', ' Left ', ' Clinical ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Acquired brain injury ', ' brain damage ', ' brain-injured ', ' Brain Injuries ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Metabolic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Side ', ' Reaction ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' behavioral observation ', ' behavior observation ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' visual feedback ', ' computer science ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Speed ', ' Participant ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Physiatric Procedure ', ' Physical Medicine Procedure ', ' Physical Therapeutics ', ' Physiotherapy ', ' Physical therapy ', ' fall risk ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Exercise Physiology ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' after stroke ', ' poststroke ', ' post stroke ', ' cost ', ' injured ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' Step retraining ', ' Step training ', ' Individual Differences ', ' Impairment ', ' rehab strategy ', ' rehabilitation strategy ', ' movement impairment ', ' movement limitation ', ' motor impairment ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' motor control ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' patient population ', ' clinical practice ', ' treadmill training ', ' locomotor control ', ' gait recovery ', ' gait rehab ', ' gait retraining ', ' gait training ', ' gait rehabilitation ', ' treadmill ', ' walking pace ', ' walking speed ', ' stroke survivor ', ' functional independence ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' Computer Models ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2020,380769,CA-37,0.1854457409517399
"A Machine Learning Approach For CTA-based Plaque Characterization and Stroke Risk Prediction in Carotid Artery Atherosclerosis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Carotid artery atherosclerosis is a major vascular risk factor and accounts for approximately 15% of all strokes. A major risk marker in patients with carotid atherosclerosis has been the degree of narrowing, or stenosis, of the carotid artery lumen. While stenosis is often quantified via angiography, imaging can also provide detailed assessments of plaque. Our project is motivated by converging data that correlate vulnerable plaque elements, which can be captured with imaging, with increased stroke risk. Identifying high-risk or vulnerable carotid plaques before a stroke occurs is important because stroke prevention treatments, like carotid endarterectomy or stenting, carry risks and ideally should only be performed only those patients at highest risk of stroke. CTA (computed tomographic angiography) is an attractive tool for plaque imaging since it is not operator dependent, can be quickly performed, and is more widely available than MRI. Although CTA offers significant potential to evaluate these plaque features, small studies have not reached a consensus regarding their reliability and clinical relevance. In this project, we plan to explore the utility of CTA for the detailed carotid vessel wall imaging by employing a unique, large-scale clinical dataset and advanced algorithms. Our overarching objective in this R21 project is to conduct developmental and interdisciplinary research that will lay the foundation for the implementation and validation of novel CTA-based technologies that can be adopted in the risk stratification of patients with carotid atherosclerosis. Our central hypothesis is that there are CTA-based carotid plaque features that can be reliably extracted and used for stroke risk stratification, which will be more sensitive and specific than standard stenosis grading. To pursue our objective, we will pursue two specific aims: In Specific Aim 1 we plan to optimize the use of human reader defined plaque features in predicting culprit carotid plaques. We will perform a blinded, multi-reader study of CTA-derived carotid plaque features in a large scale clinical dataset to test the association between CTA-derived human-defined features and stroke, and compute accuracy metrics. In Specific Aim 2, we plan to develop algorithms to automatically characterize and discriminate culprit carotid plaque in CTA. We will implement and test image processing algorithms that automatically compute from a CTA scan stroke-associated carotid artery plaque features (from Aim 1), and then train a machine learning algorithm to distinguish culprit from asymptomatic carotid artery plaques. We believe that this R21 study is significant because it will establish a novel, machine learning-aided imaging strategy which can aid in identifying high-risk carotid artery plaques before they cause stroke and when they can be properly treated to prevent stroke from occurring in the future. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed research is relevant to public health because the discovery of novel and treatable vascular risk factors will ultimately improve risk factor screening and stroke prevention efforts, thereby reducing the incidence of a disabling and lethal disease. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of the NHLBI's mission that involves reducing the burden of vascular disease by fostering research on prevention.",A Machine Learning Approach For

"Enhancing Stroke Prehospital and Emergency Evaluation and Delivery (E-SPEED) Nearly 800,000 people in the United States (US) each year are affected by stroke, which remains the leading cause of adult disability and 5th leading cause of death. Despite the proliferation of stroke centers nationwide, access to timely stroke care and evidence-based therapies is still poor with multiple inefficiencies, redundancies, errors, and system-based barriers that lead to care fragmentation. A stroke system of care that integrates and coordinates care between non-stroke center hospitals, primary stroke centers, and comprehensive stroke centers has been recommended since it would reduce stroke-related deaths by 20,000 annually in the US and nearly 400,000 worldwide. This proposal is significant because it addresses two important gaps in knowledge about the acute evaluation and treatment of stroke patients: prehospital screening errors and delays in inter-hospital transfer. The Enhancing Stroke Prehospital and Emergency Evaluation and Delivery (E-SPEED) study will (1) enhance existing LVO screening tools, assess whether machine learning approaches improve LVO prediction, and evaluate the impact of an Enhanced LVO Screening Tool in the prehospital setting; and (2) use learning collaboratives and simulations to design, implement, and pilot test a new inter-hospital stroke transfer protocol. We bring together systems engineers and stroke health service researchers in a novel collaboration that will produce generalizable knowledge that can be widely applied to other urban regions of the country and provide preliminary data and demonstration of novel approaches that could be evaluated in large-scale comparative effectiveness studies across multiple regions.

"Optimizing stroke prevention for older adults with atrial fibrillation: Towards rigorous evaluation and judicious application of a new device PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Atrial fibrillation (AF) affects about 10% of older adults and accounts for a growing proportion of strokes. Lifelong oral anticoagulation, with warfarin or a non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant (NOAC), is recommended for stroke prevention in most AF patients. However, the drugs increase the risk of bleeding and the adherence to the lifelong drug therapy is poor, leaving many patients under-treated. The recently-approved Watchman device offers an attractive alternative to lifelong drug therapy for AF stroke prevention. However, the device has been studied in only two clinical trials, both of which compared it to warfarin. Little is known about how Watchman compares with the current mainstay therapy, NOACs, or how Watchman compares with no treatment in patients who have difficulties taking anticoagulation drugs. Furthermore, for preventive treatment with a high upfront cost and some procedural risks, a personalized approach is needed to target Watchman to patients who are most likely to benefit and avoid it in those who have little to gain. Therefore, the overall objective of this project is to address these evidence gaps and develop new prediction tools to optimize the use of Watchman for AF stroke prevention. In Aim 1, we will conduct comparative effectiveness studies using a large national administrative database (OptumLabs) that contains insurance claims for over two million patients with AF of all ages and races from all 50 states with linked EHRs in a subset. The findings will provide timely evidence to address the key unanswered questions highlighted in current practice guidelines and will facilitate the design, analysis, and interpretation of future clinical trials. In Aim 2, we will develop and validate machine-learning models to predict how Watchman compares with non-invasive therapies. We will develop the models using the OptumLabs data, and validate the models in two RCTs and two large health systems’ EHRs, thereby validating models in both clinical trial and routine practice settings. The new prediction models will provide personalized estimates for the benefits and harms, and thus, engage patients in making informed choices consistent with their preferences and ease clinicians’ cognitive burden. In Aim 3, we will assess how the Watchman decisions made in contemporary practice agree with those suggested by the new prediction models. We will use machine-learning methods to identify patient and provider characteristics associated with incongruent decisions. Such findings will highlight patient and provider groups who may particularly benefit from the decision support, thereby informing future implementation and translation efforts. We have assembled a team with complementary clinical and research expertise, a solid record of successful collaboration, and extensive experience in outcomes research and prediction modeling. We also have developed a web-based decision aid that is ready to translate the prediction models to reduce unwarranted variation in care delivery, patient outcomes, and medical costs. PROJECT NARRATIVE The findings will provide timely evidence to bridge the gaps between clinical trials and everyday practice. The new prediction models, once embedded in a decision aid, will bring personalized outcome estimates to shared decision making to promote evidence-based and patient-centered care. Therefore, the proposed project has great potentials to improve the care for millions of patients with AF at risk for stroke.",Optimizing stroke prevention for older adults with atrial fibrillation: Towards rigorous evaluation and judicious application of a new device,9882377,R01AG062436,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Anticoagulants ', ' Anticoagulant Agents ', ' Anticoagulant Drugs ', ' blood thinner ', ' thrombopoiesis inhibitor ', ' Anticoagulation ', ' Atrial Fibrillation ', ' Auricular Fibrillation ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Data Sources ', ' Decision Making ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Future ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Bleeding ', ' blood loss ', ' Judgment ', ' Online Systems ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' online computer ', ' web based ', ' Patients ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Risk ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Suggestion ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Warfarin ', ' Decision Aid ', ' medical costs ', ' Medical Care Costs ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' Caring ', ' Practice Guidelines ', ' improved ', ' Solid ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Patient-Centered Care ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Oral ', ' Clinic ', ' Risk-Benefit Assessment ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' care delivery ', ' Devices ', ' Modeling ', ' Provider ', ' prevent stroke ', ' Stroke prevention ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' Characteristics ', ' cost ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' administrative data base ', ' administrative database ', ' evidence base ', ' routine practice ', ' shared decision making ', ' BigData ', ' Big Data ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized medicine ', ' cognitive burden ', ' cognitive load ', ' Personalized medical approach ', ' individualized approach ', ' precision approach ', ' tailored approach ', ' personalized approach ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' outcome prediction ', ' Preventative treatment ', ' Preventive treatment ', ' insurance claims ', ' practice setting ', ' preservation ', ' risk for stroke ', ' risk of stroke ', ' stroke risk ', ' death risk ', ' mortality risk ', ' comparative effectiveness study ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NIA,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2020,475350,MN-01,0.14309792479913006
"Big Data Neuroimaging to Predict Motor Behavior After Stroke PROJECT SUMMARY  Stroke is a leading cause of serious long-term adult disability around the world. Despite intensive therapy, an estimated 2/3 of stroke survivors do not fully recover and are left unable to care for themselves independently. Growing research suggests that rehabilitation is not “one-size-fits-all”; variability among stroke survivors in terms of lesion location, age, gender, time since stroke and more may all affect a person's likelihood of recovery and response to different types of treatments. Personalized rehabilitation medicine to maximize each individual's recovery potential is thus desperately needed. However, in order to develop accurate, robust, and specific predictive models that can determine an individual's recovery potential and response to different treatments, large, heterogeneous datasets are needed. The current best predictors of stroke outcomes are neuroimaging (MRI) and behavioral biomarkers that look at brain structure/function and motor performance at baseline. Generating a large enough dataset of MRI and behavioral data is extremely difficult and expensive for any one site to do on its own. This proposal addresses this problem by generating a large, diverse dataset using a novel meta-analytic approach that harmonizes post-stroke data collected worldwide. In partnership with an international consortium comprised of over 500 researchers who produce the largest-known neuroimaging and genetic studies of over 18 different diseases (ENIGMA Center for Worldwide Medicine, Imaging, and Genomics), I propose to apply ENIGMA's powerful approach to answer critical questions in stroke recovery. Under this K01 career development award, I will develop skills in big data neuroimaging analytics, clinical research, and consortium building through my ENIGMA Stroke Recovery working group in order to ask questions about stroke recovery using a large dataset approach (goal n>3,000). This project has four specific aims: Aim 1 will leverage ENIGMA's existing methodology to develop the infrastructure, optimal methods, and analysis techniques for harmonizing a large dataset of post-stroke MRI and behavioral data. Aim 2 will use this large dataset to identify neural and behavioral biomarkers predicting recovery of motor impairment (e.g., actual arm movement ability) and recovery of function (e.g., ability to perform tasks, such as picking up objects with the affected arm). Aim 3 will use supervised machine learning to generate and fine-tune highly accurate predictive models of the relationship between these biomarkers and recovery of impairment versus function. Lastly, Aim 4 will use unsupervised machine learning techniques to examine shared properties of outliers from the predictive model and determine additional neurobiological mechanisms that may prevent individuals from recovering. This approach has the potential to revolutionize the way that rehabilitation research is validated, to ensure robust, reliable, and reproducible results. The methods developed here could be extended to other domains of recovery (language, gait), to study other predictors of recovery (functional brain activity, genomics), and to other clinical populations to improve rehabilitation overall. PROJECT NARRATIVE The overall goal of this project is to provide personalized, precise rehabilitation medicine to individuals after stroke by developing accurate predictive models that help us detect who will recover and best respond to different types of post-stroke treatments. Using a novel meta-analytic approach, this project will harmonize datasets of brain imaging and behavioral information across sites worldwide in order to develop a large dataset with thousands of participants. Advanced statistical and machine learning techniques will then be applied to this dataset in order to detect robust neural and behavioral biomarkers that can be used to predict stroke recovery and to personalize treatments across diverse populations.",Big Data Neuroimaging to Predict Motor Behavior After Stroke,9888377,K01HD091283,"['Activities of Daily Living ', ' Activities of everyday life ', '
