"Targeted Empirical Super Learning in HIV Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aim of this project is to study and extend a general statistical methodology, called Targeted Empirical Learning, which includes a recently developed Targeted Maximum Likelihood methodology. The fundamental theoretical underpinnings of this new and unified approach to statistical learning have been developed and we propose to expand Targeted Empirical Learning into a practical product that can be applied to pressing scientific questions. Building on long-standing collaborations with leading scientists in the areas of clinical AIDS research, we will use this novel methodology to address research questions concerning HIV. Given observed data consisting of a realization of n independently and identically distributed random variables, Targeted Empirical Learning employs the following elements: i) defining the parameter of interest; 2) modeling the parameter of interest, leaving the nuisance parameters unspecified or only including truly known modeling assumptions; 3) developing targeted robust and highly efficient (maximum likelihood) estimators of the parameter of interest. The methodology relies on unified cross- validation to choose between competitive estimators indexed by, for example, choices of sieves parameterizations, algorithms, and/or dimension reductions (in particular for the nuisance parameters). Importantly, the cross-validation criterion employed evaluates the performance of these candidate estimators with respect to the parameter of interest. Specific applications to be addressed include the following: i) develop models and corresponding targeted empirical learners of optimal individualized treatment rules for treating HIV-infected patients, 2) estimate measures of variable importance/causal effects for mutations in the HIV virus for predicting clinical response to drug combinations; 3) estimate causal effects of adherence profiles on virologic suppression for HIV-infected patients. We will further develop and apply a novel resampling-based multiple testing methodology to properly address our simultaneous testing and estimation of many scientific parameters of interest.           ",Targeted Empirical Super Learning in HIV Research,7883449,R01AI074345,"['Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Observational Study ', ' Validation ', ' Immunologics ', ' Immunochemical Immunologic ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Future ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Affect ', ' Genotype ', ' base ', ' density ', ' Hand ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' seropositive (AIDS test) ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' Algorithms ', ' Left ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' In Vitro ', ' indexing ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Disease Progression ', ' CD4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' T4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' CD4+ Counts ', ' CD4+ Cell Counts ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Collaborations ', ' Nucleosides ', ' Patients ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Plasma ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Protease Inhibitor ', ' Proteinase Inhibitors ', ' Protease Antagonists ', ' Peptide Peptidohydrolase Inhibitors ', ' Peptide Hydrolase Inhibitors ', ' Peptidase Inhibitors ', ' Endopeptidase Inhibitors ', ' Antiproteases ', ' tool ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' RNA ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Computer software ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' programs ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Burden ', ' CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes ', ' helper T cell ', ' T4 Lymphocytes ', ' T4 Cells ', ' CD4-Positive Lymphocytes ', ' CD4+ T-Lymphocyte ', ' CD4+ T cell ', ' CD4 lymphocyte ', ' CD4 T cells ', ' CD4 Cells ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Testing ', ' Scientist ', ' Time ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Writing ', ' Dimensions ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Viral ', ' interest ', ' Performance ', ' user friendly software ', ' user friendly computer software ', ' Anti-Retroviral Agents ', ' antiretroviral ', ' anti-retroviral ', ' Antiretroviral Agents ', ' novel ', ' Categories ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Cell Count ', ' Cell Number ', ' Measures ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Mediating ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Documentation ', ' Communities ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' Outcome ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' treatment effect ', ' user-friendly ', ' open source ', ' Regimen ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Drug Combinations ', ' Drug resistance ', ' resistant to Drug ', ' resistance to Drug ', ' drug resistant ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Elements ', ' Address ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' ']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2010,473194,CA-13,0.08071187263906658
"Prostate-cancer Imaging by Combined Ultrasound and Magnetic-resonance Parameters    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Riverside Research Institute, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Rutgers University, and the General Electric Corporation propose to undertake an Academic-Industrial Partnership study to improve prostate- cancer (PCA) imaging markedly and thereby improve prostate-biopsy guidance to detect PCa; enhance monitoring, surveillance, and treatment of PCa; and enable planning and execution of focal PCa therapy. The project is highly significant because it addresses a major health problem in the United States and other developed countries. The project will overcome the current inability of established clinical-imaging method to image PCa reliably by combining the capabilities of advanced ultrasound (US) and magnetic-resonance (MR) techniques in a clinically effective manner. The proposed approach will exploit the sensitivity of US to mechanical properties of tissue on a microscopic scale with the sensitivity of MR to chemical constituents of tissue and its ability to sense blood distribution. Each of these modalities senses different and independent properties of tissue and has shown encouraging potential for improved imaging of PCa when used alone; combining parameters derived from each modality can provide far superior sensitivity and specificity for PCa. We will combine US and MR parameters using advanced classifiers such as artificial neural networks and support-vector machines. These classifiers already have produced ROC-curve areas of 0.91 for advanced US methods, and the MR methods have demonstrated equivalent ROC-curve areas in many studies. We will embody the combined capabilities in specifications for a prototype imaging system that can generate prostate tissue-typing images (TTIs) in real-time for targeting biopsies or planning treatment in the operating room or in an off-line setting. The latest Logiq E9 instrument currently being produced by GE already has a capability for fusing previously obtained MR images with US images in real time, which provides an existing framework for combining US and MR parameters and generating real-time TTIs. Successfully generating reliable prostate TTIs based on combined US and MR parameters will represent a quantum advance in PCa management by enabling significant improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of PCa.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Riverside Research Institute, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Rutgers University, and the General Electric Corporation propose to undertake an Academic-Industrial Partnership study to improve prostate- cancer (PCA) imaging markedly and thereby improve prostate-biopsy guidance; enhance monitoring, surveillance, and treatment of PCa; and enable planning and execution of focal PCa therapy.

"Multi-Modality Quantitiative Imaging for Evaluation of Response to Cancer Therapy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancers are heterogeneous in biology among patients, tumors in the same patient, and within tumors. As a result, they respond differently to therapy per patient, per tumor and within tumors. Different radiotracers and imaging modalities provide information about different aspects of biology and the physio-metabolic environments of the cancer. As a result, a single modality or radiotracer may not provide sufficient information to predict or assess response to therapy. We hypothesize that improved prediction and assessment of response can thus be obtained by combining quantitative image-derived parameters obtained from multiple imaging modalities or radiotracers. We propose to develop, optimize, and validate approaches for combining multiple image-derived parameters obtained from quantitative imaging procedures in order to optimally predict and assess treatment response. In particular, we propose to combine quantitative metrics from PET/CT, SPECT/CT, and MRI. We will first individually optimize the protocols, acquisition parameters, and imaging methods in order to get the most accurate and reliable parameters to combine. Optimally combining the parameters from different modalities requires knowledge of the reproducibility (precision) of the individual quantitative imaging parameters. We will thus use literature search, phantom studies, realistic simulations, and repeated patient studies to characterize the accuracy and precision of the individual quantitative imaging methods.

"Multi-Modality Quantitiative Imaging for Evaluation of Response to Cancer Therapy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancers are heterogeneous in biology among patients, tumors in the same patient, and within tumors. As a result, they respond differently to therapy per patient, per tumor and within tumors. Different radiotracers and imaging modalities provide information about different aspects of biology and the physio-metabolic environments of the cancer. As a result, a single modality or radiotracer may not provide sufficient information to predict or assess response to therapy. We hypothesize that improved prediction and assessment of response can thus be obtained by combining quantitative image-derived parameters obtained from multiple imaging modalities or radiotracers. We propose to develop, optimize, and validate approaches for combining multiple image-derived parameters obtained from quantitative imaging procedures in order to optimally predict and assess treatment response. In particular, we propose to combine quantitative metrics from PET/CT, SPECT/CT, and MRI. We will first individually optimize the protocols, acquisition parameters, and imaging methods in order to get the most accurate and reliable parameters to combine. Optimally combining the parameters from different modalities requires knowledge of the reproducibility (precision) of the individual quantitative imaging parameters.

"3D Image Analysis Approach to Determine Severity and Cause of Optic Nerve Edema     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Currently, the clinical assessment of optic nerve swelling is limited by the subjective ophthalmoscopic evaluation by experts in order to diagnose and differentiate the cause of the optic disc edema. The long-term goal of our research effort is to develop automated 3D image-analysis approaches for the identification of an optimal set of 3D parameters to quantify the severity of optic nerve edema over time and to help differentiate the underlying cause. The overall objective in this application is to develop strategies, using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), to rapidly and accurately determine the severity of optic nerve swelling in patients diagnosed with papilledema and to ascertain morphological features that differentiate papilledema from other disorders causing optic nerve edema. The central hypothesis is that information about volumetric and shape parameters obtainable from 3D image analysis techniques will improve the ability to accurately assess the severity and cause of optic disc edema over the existing subjective ophthalmoscopic assessment of optic nerve swelling using the Fris¿n scale or current 2D OCT parameters. The rationale for the proposed research is that having such 3D parameters will dramatically improve the way optic disc swelling is assessed. The following specific aims will be pursued: 1. Develop and evaluate the methodology for computing novel volumetric and shape parameters of a swollen optic nerve head from SD-OCT. This will be completed by refining and evaluating our novel 3D graph-based segmentation algorithms in SD-OCT volumes of patients with optic disc swelling. 2. Identify SD-OCT parameters that optimally correlate with clinical measurements of severity in patients with papilledema and develop a continuous severity scale. This will be accomplished by using machine-learning approaches to relate SD-OCT parameters to expert-defined Fris¿n scale grades (a fundus-based measure of severity). It is anticipated that volumetric 3D parameters will more closely correlate with clinical measures than 2D parameters and will provide a continuous severity scale. 3. Identify SD-OCT parameters that differentiate papilledema from other causes of optic disc swelling (or apparent optic disc swelling, as in pseudopapilledema) and develop a corresponding predictive classifier. Our working hypothesis is that 3D shape parameters, especially those near Bruch's membrane opening, will contribute the most in the automatic differentiation process. The approach is innovative because the 3D image-analysis methodology developed by the applicants enables novel determination of 3D volumetric and shape parameters and represents a significant improvement over the status quo of using qualitative image information and 2D OCT image information for assessing optic disc swelling. The proposed research is significant because it will help to establish a much-needed alternative and more objective method by which to assess the severity and cause of optic disc swelling.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because the identification of novel spectral-domain optical coherence tomography parameters for assessing the severity and cause of optic nerve edema is expected to enable more efficient and effective diagnosis and management strategies of patients with such swelling. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge to reduce the burdens of disability and is particularly relevant to the part of NEI's mission regarding understanding blinding eye diseases and preserving sight.                ",3D Image Analysis Approach to Determine Severity and Cause of Optic Nerve Edema,8477880,R01EY023279,"['Algorithms ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Hydrops ', ' Dropsy ', ' Edema ', ' ophthalmopathy ', ' eye disorder ', ' Eye diseases ', ' Goals ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Mission ', ' Nerve Fibers ', ' Optic Papilla ', ' Optic Nerve Head ', ' Optic Disk ', ' Second Cranial Nerve ', ' Cranial Nerve II ', ' Optic Nerve ', ' second cranial nerve disorder ', ' Second Cranial Nerve Diseases ', ' Optic Neuropathy ', ' Optic Nerve Diseases ', ' Neural-Optical Lesion ', ' Cranial Nerve II Disorder ', ' Cranial Nerve II Diseases ', ' optic nerve disorder ', ' Optic Papilla Edema ', ' Optic Disk Edema ', ' Choked Disk ', ' Papilledema ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Swelling ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' Work ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Measures ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Lamina Basalis Choroideae ', ' Bruchs membrane ', "" Bruch's membrane "", ' Bruch Membrane ', "" Bruch's basal membrane structure "", ' Intracranial Pressure Increase ', ' Intracranial Pressure Elevation ', ' Elevated Intracranial Pressure ', ' Intracranial Hypertension ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Measurement ', ' Staging ', ' Shapes ', ' instrument ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Diagnostic Technique ', ' Diagnostic Method ', ' Diagnostic Procedure ', ' Dimensions ', ' Severities ', ' Techniques ', ' visual loss ', ' vision loss ', ' Blindness ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Structure ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' Graph ', ' Modality ', ' Fundus ', ' OCT Tomography ', ' Doppler OCT ', ' Optical Coherence Tomography ', ' 3D images ', ' 3D image ', ' 3-D image ', ' 3-D Images ', ' Three-Dimensional Image ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' cost ', ' digital ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' disability burden ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2013,339750,IA-02,0.24549539992951844

"Prostate-cancer Imaging by Combined Ultrasound and Magnetic-resonance Parameters    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Riverside Research Institute, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Rutgers University, and the General Electric Corporation propose to undertake an Academic-Industrial Partnership study to improve prostate- cancer (PCA) imaging markedly and thereby improve prostate-biopsy guidance to detect PCa; enhance monitoring, surveillance, and treatment of PCa; and enable planning and execution of focal PCa therapy. The project is highly significant because it addresses a major health problem in the United States and other developed countries. The project will overcome the current inability of established clinical-imaging method to image PCa reliably by combining the capabilities of advanced ultrasound (US) and magnetic-resonance (MR) techniques in a clinically effective manner. The proposed approach will exploit the sensitivity of US to mechanical properties of tissue on a microscopic scale with the sensitivity of MR to chemical constituents of tissue and its ability to sense blood distribution. Each of these modalities senses different and independent properties of tissue and has shown encouraging potential for improved imaging of PCa when used alone; combining parameters derived from each modality can provide far superior sensitivity and specificity for PCa. We will combine US and MR parameters using advanced classifiers such as artificial neural networks and support-vector machines. These classifiers already have produced ROC-curve areas of 0.91 for advanced US methods, and the MR methods have demonstrated equivalent ROC-curve areas in many studies. We will embody the combined capabilities in specifications for a prototype imaging system that can generate prostate tissue-typing images (TTIs) in real-time for targeting biopsies or planning treatment in the operating room or in an off-line setting. The latest Logiq E9 instrument currently being produced by GE already has a capability for fusing previously obtained MR images with US images in real time, which provides an existing framework for combining US and MR parameters and generating real-time TTIs. Successfully generating reliable prostate TTIs based on combined US and MR parameters will represent a quantum advance in PCa management by enabling significant improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of PCa.

The project will combine attributes of advanced ultrasound and magnetic-resonance techniques and embody them in a prototype imaging system capable of generating novel tissue-type images that reliably depict PCa in real-time.

"3D Image Analysis Approach to Determine Severity and Cause of Optic Nerve Edema     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Currently, the clinical assessment of optic nerve swelling is limited by the subjective ophthalmoscopic evaluation by experts in order to diagnose and differentiate the cause of the optic disc edema. The long-term goal of our research effort is to develop automated 3D image-analysis approaches for the identification of an optimal set of 3D parameters to quantify the severity of optic nerve edema over time and to help differentiate the underlying cause. The overall objective in this application is to develop strategies, using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), to rapidly and accurately determine the severity of optic nerve swelling in patients diagnosed with papilledema and to ascertain morphological features that differentiate papilledema from other disorders causing optic nerve edema. The central hypothesis is that information about volumetric and shape parameters obtainable from 3D image analysis techniques will improve the ability to accurately assess the severity and cause of optic disc edema over the existing subjective ophthalmoscopic assessment of optic nerve swelling using the Fris¿n scale or current 2D OCT parameters. The rationale for the proposed research is that having such 3D parameters will dramatically improve the way optic disc swelling is assessed. The following specific aims will be pursued: 1. Develop and evaluate the methodology for computing novel volumetric and shape parameters of a swollen optic nerve head from SD-OCT. This will be completed by refining and evaluating our novel 3D graph-based segmentation algorithms in SD-OCT volumes of patients with optic disc swelling. 2. Identify SD-OCT parameters that optimally correlate with clinical measurements of severity in patients with papilledema and develop a continuous severity scale. This will be accomplished by using machine-learning approaches to relate SD-OCT parameters to expert-defined Fris¿n scale grades (a fundus-based measure of severity). It is anticipated that volumetric 3D parameters will more closely correlate with clinical measures than 2D parameters and will provide a continuous severity scale. 3. Identify SD-OCT parameters that differentiate papilledema from other causes of optic disc swelling (or apparent optic disc swelling, as in pseudopapilledema) and develop a corresponding predictive classifier. Our working hypothesis is that 3D shape parameters, especially those near Bruch's membrane opening, will contribute the most in the automatic differentiation process. The approach is innovative because the 3D image-analysis methodology developed by the applicants enables novel determination of 3D volumetric and shape parameters and represents a significant improvement over the status quo of using qualitative image information and 2D OCT image information for assessing optic disc swelling. The proposed research is significant because it will help to establish a much-needed alternative and more objective method by which to assess the severity and cause of optic disc swelling.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because the identification of novel spectral-domain optical coherence tomography parameters for assessing the severity and cause of optic nerve edema is expected to enable more efficient and effective diagnosis and management strategies of patients with such swelling. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge to reduce the burdens of disability and is particularly relevant to the part of NEI's mission regarding understanding blinding eye diseases and preserving sight.                ",3D Image Analysis Approach to Determine Severity and Cause of Optic Nerve Edema,8652462,R01EY023279,"['Algorithms ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Hydrops ', ' Dropsy ', ' Edema ', ' ophthalmopathy ', ' eye disorder ', ' Eye diseases ', ' Goals ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Mission ', ' Nerve Fibers ', ' Optic Papilla ', ' Optic Nerve Head ', ' Optic Disk ', ' Second Cranial Nerve ', ' Cranial Nerve II ', ' Optic Nerve ', ' second cranial nerve disorder ', ' Second Cranial Nerve Diseases ', ' Optic Neuropathy ', ' Optic Nerve Diseases ', ' Neural-Optical Lesion ', ' Cranial Nerve II Disorder ', ' Cranial Nerve II Diseases ', ' optic nerve disorder ', ' Optic Papilla Edema ', ' Optic Disk Edema ', ' Choked Disk ', ' Papilledema ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Swelling ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' Work ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Measures ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Lamina Basalis Choroideae ', ' Bruchs membrane ', "" Bruch's membrane "", ' Bruch Membrane ', "" Bruch's basal membrane structure "", ' Intracranial Pressure Increase ', ' Intracranial Pressure Elevation ', ' Elevated Intracranial Pressure ', ' Intracranial Hypertension ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Measurement ', ' Staging ', ' Shapes ', ' instrument ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Diagnostic Technique ', ' Diagnostic Method ', ' Diagnostic Procedure ', ' Dimensions ', ' Severities ', ' Techniques ', ' visual loss ', ' vision loss ', ' Blindness ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Structure ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' Graph ', ' Modality ', ' Fundus ', ' OCT Tomography ', ' Doppler OCT ', ' Optical Coherence Tomography ', ' 3D images ', ' 3D image ', ' 3-D image ', ' 3-D Images ', ' Three-Dimensional Image ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' cost ', ' digital ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' disability burden ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2014,332955,IA-02,0.24549539992951844
"SCH: Proactive Health Monitoring Using Individualized Analysis of Tissue Elastic* DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Existing studies suggest that tissue elasticity is possibly correlated with the aggressiveness of cancers. Based on results from deformable image registration, the proposed project investigates the possibility of tracking the organs movement subject to external forces and geometric constraints, thereby deducing patient-specific tissue elasticity parameters for proactive health monitoring. The objectives of this exploratory research project are (1) to develop a computational framework based on extensive studies of a large cohort of cancer patients, in order to accurately estimate patent-specific tissu elasticity using a coupled biomechanical simulation-optimization framework on a pair of medical images (possibly from ultrasound, mammography, computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance imaging, or other imaging technologies); (2) to examine potential association between tissue elasticity in different regions with aggressiveness of know/diagnosed cancer in the corresponding regions; (3) to derive predictive models for cancer staging/grading based on recovered patient-specific tissue elasticity and other explanatory variables; (4) to design a health monitoring system based on individualized analysis of tissue elasticity for 'at-risk' groups  who are more likely to develop cancers. This proposal describes a truly ambitious effort and a bold vision that is built upon the investigators' prior scientific accomplishments and strong credentials to potentially transform existing practice to more proactive, preventive, evidence-based health monitoring for individuals at risk of developing cancers. This research is expected to make several major scientific advances. These include new algorithms for non-invasive, image-based techniques for automatic extraction of tissue elasticity parameters without force applications and/or force sensing devices, novel regression models and inference procedures for survival analysis, new force sensing devices, novel regression models and inference procedures for survival analysis, new predictive models for cancer staging and grading based on patient-specific tissue elasticity parameters, and a health monitoring system for at-risk groups based on individual tissue elasticity along with other variables. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Other than health monitoring, the patient-specific tissue parameters can be incorporated into medical simulators to perform patient-specific surgical planning, compute desired force-feedback for tele-surgery, design and prototype medical devices, and conduct virtual surgical training. The statistical inference techniques developed can be applicable to genetic epidemiology, health economics, and bioinformatics.",SCH: Proactive Health Monitoring Using Individualized Analysis of

"Multi-Modality Quantitiative Imaging for Evaluation of Response to Cancer Therapy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancers are heterogeneous in biology among patients, tumors in the same patient, and within tumors. As a result, they respond differently to therapy per patient, per tumor and within tumors. Different radiotracers and imaging modalities provide information about different aspects of biology and the physio-metabolic environments of the cancer. As a result, a single modality or radiotracer may not provide sufficient information to predict or assess response to therapy. We hypothesize that improved prediction and assessment of response can thus be obtained by combining quantitative image-derived parameters obtained from multiple imaging modalities or radiotracers. We propose to develop, optimize, and validate approaches for combining multiple image-derived parameters obtained from quantitative imaging procedures in order to optimally predict and assess treatment response. In particular, we propose to combine quantitative metrics from PET/CT, SPECT/CT, and MRI. We will first individually optimize the protocols, acquisition parameters, and imaging methods in order to get the most accurate and reliable parameters to combine. Optimally combining the parameters from different modalities requires knowledge of the reproducibility (precision) of the individual quantitative imaging parameters. We will thus use literature search, phantom studies, realistic simulations, and repeated patient studies to characterize the accuracy and precision of the individual quantitative imaging methods. We will then develop methods to combine the metrics to predict or assess treatment response per patient, per tumor and intra-tumor. We will apply and evaluate these methods in three clinical trials: dynamic and static FDG and FIT PET/CT to assess lung cancer response to cytotoxic chemotherapy; PET/CT and DCE- and DW-MRI in breast cancer response; and SPECT/CT, PET/CT and DCE- and DW-MRI to predict response of brain tumors to anti-angiogenic therapy. In these trials imaging parameters and their signatures will be linked to histology or survival outcomes to provide validation of the combined imaging parameter metrics.

"SCH: Proactive Health Monitoring Using Individualized Analysis of Tissue Elastic* DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Existing studies suggest that tissue elasticity is possibly correlated with the aggressiveness of cancers. Based on results from deformable image registration, the proposed project investigates the possibility of tracking the organs movement subject to external forces and geometric constraints, thereby deducing patient-specific tissue elasticity parameters for proactive health monitoring. The objectives of this exploratory research project are (1) to develop a computational framework based on extensive studies of a large cohort of cancer patients, in order to accurately estimate patent-specific tissu elasticity using a coupled biomechanical simulation-optimization framework on a pair of medical images (possibly from ultrasound, mammography, computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance imaging, or other imaging technologies); (2) to examine potential association between tissue elasticity in different regions with aggressiveness of know/diagnosed cancer in the corresponding regions; (3) to derive predictive models for cancer staging/grading based on recovered patient-specific tissue elasticity and other explanatory variables; (4) to design a health monitoring system based on individualized analysis of tissue elasticity for 'at-risk' groups  who are more likely to develop cancers. This proposal describes a truly ambitious effort and a bold vision that is built upon the investigators' prior scientific accomplishments and strong credentials to potentially transform existing practice to more proactive, preventive, evidence-based health monitoring for individuals at risk of developing cancers. This research is expected to make several major scientific advances. These include new algorithms for non-invasive, image-based techniques for automatic extraction of tissue elasticity parameters without force applications and/or force sensing devices, novel regression models and inference procedures for survival analysis, new force sensing devices, novel regression models and inference procedures for survival analysis, new predictive models for cancer staging and grading based on patient-specific tissue elasticity parameters, and a health monitoring system for at-risk groups based on individual tissue elasticity along with other variables.

"Multi-Modality Quantitiative Imaging for Evaluation of Response to Cancer Therapy DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancers are heterogeneous in biology among patients, tumors in the same patient, and within tumors. As a result, they respond differently to therapy per patient, per tumor and within tumors. Different radiotracers and imaging modalities provide information about different aspects of biology and the physio-metabolic environments of the cancer. As a result, a single modality or radiotracer may not provide sufficient information to predict or assess response to therapy. We hypothesize that improved prediction and assessment of response can thus be obtained by combining quantitative image-derived parameters obtained from multiple imaging modalities or radiotracers. We propose to develop, optimize, and validate approaches for combining multiple image-derived parameters obtained from quantitative imaging procedures in order to optimally predict and assess treatment response. In particular, we propose to combine quantitative metrics from PET/CT, SPECT/CT, and MRI. We will first individually optimize the protocols, acquisition parameters, and imaging methods in order to get the most accurate and reliable parameters to combine. Optimally combining the parameters from different modalities requires knowledge of the reproducibility (precision) of the individual quantitative imaging parameters. We will thus use literature search, phantom studies, realistic simulations, and repeated patient studies to characterize the accuracy and precision of the individual quantitative imaging methods. We will then develop methods to combine the metrics to predict or assess treatment response per patient, per tumor and intra-tumor. We will apply and evaluate these methods in three clinical trials: dynamic and static FDG and FIT PET/CT to assess lung cancer response to cytotoxic chemotherapy; PET/CT and DCE- and DW-MRI in breast cancer response; and SPECT/CT, PET/CT and DCE- and DW-MRI to predict response of brain tumors to anti-angiogenic therapy. In these trials imaging parameters and their signatures will be linked to histology or survival outcomes to provide validation of the combined imaging parameter metrics.

"3D Image Analysis Approach to Determine Severity and Cause of Optic Nerve Edema DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Currently, the clinical assessment of optic nerve swelling is limited by the subjective ophthalmoscopic evaluation by experts in order to diagnose and differentiate the cause of the optic disc edema. The long-term goal of our research effort is to develop automated 3D image-analysis approaches for the identification of an optimal set of 3D parameters to quantify the severity of optic nerve edema over time and to help differentiate the underlying cause. The overall objective in this application is to develop strategies, using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), to rapidly and accurately determine the severity of optic nerve swelling in patients diagnosed with papilledema and to ascertain morphological features that differentiate papilledema from other disorders causing optic nerve edema.

"Functional and Structural Optical Coherence Tomography for Glaucoma PROJECT SUMMARY Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness. Early diagnosis and close monitoring of glaucoma are important because the onset is insidious and the damage is irreversible. Advanced imaging modalities such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) have been used in the past 2 decades to improve the objective evaluation of glaucoma. OCT has higher axial spatial resolution than other posterior eye imaging modalities and can precisely measure neural structures. However, structural imaging alone has limited sensitivity for detecting early glaucoma and only moderate correlation with visual field (VF) loss. Using high-speed OCT systems, we have developed novel OCT angiography technologies to image vascular plexuses that supply the retinal nerve fibers and ganglion cells damaged by glaucoma. Our results showed that OCT angiographic parameters have better correlation with VF parameters. We have also found that measurement of focal and sectoral glaucoma damage using high-definition volumetric OCT angiographic and structural parameters improves diagnostic performance. The goal of the proposed project is to further improve the diagnosis and monitoring of glaucoma using ultrahigh-speed OCT and artificial intelligence machine learning techniques. The specific aims are: 1. Develop quantitative wide-field OCT angiography. We will develop a swept-source OCT prototype that  is 4 times faster than current commercial OCT systems. The higher speed will be used to fully sample the  neural structures and associated capillary plexuses damaged by glaucoma. 2. Simulate VF by combining structural and angiographic OCT. Preliminary results showed that both  structural and angiographic OCT parameters have high correlation with VF on a sector basis. It may be  possible to accurately simulate VF results by combining these parameters using an artificial neural  network. The simulated VF may be more precise and reliable than subjective VF testing. 3. Longitudinal clinical study in glaucoma diagnosis and monitoring. Our novel OCT structural and  angiographic parameters have high accuracy in diagnosing glaucoma. Neural network analysis of structural  and angiographic data from a larger clinical study could further improve diagnostic accuracy. Longitudinal  follow-up will assess if simulated VF could monitor disease progression as well as actual VF. 4. Clinical study to assess the effects of glaucoma treatments. Preliminary results suggest that OCT  angiography could detect the improvement in capillary density after glaucoma surgery and the effects of  drugs. These intriguing effects will be tested in before-and-after comparison studies. If successful, we will have an OCT diagnostic system that in minutes provides objective information on the location and severity of glaucoma damage. This approach could replace time-consuming and unreliable VF testing. Measuring the improvement in retinal circulation could be a quicker way to detect the benefit of glaucoma therapies that work through neuroprotection or regeneration, compared to monitoring VF.

"3D Image Analysis Approach to Determine Severity and Cause of Optic Nerve Edema DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Currently, the clinical assessment of optic nerve swelling is limited by the subjective ophthalmoscopic evaluation by experts in order to diagnose and differentiate the cause of the optic disc edema. The long-term goal of our research effort is to develop automated 3D image-analysis approaches for the identification of an optimal set of 3D parameters to quantify the severity of optic nerve edema over time and to help differentiate the underlying cause. The overall objective in this application is to develop strategies, using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), to rapidly and accurately determine the severity of optic nerve swelling in patients diagnosed with papilledema and to ascertain morphological features that differentiate papilledema from other disorders causing optic nerve edema. The central hypothesis is that information about volumetric and shape parameters obtainable from 3D image analysis techniques will improve the ability to accurately assess the severity and cause of optic disc edema over the existing subjective ophthalmoscopic assessment of optic nerve swelling using the Fris�n scale or current 2D OCT parameters. The rationale for the proposed research is that having such 3D parameters will dramatically improve the way optic disc swelling is assessed. The following specific aims will be pursued: 1. Develop and evaluate the methodology for computing novel volumetric and shape parameters of a swollen optic nerve head from SD-OCT. This will be completed by refining and evaluating our novel 3D graph-based segmentation algorithms in SD-OCT volumes of patients with optic disc swelling. 2. Identify SD-OCT parameters that optimally correlate with clinical measurements of severity in patients with papilledema and develop a continuous severity scale. This will be accomplished by using machine-learning approaches to relate SD-OCT parameters to expert-defined Fris�n scale grades (a fundus-based measure of severity). It is anticipated that volumetric 3D parameters will more closely correlate with clinical measures than 2D parameters and will provide a continuous severity scale. 3. Identify SD-OCT parameters that differentiate papilledema from other causes of optic disc swelling (or apparent optic disc swelling, as in pseudopapilledema) and develop a corresponding predictive classifier. Our working hypothesis is that 3D shape parameters, especially those near Bruch's membrane opening, will contribute the most in the automatic differentiation process. The approach is innovative because the 3D image-analysis methodology developed by the applicants enables novel determination of 3D volumetric and shape parameters and represents a significant improvement over the status quo of using qualitative image information and 2D OCT image information for assessing optic disc swelling. The proposed research is significant because it will help to establish a much-needed alternative and more objective method by which to assess the severity and cause of optic disc swelling. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because the identification of novel spectral-domain optical coherence tomography parameters for assessing the severity and cause of optic nerve edema is expected to enable more efficient and effective diagnosis and management strategies of patients with such swelling. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge to reduce the burdens of disability and is particularly relevant to the part of NEI's mission regarding understanding blinding eye diseases and preserving sight.",3D Image Analysis Approach to Determine Severity and Cause of Optic Nerve Edema,9264531,R01EY023279,"['Algorithms ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Hydrops ', ' Dropsy ', ' Edema ', ' ophthalmopathy ', ' eye disorder ', ' Eye diseases ', ' Goals ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mission ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Nerve Fibers ', ' Optic Disk ', ' Optic Papilla ', ' Optic Nerve Head ', ' Optic Nerve ', ' Second Cranial Nerve ', ' Cranial Nerve II ', ' optic nerve disorder ', ' second cranial nerve disorder ', ' Second Cranial Nerve Diseases ', ' Optic Neuropathy ', ' Optic Nerve Diseases ', ' Neural-Optical Lesion ', ' Cranial Nerve II Disorder ', ' Cranial Nerve II Diseases ', ' Papilledema ', ' Optic Papilla Edema ', ' Optic Disk Edema ', ' Choked Disk ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Swelling ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' Work ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Measures ', ' Lamina Basalis Choroideae ', ' Bruchs membrane ', "" Bruch's membrane "", ' Bruch Membrane ', "" Bruch's basal membrane structure "", ' raised intracranial pressure ', ' raised ICP ', ' Intracranial Pressure Increase ', ' Intracranial Pressure Elevation ', ' Elevated Intracranial Pressure ', ' Intracranial Hypertension ', ' base ', ' Funduscopes ', ' Ophthalmoscopes ', ' improved ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Measurement ', ' Morphology ', ' Shapes ', ' instrument ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Diagnostic Procedure ', ' Diagnostic Technique ', ' Diagnostic Method ', ' Dimensions ', ' Severities ', ' Techniques ', ' Blindness ', ' visual loss ', ' vision loss ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' Structure ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' Graph ', ' Categories ', ' Modality ', ' Fundus ', ' Optical Coherence Tomography ', ' optical coherence Doppler tomography ', ' optical Doppler tomography ', ' OCT Tomography ', ' Doppler OCT ', ' Three-Dimensional Image ', ' 3D images ', ' 3D image ', ' 3-D image ', ' 3-D Images ', ' Thick ', ' Thickness ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' cost ', ' optic imaging ', ' optical imaging ', ' digital ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' disability burden ', ' public health relevance ', ' Algorithmic Analysis ', ' Analysis of Algorithms ', ' Analyses of Algorithms ', ' Algorithmic Analyses ', ' ']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2017,339750,IA-02,0.24549539992951844
"A Quality Control Program for Quantitative MRI Data  Acquisition and Analysis in Multi-site Clinical Trials Project Summary/Abstract There has been a shift to greater use of neadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) in the clinical management of cancer. Often used in breast cancer to provide systemic treatment for possible or apparent metastatic disease, NACT also reduces the primary tumor size and facilitates breast conservation. Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (qMRI) is an effective diagnostic for monitoring tumor regression. There are many methodologies being developed for monitoring cancer in vivo, including contrast agent washout, volumetry, and more recently correlating apparent diffusion coefficients and proton relaxation times to tumor staging. Such imaging biomarkers are predictive of the pathological complete response (pCR) outcome prior to surgery. This enables physicians to provide “evidence based” treatment modifications to reduce deleterious side effects and improve patient outcomes. To obtain quantitative data from MR images, the variations that occur in imaging as a result of hardware and software differences between MRI manufacturers and day-to-day operations must be quantified. In MRI, the data depends on the protocols used to acquire the image, resulting in inconsistencies if even one parameter in the protocol changes. The goal of the proposed work is to produce and develop and disseminate a ground truth physical standard and quality control program for comparison of MRI scanners in the multisite I-SPY2 (ACRIN 6698) trials monitoring pre-operative chemotherapy treatments in the reduction of tumor size. The physical standard is an anthropomorphic breast phantom capable of fitting into all commercial breast coils. It contains novel human tissue mimics and geometric standards with values traceable to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Analysis software capable of protocol compliance checks, rapid identification of the regions of interest, and comparison to ground truth values as measured by NIST will be developed to complement the physical standard. This will enable qualification of sites and quantification of error resulting from scanner performance alone. Given the wide breadth of parameter space that MRI protocols encompass, part of the proposed effort will include the development of protocols specific to image acquisition of tumor volumes and for measuring the apparent diffusion coefficient within the tumor volumes as compared to surrounding healthy tissue. Project Narrative: Quantitative imaging complements precision medicine initiatives by providing a noninvasive method of monitoring gene specific in vivo treatment of diseases ranging from cancer to neurological disorders. To realize quantitative imaging, variations in imaging hardware, software, and procedures must be mitigated. This project will develop a quality assurance and quality control procedure for multisite clinical trials involved in monitoring therapeutic efficacy using MR breast imaging.",A Quality Control Program for Quantitative MRI Data  Acquisition and Analysis in Multi-site Clinical Trials,9678297,R44CA235820,"['Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Contrast Media ', ' Radiopaque Media ', ' Contrast Drugs ', ' Contrast Agent ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Diffusion ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Fats ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Head ', ' Institutes ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging ', ' Tumor Staging ', ' Neoplasm Staging ', ' Cancer Staging ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Production ', ' Protons ', ' Hydrogen Ions ', ' H+ element ', ' Quality Control ', ' Reading ', ' Relaxation ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Standardization ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Vendor ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' base ', ' quality assurance ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Site ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' human tissue ', ' Scanning ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Tumor Volume ', ' Protocol Compliance ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' interest ', ' Magnetism ', ' magnetic ', ' Performance ', ' In complete remission ', ' complete response ', ' Primary Neoplasm ', ' Primary Tumor ', ' novel ', ' Disease regression ', ' Reporting ', ' protocol development ', ' Adverse effects ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Manufacturer Name ', ' Manufacturer ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial ', ' multi site clinical trial ', ' multi site clinical study ', ' multi center clinical trial ', ' multi center clinical study ', ' Multi-site clinical trial ', ' Multi-site clinical study ', ' Multi-center clinical trial ', ' Multi-center clinical study ', ' Reproducibility ', ' in vivo ', ' ACRIN ', ' American College of Radiology Imaging Network ', ' Clinical Management ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Pathologic ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Evidence based treatment ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' data acquisition ', ' chemotherapy ', ' non-invasive monitor ', ' tumor ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' treatment response ', ' operation ', ' computer assisted detection ', ' computer aided detection ', ' cloud based ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' precision medicine ', ' Precision Medicine Initiative ', ' predictive molecular biomarker ', ' predictive biomarkers ', ' predictive marker ', ' quantitative imaging ', ' mammary imaging ', ' breast imaging ', ' imaging marker ', ' imaging biomarker ', ' Breast conservation ', ' Breast MRI ', ' Breast Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' deep learning ', ' ']",NCI,"CALIBERMRI, INC.",R44,2018,224422,CO-02,-0.0004973798628480515
"Functional and Structural Optical Coherence Tomography for Glaucoma PROJECT SUMMARY Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness. Early diagnosis and close monitoring of glaucoma are important because the onset is insidious and the damage is irreversible. Advanced imaging modalities such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) have been used in the past 2 decades to improve the objective evaluation of glaucoma. OCT has higher axial spatial resolution than other posterior eye imaging modalities and can precisely measure neural structures. However, structural imaging alone has limited sensitivity for detecting early glaucoma and only moderate correlation with visual field (VF) loss. Using high-speed OCT systems, we have developed novel OCT angiography technologies to image vascular plexuses that supply the retinal nerve fibers and ganglion cells damaged by glaucoma. Our results showed that OCT angiographic parameters have better correlation with VF parameters. We have also found that measurement of focal and sectoral glaucoma damage using high-definition volumetric OCT angiographic and structural parameters improves diagnostic performance. The goal of the proposed project is to further improve the diagnosis and monitoring of glaucoma using ultrahigh-speed OCT and artificial intelligence machine learning techniques. The specific aims are: 1. Develop quantitative wide-field OCT angiography. We will develop a swept-source OCT prototype that  is 4 times faster than current commercial OCT systems. The higher speed will be used to fully sample the  neural structures and associated capillary plexuses damaged by glaucoma. 2. Simulate VF by combining structural and angiographic OCT. Preliminary results showed that both  structural and angiographic OCT parameters have high correlation with VF on a sector basis. It may be  possible to accurately simulate VF results by combining these parameters using an artificial neural  network. The simulated VF may be more precise and reliable than subjective VF testing. 3. Longitudinal clinical study in glaucoma diagnosis and monitoring. Our novel OCT structural and  angiographic parameters have high accuracy in diagnosing glaucoma. Neural network analysis of structural  and angiographic data from a larger clinical study could further improve diagnostic accuracy. Longitudinal  follow-up will assess if simulated VF could monitor disease progression as well as actual VF. 4. Clinical study to assess the effects of glaucoma treatments. Preliminary results suggest that OCT  angiography could detect the improvement in capillary density after glaucoma surgery and the effects of  drugs. These intriguing effects will be tested in before-and-after comparison studies. If successful, we will have an OCT diagnostic system that in minutes provides objective information on the location and severity of glaucoma damage. This approach could replace time-consuming and unreliable VF testing.

"Motion-Resolved, Comprehensive Quantitative Tissue Characterization Using MR Multitasking PROJECT SUMMARY  Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures tissue parameters such as T1, T2, T2*, and diffusion to detect subtle differences in tissue states (such as microstructure, diffuse fibrosis, edema, hemorrhage, and iron content) from neurological, oncological, and cardiovascular diseases. Because each parameter offers complementary tissue information, multiparameter mapping is very promising for risk assessment, early detection, accurate staging, and treatment monitoring of disease. However, quantitative MRI is typically very time consuming and difficult to perform. Each parameter is typically measured from its own series of images, so measuring multiple parameters leads to long, inefficient scanning sessions. Furthermore, cardiac and breathing motion creates misalignment between images, causing additional problems.  The standard approach to motion is to either remove it (e.g., ask the patient to hold their breath) or to synchronize image acquisition with it (e.g., using electrocardiography (ECG) to monitor cardiac motion). This approach makes scan times even longer, limits imaging to patients who can repeatedly perform long breath holds (which is difficult for aging or weak patients) and who have predictable cardiac motion (which is not true of patients with cardiac arrhythmias). Furthermore, these methods are often unreliable and difficult to perform.  This project is to develop and validate a new technology, MR Multitasking, to perform multiple simultaneous measurements in a single, push-button scan that is both comfortable for patients and simple for technologists to perform. MR Multitasking redesigns quantitative MRI around the concept of images as functions of many time dimensions, each corresponding to a different dynamic process (e.g., motion, T1, T2, T2*, and diffusion), and then uses mathematical models called low-rank tensors to perform fast, multidimensional imaging. This allows continuous acquisition of imaging data even while the subject is moving, providing motion-resolved parameter maps without breath holding or motion synchronization. We will scan healthy subjects, liver patients, prostate cancer patients, and cardiovascular patients to develop and validate this technology and use artificial intelligence to quickly reconstruct images from the collected data. The resulting tool will be applicable to any organ system, offering clinicians and investigators a valuable tool to answer a wide range of biomedical questions. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This project is to develop and validate a one-stop, push-button solution for comprehensive, motion- resolved quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This will be accomplished by cultivating a new technology, MR Multitasking, which can measure multiple tissue biomarkers in a single scan, even in moving organs.

A goal of this project is to determine if this objective imaging technology can provide information that is equivalent to or better than subjective visual field testing, which though time-consuming and poorly reliable, is the current gold standard for long-term monitoring and management of glaucoma.",Functional and Structural Optical Coherence Tomography for Glaucoma,9697824,R01EY023285,"['Abbreviations ', ' Affect ', ' Angiography ', ' angiographic imaging ', ' Angiogram ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Biomedical Engineering ', ' bioengineering ', ' bio-engineers ', ' bio-engineered ', ' Blood Circulation ', ' Circulation ', ' Bloodstream ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Blood capillaries ', ' capillary ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye ', ' Eye Drops ', ' Eyedrops ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' glaucomatous ', ' Glaucoma ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Grant ', ' intra-ocular pressure ', ' Ocular Tension ', ' Intraocular Pressure ', ' Physiologic Intraocular Pressure ', ' Laser Radiation ', ' Laser Electromagnetic ', ' Lasers ', ' Methods ', ' Nerve Fibers ', ' Noise ', ' Optic Papilla ', ' Optic Nerve Head ', ' Optic Disk ', ' Patients ', ' Perfusion ', ' Postoperative ', ' Post-Operative ', ' Postoperative Period ', ' regenerate ', ' Regeneration ', ' Natural regeneration ', ' Research ', ' Retina ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Safety ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Trabeculoplasty ', ' Trabeculectomy ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' eye field ', ' Visual Fields ', ' Work ', ' vascular component ', ' vascular factor ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' glaucoma surgery ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' ganglion cell ', ' gangliocyte ', ' Blood flow ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Functional disorder ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Scanning ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Blindness ', ' visual loss ', ' vision loss ', ' Shunt Device ', ' shunts ', ' Shunt ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Visit ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' fiber cell ', ' field study ', ' field test ', ' field learning ', ' field based data ', ' Performance ', ' diagnostic accuracy ', ' Accuracy of Diagnosis ', ' neuroprotection ', ' cell injury ', ' cell damage ', ' Cellular injury ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Glossary ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Sampling ', ' Optical Coherence Tomography ', ' optical coherence Doppler tomography ', ' optical Doppler tomography ', ' OCT Tomography ', ' Doppler OCT ', ' imaging method ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Data ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Resolution ', ' Monitor ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' macula ', ' macular ', ' Outcome ', ' Retinal ', ' Imaging technology ', ' Consumption ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' analytical tool ', ' treatment effect ', ' prototype ', ' visual performance ', ' high risk ', ' clinical practice ', ' screening ', ' quantitative imaging ', ' bulk motion ', ' high resolution imaging ', ' Longitudinal observational study ', ' Longitudinal observation study ', ' artificial neural network ', ' synthetic neural network ', ' computational neural network ', ' artificial neural net ', ' neural network ', ' ']",NEI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,564228,OR-03,0.15748527644375068
"A Quality Control Program for Quantitative MRI Data  Acquisition and Analysis in Multi-site Clinical Trials Project Summary/Abstract There has been a shift to greater use of neadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) in the clinical management of cancer. Often used in breast cancer to provide systemic treatment for possible or apparent metastatic disease, NACT also reduces the primary tumor size and facilitates breast conservation. Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (qMRI) is an effective diagnostic for monitoring tumor regression. There are many methodologies being developed for monitoring cancer in vivo, including contrast agent washout, volumetry, and more recently correlating apparent diffusion coefficients and proton relaxation times to tumor staging. Such imaging biomarkers are predictive of the pathological complete response (pCR) outcome prior to surgery. This enables physicians to provide “evidence based” treatment modifications to reduce deleterious side effects and improve patient outcomes. To obtain quantitative data from MR images, the variations that occur in imaging as a result of hardware and software differences between MRI manufacturers and day-to-day operations must be quantified. In MRI, the data depends on the protocols used to acquire the image, resulting in inconsistencies if even one parameter in the protocol changes. The goal of the proposed work is to produce and develop and disseminate a ground truth physical standard and quality control program for comparison of MRI scanners in the multisite I-SPY2 (ACRIN 6698) trials monitoring pre-operative chemotherapy treatments in the reduction of tumor size. The physical standard is an anthropomorphic breast phantom capable of fitting into all commercial breast coils. It contains novel human tissue mimics and geometric standards with values traceable to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Analysis software capable of protocol compliance checks, rapid identification of the regions of interest, and comparison to ground truth values as measured by NIST will be developed to complement the physical standard. This will enable qualification of sites and quantification of error resulting from scanner performance alone. Given the wide breadth of parameter space that MRI protocols encompass, part of the proposed effort will include the development of protocols specific to image acquisition of tumor volumes and for measuring the apparent diffusion coefficient within the tumor volumes as compared to surrounding healthy tissue. Project Narrative: Quantitative imaging complements precision medicine initiatives by providing a noninvasive method of monitoring gene specific in vivo treatment of diseases ranging from cancer to neurological disorders. To realize quantitative imaging, variations in imaging hardware, software, and procedures must be mitigated. This project will develop a quality assurance and quality control procedure for multisite clinical trials involved in monitoring therapeutic efficacy using MR breast imaging.",A Quality Control Program for Quantitative MRI Data  Acquisition and Analysis in Multi-site Clinical Trials,10007270,R44CA235820,"['Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Radiopaque Media ', ' Contrast Drugs ', ' Contrast Agent ', ' Contrast Media ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Diffusion ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Elements ', ' Fats ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Head ', ' Institutes ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Tumor Staging ', ' Neoplasm Staging ', ' Cancer Staging ', ' Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Production ', ' Hydrogen Ions ', ' H+ element ', ' Protons ', ' Quality Control ', ' Reading ', ' Relaxation ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Standardization ', ' Teaching ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Vendor ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' base ', ' quality assurance ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Image Analysis ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Site ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' human tissue ', ' Scanning ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Tumor Volume ', ' Protocol Compliance ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' interest ', ' Magnetism ', ' magnetic ', ' Performance ', ' In complete remission ', ' complete response ', ' Primary Neoplasm ', ' Primary Tumor ', ' novel ', ' Disease regression ', ' Reporting ', ' protocol development ', ' Manufacturer Name ', ' Manufacturer ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial ', ' Multisite clinical trial ', ' Multisite clinical study ', ' Multicenter clinical trial ', ' Multicenter clinical study ', ' Multi-site clinical trial ', ' Multi-site clinical study ', ' Multi-center clinical trial ', ' Multi-center clinical study ', ' Reproducibility ', ' in vivo ', ' American College of Radiology Imaging Network ', ' ACRIN ', ' Clinical Management ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Pathologic ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Evidence based treatment ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' data acquisition ', ' chemotherapy ', ' non-invasive monitor ', ' noninvasive monitor ', ' tumor ', ' treatment response ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' operation ', ' computer aided detection ', ' computer assisted detection ', ' cloud based ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' Precision Medicine Initiative ', ' predictive marker ', ' predictive molecular biomarker ', ' predictive biomarkers ', ' quantitative imaging ', ' breast imaging ', ' mammary imaging ', ' imaging biomarker ', ' imaging-based marker ', ' imaging-based biomarker ', ' imaging-based biological marker ', ' imaging marker ', ' Breast conservation ', ' Breast Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Breast MRI ', ' deep learning ', ' side effect ', ' Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine ', ' DICOM ', ' ']",NCI,"CALIBERMRI, INC.",R44,2019,843717,CO-02,-0.0004973798628480515
"Toward a High Dimensional Computational Description of Variation in Human Decision-Making Across Psychiatric and Non-Psychiatric Populations TOWARD A HIGH DIMENSIONAL COMPUTATIONAL DESCRIPTION OF VARIATION IN HUMAN DECISION-MAKING ACROSS PSYCHIATRIC AND NON-PSYCHIATRIC POPULATIONS PI: Dr. John P. O'Doherty Institution: California Institute of Technology PROJECT SUMMARY  Computational psychiatry (CP) promises to gain deeper explanatory insight into psychiatric disorders through the application of formal computational models to task-related behavioral data and brain measures. However, research in CP to date has mostly involved a narrow unidimensional focus, utilizing either a relatively limited set of computational constructs such as simple model-free (MF) reinforcement learning (RL), and/or restricted to studying a specific task, a specific disease, or even a particular model parameter. For CP to reach its potential, we need to broaden the field's scope. To achieve this, it is necessary to develop an integrated theory and formal framework supported by a task battery that will enable the quantification of individual differences across a range of computational mechanisms pertinent to the diagnosis and treatment of clinical disorders. The objective of the current proposal is to implement the initial groundwork needed to build and test a computational framework and task battery that can facilitate a multi-dimensional computational description of individual variability in parameters relevant for characterizing psychiatric dysfunction.  We have constructed a computational assessment battery (CAB) consisting of four distinct yet inter- related tasks that move beyond simple RL to probe various aspects of learning, cognition, and decision-making. First, we assess learning about losses as well as rewards. Secondly, we measure model-based (MB) alongside simple MF learning and decision making, and the arbitration allocating control to either strategy. Thirdly, we examine strategies for solving the exploration/exploitation dilemma, in which individuals have to decide whether to exploit an option known to yield reward or explore an option whose outcomes are unknown. Finally, we assess social-learning, in which an individual can either infer the goals of another individual or simply imitate that agent's behavior.  We propose to build an integrated computational model that can capture relevant computations being implemented in each of the tasks in our battery, alongside a hierarchical model-fitting and parameter estimation framework to enable us to retrieve reliable parameter estimates for each computational variable of interest. We will leverage common computational mechanisms engaged across our task battery to improve estimability and generalizability. We will then acquire behavioral data in a large on-line (n=1000), and modest (n=100) in-lab sample on the CAB to establish the internal validity and test/re-test reliability of our computational model and parameter estimates. Finally, we will explore the relationship between model-estimated parameter estimates from behavior on our task battery and variability in self-reported traits and states relevant for psychiatric disease in our healthy samples, as well as in a pilot sample (n=60) of patients recruited from the UCLA psychiatry outpatient clinics. These efforts will form the basis of a Computational Psychiatry Toolbox for behavioral testing, model-fitting and parameter estimation that will eventually be released as a resource to the research community. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our goal is to develop a comprehensive approach to characterize an individual's ability to think, learn and make decisions in terms of a series of specific brain processes or `computations'. We then aim to determine whether variation in these computations can in turn be related to a variety of symptoms that can occur in psychiatric disorders. To achieve this, we will develop new mathematical and experimental tools to assess variation in behavior across individuals, and refine, test and validate these tools in a preliminary sample of healthy participants and psychiatric patients.",Toward a High Dimensional Computational Description of Variation in Human Decision-Making Across Psychiatric and Non-Psychiatric Populations,9827920,R21MH120805,"['Ambulatory Care Facilities ', ' Outpatient Clinics ', ' Anxiety ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' California ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Cognition ', ' Communities ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Goals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Institutes ', ' Learning ', ' Math ', ' Mathematics ', ' Moods ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' Patients ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Validity and Reliability ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Rewards ', ' Supervision ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Measures ', ' Arbitrating ', ' Arbitration ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Psychiatric therapeutic procedure ', ' psychiatric treatment ', ' psychiatric therapy ', ' psychiatric care ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Undifferentiated ', ' Ensure ', ' insight ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Plant Roots ', ' root ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' participant recruitment ', ' Functional disorder ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' tool ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' trait ', ' Participant ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' behavior test ', ' behavioral test ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Institution ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' trial treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' computer framework ', ' computational framework ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Individual Differences ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' computer algorithm ', ' large scale simulation ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted therapy ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' social learning ', ' high dimensionality ', ' recruit ', ' individual variation ', ' individual variability ', ' individual heterogeneity ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' ']",NIMH,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R21,2019,260395,CA-27,0.11221055407047963
"Novel Glaucoma Diagnostics for Structure and Function  - Renewal - 1 Project Summary Glaucoma is a leading cause of vision morbidity and blindness worldwide. Early disease detection and sensitive monitoring of progression are crucial to allow timely treatment for preservation of vision. The introduction of ocular imaging technologies significantly improves these capabilities, but in clinical practice there are still substantial challenges at certain stages of the disease severity spectrum, specifically in the early stage and in advanced disease. These difficulties are due to a variety of causes that change over the course of the disease, including large between-subject variability, inherent measurement variability, image quality, varying dynamic ranges of measurements, minimal measurable level of tissues, etc. In this proposal, we build on our long-standing contribution to ocular imaging and propose novel and sensitive means to detect glaucoma and its progression that are optimized to the various stages of disease severity. We will use information gathered from visual fields (functional information) and a leading ocular imaging technology – optical coherence tomography (OCT; structural information) to map the capability of detecting changes across the entire disease severity spectrum to identify optimal parameters for each stage of the disease. Both commonly used parameters provided by the technologies and newly developed parameters with good diagnostic potential will be analyzed. We will use state-of-the-art automated computerized machine learning methods, namely the deep learning approach, to identify structural features embedded within OCT images that are associated with glaucoma and its progression without any a priori assumptions. This will provide novel insight into structural information, and has shown very encouraging preliminary results. We will also utilize a new imaging technology, the visible light OCT, to generate retinal images with outstanding resolution to extract information about the oxygen saturation of the tissue. This will provide in-vivo, real time, and noninvasive insight into tissue functionality. Taken together, this program will advance the use of structural and functional information with a substantial impact on the clinical management of subjects with glaucoma Project Narrative This research proposal is focusing on the development and refinement of innovative analytical methods and cutting-edge technologies that will substantially improve detection of glaucoma and its progression monitoring in order to prevent blindness.",Novel Glaucoma Diagnostics for Structure and Function  - Renewal - 1,9819321,R01EY013178,"['Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye ', ' Floor ', ' Future ', ' glaucomatous ', ' Glaucoma ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Laboratories ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Maps ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Optic Papilla ', ' Optic Nerve Head ', ' Optic Disk ', ' Oxygen Consumption ', ' Pathology ', ' Research Proposals ', ' retinopathy ', ' retina disorder ', ' retina disease ', ' Retinal Disorder ', ' Retinal Diseases ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' structure function relationship ', ' chemical structure function ', ' Structure-Activity Relationship ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Tissue Extracts ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' eye field ', ' Visual Fields ', ' Measures ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' ganglion cell ', ' gangliocyte ', ' insight ', ' Visible Radiation ', ' Visible Light Radiation ', ' Visible Light ', ' Measurement ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Metabolic ', ' tool ', ' instrument ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Scanning ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' 3D ', ' 3-D ', ' Blindness ', ' visual loss ', ' vision loss ', ' Width ', ' Severity of illness ', ' disease severity ', ' Oxygen saturation measurement ', ' Oximetry ', ' innovative technologies ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' cohort ', ' knowledge base ', ' knowledgebase ', ' Structure ', ' advanced disease ', ' advanced illness ', ' novel ', ' research study ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' Modeling ', ' tissue oxygenation ', ' tissue oxygen saturation ', ' Optical Coherence Tomography ', ' optical coherence Doppler tomography ', ' optical Doppler tomography ', ' OCT Tomography ', ' Doppler OCT ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Inner Plexiform Layer ', ' Measurable ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Clinical Management ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' computerized ', ' macula ', ' macular ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' Outcome ', ' Retinal ', ' Imaging technology ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' retinal nerve fiber layer ', ' RNFL ', ' clinical practice ', ' mathematical methods ', ' mathematics methods ', ' mathematics methodology ', ' mathematics approach ', ' mathematical methodology ', ' mathematical approach ', ' math methods ', ' math methodology ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' invention ', ' longitudinal dataset ', ' longitudinal data set ', ' preservation ', ' retinal imaging ', ' retina imaging ', ' ocular imaging ', ' deep learning ', ' ']",NEI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,715489,NY-12,0.10461749855903234
"Generalizing Deep Learning Reconstruction for Free-Breathing and Quantitative MRI Project Summary/Abstract The goal of this project is to increase the precision and resolution of quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Quantitative information such as tissue relaxation parameters (e.g., T1 and T2) measure tissue function and indicate disease-related changes in the heart, liver, brain, and other organs. For instance, T1 changes can provide evidence of diffuse fibrosis in the myocardium that can signal heart disease. Quantitative maps also are reproducible, directly comparable longitudinally and across subjects, and less affected by the properties of the scanner used, when compared versus common weighted (non-quantitative) clinical imaging. But, quantitative imaging involves more complicated and time-consuming pulse sequences. To accomplish this goal, this project will develop new machine learning algorithms for high-quality parameter mapping from free-breathing data. The first aim of this project will increase parameter map resolution achievable from highly accelerated, noisy data. The proposed method will integrate existing deep cascade network-based image reconstructions with convolutional network-based blocks for super-resolution and parameter map estimation. Preliminary studies suggest these new blocks improve sharpness and mitigate artifacts in the reconstructed parameter maps. The next aim will improve the training precision of such artificial neural networks to account for the significant per-voxel nonlinear fit variability in quantitative MRI. The proposed method will reweight the loss function used for calibrating these networks by the goodness-of-fit (coefficient of determination) of the reference maps obtained from fully sampled training data. Preliminary results demonstrate that quality-aware reweighting significantly improves reconstructed image quality when working with noisy training data. Experiments will evaluate the precision of both of these innovations against existing deep-learning-based reconstructions on T1 maps obtained from pre- and post-contrast cardiac images of volunteer patients. The final aim will address motion during the acquisition by estimating and tracking nonrigid motion in the data consistency stages of the deep cascade artificial neural network architecture. Two methods are proposed: deformable motion estimation already demonstrated on compressive model-based image reconstructions, and a new “re-blurring” convolutional neural network that automatically introduces artifacts into a “clean” image to match the motion-corrupted data. Both of these methods enforce consistency between motion-affected data and a motion-free image during the reconstruction. Both methods will be validated on both cardiac and abdominal images for motion artifacts and reconstruction quality against breath-held parameter mapping acquisitions. Project Narrative Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging noninvasively measures physical properties of tissue connected to cardiovascular disease and many other conditions. Novel machine learning methods for processing data to produce higher quality maps will facilitate earlier and more accurate treatment of these diseases.

"Development of Multi-Compartment MR-Fingerprinting for Subvoxel Estimation of Quantitative Tissue Biomarkers Project Summary Magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF) has been proposed as a technique to quantify tissue parameters, such as T1 and T2 relaxation times, which are biomarkers for various pathologies. One assumption of MRF is that the signal in each voxel is generated by exactly one set of tissue parameters. Due to MRI resolution at the range of millimeter in combination with the cellular structure of biological tissue, each voxel consists of multiple tissue compartments. An over-simplified single compartment model results in apparent relaxation times that are influenced by the relaxation times and the fractional proton densities of all contributing compartments. This can lead to a misinterpretation of signal changes. For example, in diseases that causes demyelination in white matter (Multiple Sclerosis, Dementia), a reduction of the myelin water fraction would result in a misleading change of the apparent relaxation time of the voxel. We propose a multi-compartment MRF method that allows to identify multiple tissue contributions within a voxel, including the fractional proton density (PD) of different compartments. Our machine learning based approach automatically identifies the number of compartments within each voxel that can be identified with the available SNR in that voxel. We will correct for partial-volume effects at the borders of two types of tissues, as well as analyze tissue microstructure. For the second case our learned model will also include chemical exchange between compartments. After an initial validation phase using numerical simulations, we will first perform MRF scans of dedicated 3D printed phantoms with multiple compartments. Our quality criterion is successful estimation of all simulated tissue compartments for all voxels with a relative error of less than 5% to the ground truth. We will then perform in-vivo MRF measurements of healthy volunteers (n=5). We will generate synthetic FLAIR and MP-RAGE contrasts from parameter maps estimated with conventional and the proposed multi-compartment MRF technique. We will compare them with currently used clinical contrasts acquired using established pulse sequences and validate the performance of our approach by measuring the cortical thickness. Further, we will validate the performance for microstructure composition in white matter. Our hypothesis is that it will be possible separate the compartments for myelin, intra- and extra-cellular water and compare the results to ex-vivo data found in literature. In summary, the methods developed in this R21 proposal will provide a novel technique to accurately and reproducibly identify biomarkers beyond the resolution of a voxel. It will allow to identify changes in tissue composition and fractional proton density at the microstructure level. Project Narrative The overarching goal of this proposal is to establish a MR imaging technique for quantifying biomarkers at the sub-voxel level. We will develop a machine learning based MR fingerprinting image reconstruction that enables the identification and characterization of multiple compartments within a voxel in terms of fractional proton density and relaxation times. We will generate accurate synthetic fluid suppressed images such as the FLAIR and MP- RAGE with accurate partial volume behavior and analyze the myelin water fraction and the corresponding relaxation times in white matter.",Development of Multi-Compartment MR-Fingerprinting for Subvoxel Estimation of Quantitative Tissue Biomarkers,9825278,R21EB027241,"['Behavior ', ' spinal fluid ', ' cerebral spinal fluid ', ' Cerebrospinal Fluid ', ' Demyelinations ', ' Diagnosis ', ' computer-assisted diagnostics ', ' Computer aided diagnosis ', ' Computer-Assisted Diagnosis ', ' Dictionary ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Elements ', ' Fingerprint ', ' Goals ', ' substantia grisea ', ' gray matter ', ' image generation ', ' image construction ', ' image reconstruction ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' insular sclerosis ', ' Disseminated Sclerosis ', ' Multiple Sclerosis ', ' Myelin ', ' Noise ', ' Pathology ', ' Physics ', ' Hydrogen Ions ', ' H+ element ', ' Protons ', ' Relaxation ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Standardization ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Water ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Measures ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Chemicals ', ' Training ', ' soft tissue ', ' Measurement ', ' Cellular Structures ', ' Cell Structure ', ' Cell Components ', ' noninvasive diagnosis ', ' noninvasive diagnostic ', ' non-invasive diagnostic ', ' non-invasive diagnosis ', ' Multicenter Studies ', ' Multi-center studies ', ' Liquid substance ', ' liquid ', ' fluid ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Pulse ', ' millimeter ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Scanning ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' Neurodegenerative Disorders ', ' neurodegenerative illness ', ' degenerative neurological diseases ', ' degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons ', ' Neurologic Degenerative Conditions ', ' Neurodegenerative Diseases ', ' Neural degenerative Disorders ', ' Neural Degenerative Diseases ', ' Nervous System Degenerative Diseases ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Disorders ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Diseases ', ' Performance ', ' physical process ', ' Physical Phenomena or Properties ', ' simulation ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' novel ', ' white matter ', ' substantia alba ', ' Modeling ', ' Magnetic Resonance ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Validation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' reconstruction ', ' conditioning ', ' healthy volunteer ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' 3D Print ', ' three dimensional printing ', ' 3D printer ', ' 3-D printer ', ' 3-D print ', ' imaging system ', ' tissue biomarkers ', ' magnetic resonance imaging biomarker ', ' MRI biomarker ', ' clinical translation ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' ']",NIBIB,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R21,2019,209851,NY-12,0.0704646536883501
"Quantitative MR Imaging of Vascular Factors in Parkinsons Disease Abstract Vascular health has been shown to be an important factor in the development of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. Hence, the ability to measure reliably and quantitatively early hemodynamic changes in the aging brain can be a powerful tool for diagnosing, studying, and developing treatments. Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL) magnetic resonance imaging can yield quantitative perfusion images without the use of contrast agents. We propose that combining new ASL techniques, such as Velocity Selective Inversion (VSI) labeling pulses and magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF) with deep learning regression methods will allow quantification of multiple hemodynamic parameters beyond perfusion, thus providing a much more nuanced picture of the state of the vasculature. We also expect that the new technique will offer dramatic improvements in SNR, specificity and sensitivity of ASL, and that the proposed techniques will have many other applications in research and in the clinic. We propose to use these techniques to fill the knowledge gap regarding the relationship between vascular changes and Parkinson’s disease and its symptoms, particularly fatigue, whose pathogenesis is not well understood. If we are successful in this application, future work will use the hemodynamic parameters of interest as biomarkers to assess risk of neurodegeneration, determine therapeutic targets, and guide in the development of new therapies. Public Health Statement Vascular health is an important factor in the development of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases We propose to develop a method that can produce quantifiable images of multiple blood flow related parameters with a single scan and without the use of contrast injections.

"Novel Glaucoma Diagnostics for Structure and Function  - Renewal - 1 Project Summary Glaucoma is a leading cause of vision morbidity and blindness worldwide. Early disease detection and sensitive monitoring of progression are crucial to allow timely treatment for preservation of vision. The introduction of ocular imaging technologies significantly improves these capabilities, but in clinical practice there are still substantial challenges at certain stages of the disease severity spectrum, specifically in the early stage and in advanced disease. These difficulties are due to a variety of causes that change over the course of the disease, including large between-subject variability, inherent measurement variability, image quality, varying dynamic ranges of measurements, minimal measurable level of tissues, etc. In this proposal, we build on our long-standing contribution to ocular imaging and propose novel and sensitive means to detect glaucoma and its progression that are optimized to the various stages of disease severity. We will use information gathered from visual fields (functional information) and a leading ocular imaging technology – optical coherence tomography (OCT; structural information) to map the capability of detecting changes across the entire disease severity spectrum to identify optimal parameters for each stage of the disease. Both commonly used parameters provided by the technologies and newly developed parameters with good diagnostic potential will be analyzed. We will use state-of-the-art automated computerized machine learning methods, namely the deep learning approach, to identify structural features embedded within OCT images that are associated with glaucoma and its progression without any a priori assumptions. This will provide novel insight into structural information, and has shown very encouraging preliminary results. We will also utilize a new imaging technology, the visible light OCT, to generate retinal images with outstanding resolution to extract information about the oxygen saturation of the tissue. This will provide in-vivo, real time, and noninvasive insight into tissue functionality. Taken together, this program will advance the use of structural and functional information with a substantial impact on the clinical management of subjects with glaucoma Project Narrative This research proposal is focusing on the development and refinement of innovative analytical methods and cutting-edge technologies that will substantially improve detection of glaucoma and its progression monitoring in order to prevent blindness.",Novel Glaucoma Diagnostics for Structure and Function  - Renewal - 1,10019553,R01EY013178,"['Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Floor ', ' Future ', ' Glaucoma ', ' glaucomatous ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Maps ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Optic Disk ', ' Optic Nerve Head ', ' Optic Papilla ', ' Oxygen Consumption ', ' Pathology ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Retina ', ' Retinal Diseases ', ' Retinal Disorder ', ' retina disease ', ' retina disorder ', ' retinopathy ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Structure-Activity Relationship ', ' chemical structure function ', ' structure function relationship ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Tissue Extracts ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Visual Fields ', ' eye field ', ' Measures ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' gangliocyte ', ' ganglion cell ', ' insight ', ' Visible Light ', ' Visible Light Radiation ', ' Visible Radiation ', ' Measurement ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Metabolic ', ' tool ', ' instrument ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Scanning ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' vision loss ', ' visual loss ', ' Blindness ', ' Width ', ' disease severity ', ' Severity of illness ', ' Oximetry ', ' Oxygen saturation measurement ', ' innovative technologies ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' cohort ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' Structure ', ' advanced illness ', ' advanced disease ', ' novel ', ' research study ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Modeling ', ' tissue oxygen saturation ', ' tissue oxygenation ', ' Doppler OCT ', ' OCT Tomography ', ' optical Doppler tomography ', ' optical coherence Doppler tomography ', ' Optical Coherence Tomography ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Inner Plexiform Layer ', ' Measurable ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Clinical Management ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' computerized ', ' macular ', ' macula ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' Imaging technology ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' RNFL ', ' retinal nerve fiber layer ', ' clinical practice ', ' math methodology ', ' math methods ', ' mathematical approach ', ' mathematical methodology ', ' mathematics approach ', ' mathematics methodology ', ' mathematics methods ', ' mathematical methods ', ' invention ', ' longitudinal data set ', ' longitudinal dataset ', ' preservation ', ' retina imaging ', ' retinal imaging ', ' ocular imaging ', ' deep learning ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NEI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,687519,NY-12,0.10461749855903234
"SCH: INT: Inferring at home gait parameters of older adults using floor vibrations   The United States population is growing older. There is an urgent need for tools to better connect health professionals with their patients and perform at-home assessments in an automated fashion. The long-term goal of this proposal is to discover the knowledge necessary to enable an always-on, non-intrusive, non-wearable smart system for automated at-home gait parameter estimation using floor vibrations. To achieve this vision, the proposal has the objective of connecting health professionals with older adults living independently through a smart system that estimates gait parameters using floor vibration. The aims to achieve this goal are to 1) determine at-home gait parameters as a function of time and space; 2) establish a digital identifier of the older adult based on gait parameters; and 3) correlate changes in at-home gait parameters, after considering spatial-temporal correlations, with changes in the well-being of the resident. The proposed research will advance the state-of-the-art in engineering, physical therapy and public health by testing the following hypotheses: 1) Floor vibration is a viable means to automatically and continuously determine gait parameters; 2) For healthy individuals living in an independent at-home setting, gait parameters will be consistent based on location in the home, time of the day and day of the week; and 3) For patients recently discharged from the hospital, recovery will correlate with improvements in their gait parameters. The testing of the hypotheses will be performed through five tasks: 1) Develop an automated system to capture floor vibration and extract gait parameters; 2) Validate the system in laboratory setting; 3) Collect data at participant’s homes; 4) Test the hypothesis that at-home gait parameters are consistent with time and space; 5) Test the hypothesis that improvement in gait parameters correlates improvement in health status of recently discharged patients. This research will be pursued by a group of interdisciplinary researchers in engineering and physical therapy with the support of an experienced geriatric physician and will advance the knowledge in signal processing techniques, estimation and validation of at-home gait parameters and their uncertainty, and relationship between changes at-home gait parameters and changes in health status. The proposed activities will have a significant impact on older adult care, the research community and the next generation of researchers and engineers stemming from: 1) improved health of older adults and reduced health care cost by early intervening and thus decreasing the readmission rate; 2) increased scientific literacy and public engagement through benchmark problems, interdisciplinary seminars, new courses and outreach activities; 3) the training of diverse convergence researchers competent in solving interdisciplinary problems, including underrepresented groups in STEM fields. The proposed research aligns with the mission of National Institute of Aging by developing automated, non-intrusive, privacy-preserving at-home gait assessment tools based on floor vibrations to correlate changes of gait parameters with the health status of older adults.

"Development of Multi-Compartment MR-Fingerprinting for Subvoxel Estimation of Quantitative Tissue Biomarkers Project Summary Magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF) has been proposed as a technique to quantify tissue parameters, such as T1 and T2 relaxation times, which are biomarkers for various pathologies. One assumption of MRF is that the signal in each voxel is generated by exactly one set of tissue parameters. Due to MRI resolution at the range of millimeter in combination with the cellular structure of biological tissue, each voxel consists of multiple tissue compartments. An over-simplified single compartment model results in apparent relaxation times that are influenced by the relaxation times and the fractional proton densities of all contributing compartments. This can lead to a misinterpretation of signal changes. For example, in diseases that causes demyelination in white matter (Multiple Sclerosis, Dementia), a reduction of the myelin water fraction would result in a misleading change of the apparent relaxation time of the voxel. We propose a multi-compartment MRF method that allows to identify multiple tissue contributions within a voxel, including the fractional proton density (PD) of different compartments. Our machine learning based approach automatically identifies the number of compartments within each voxel that can be identified with the available SNR in that voxel. We will correct for partial-volume effects at the borders of two types of tissues, as well as analyze tissue microstructure. For the second case our learned model will also include chemical exchange between compartments. After an initial validation phase using numerical simulations, we will first perform MRF scans of dedicated 3D printed phantoms with multiple compartments. Our quality criterion is successful estimation of all simulated tissue compartments for all voxels with a relative error of less than 5% to the ground truth. We will then perform in-vivo MRF measurements of healthy volunteers (n=5). We will generate synthetic FLAIR and MP-RAGE contrasts from parameter maps estimated with conventional and the proposed multi-compartment MRF technique. We will compare them with currently used clinical contrasts acquired using established pulse sequences and validate the performance of our approach by measuring the cortical thickness. Further, we will validate the performance for microstructure composition in white matter. Our hypothesis is that it will be possible separate the compartments for myelin, intra- and extra-cellular water and compare the results to ex-vivo data found in literature. In summary, the methods developed in this R21 proposal will provide a novel technique to accurately and reproducibly identify biomarkers beyond the resolution of a voxel. It will allow to identify changes in tissue composition and fractional proton density at the microstructure level. Project Narrative The overarching goal of this proposal is to establish a MR imaging technique for quantifying biomarkers at the sub-voxel level. We will develop a machine learning based MR fingerprinting image reconstruction that enables the identification and characterization of multiple compartments within a voxel in terms of fractional proton density and relaxation times. We will generate accurate synthetic fluid suppressed images such as the FLAIR and MP- RAGE with accurate partial volume behavior and analyze the myelin water fraction and the corresponding relaxation times in white matter.",Development of Multi-Compartment MR-Fingerprinting for Subvoxel Estimation of Quantitative Tissue Biomarkers,10016296,R21EB027241,"['Behavior ', ' Cerebrospinal Fluid ', ' cerebral spinal fluid ', ' spinal fluid ', ' Demyelinations ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Computer-Assisted Diagnosis ', ' Computer aided diagnosis ', ' computer-assisted diagnostics ', ' Dictionary ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Fingerprint ', ' Goals ', ' gray matter ', ' substantia grisea ', ' image reconstruction ', ' image construction ', ' image generation ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Multiple Sclerosis ', ' Disseminated Sclerosis ', ' insular sclerosis ', ' Myelin ', ' Noise ', ' Pathology ', ' Physics ', ' Protons ', ' H+ element ', ' Hydrogen Ions ', ' Relaxation ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Standardization ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Water ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Measures ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Chemicals ', ' Training ', ' soft tissue ', ' Measurement ', ' Cell Components ', ' Cell Structure ', ' Cellular Structures ', ' non-invasive diagnosis ', ' non-invasive diagnostic ', ' noninvasive diagnostic ', ' noninvasive diagnosis ', ' Multi-center studies ', ' Multicenter Studies ', ' fluid ', ' liquid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Pulse ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' millimeter ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Scanning ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Diseases ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural degenerative Disorders ', ' Neurodegenerative Diseases ', ' Neurologic Degenerative Conditions ', ' degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons ', ' degenerative neurological diseases ', ' neurodegenerative illness ', ' Neurodegenerative Disorders ', ' Performance ', ' Physical Phenomena or Properties ', ' physical process ', ' simulation ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' substantia alba ', ' white matter ', ' Modeling ', ' Magnetic Resonance ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Validation ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' reconstruction ', ' conditioning ', ' healthy volunteer ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' 3-D print ', ' 3-D printer ', ' 3D printer ', ' 3D printing ', ' three dimensional printing ', ' 3D Print ', ' imaging system ', ' tissue biomarkers ', ' MRI biomarker ', ' magnetic resonance imaging biomarker ', ' clinical translation ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep neural network ', ' ']",NIBIB,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R21,2020,252175,NY-12,0.0704646536883501
"A Quality Control Program for Quantitative MRI Data  Acquisition and Analysis in Multi-site Clinical Trials Project Summary/Abstract There has been a shift to greater use of neadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) in the clinical management of cancer. Often used in breast cancer to provide systemic treatment for possible or apparent metastatic disease, NACT also reduces the primary tumor size and facilitates breast conservation. Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (qMRI) is an effective diagnostic for monitoring tumor regression. There are many methodologies being developed for monitoring cancer in vivo, including contrast agent washout, volumetry, and more recently correlating apparent diffusion coefficients and proton relaxation times to tumor staging. Such imaging biomarkers are predictive of the pathological complete response (pCR) outcome prior to surgery. This enables physicians to provide “evidence based” treatment modifications to reduce deleterious side effects and improve patient outcomes. To obtain quantitative data from MR images, the variations that occur in imaging as a result of hardware and software differences between MRI manufacturers and day-to-day operations must be quantified. In MRI, the data depends on the protocols used to acquire the image, resulting in inconsistencies if even one parameter in the protocol changes. The goal of the proposed work is to produce and develop and disseminate a ground truth physical standard and quality control program for comparison of MRI scanners in the multisite I-SPY2 (ACRIN 6698) trials monitoring pre-operative chemotherapy treatments in the reduction of tumor size. The physical standard is an anthropomorphic breast phantom capable of fitting into all commercial breast coils. It contains novel human tissue mimics and geometric standards with values traceable to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Analysis software capable of protocol compliance checks, rapid identification of the regions of interest, and comparison to ground truth values as measured by NIST will be developed to complement the physical standard. This will enable qualification of sites and quantification of error resulting from scanner performance alone. Given the wide breadth of parameter space that MRI protocols encompass, part of the proposed effort will include the development of protocols specific to image acquisition of tumor volumes and for measuring the apparent diffusion coefficient within the tumor volumes as compared to surrounding healthy tissue. Project Narrative: Quantitative imaging complements precision medicine initiatives by providing a noninvasive method of monitoring gene specific in vivo treatment of diseases ranging from cancer to neurological disorders. To realize quantitative imaging, variations in imaging hardware, software, and procedures must be mitigated. This project will develop a quality assurance and quality control procedure for multisite clinical trials involved in monitoring therapeutic efficacy using MR breast imaging.",A Quality Control Program for Quantitative MRI Data  Acquisition and Analysis in Multi-site Clinical Trials,10018825,R44CA235820,"['Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Contrast Media ', ' Contrast Agent ', ' Contrast Drugs ', ' Radiopaque Media ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Diffusion ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Fats ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Head ', ' Institutes ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging ', ' Cancer Staging ', ' Neoplasm Staging ', ' Tumor Staging ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Production ', ' Protons ', ' H+ element ', ' Hydrogen Ions ', ' Quality Control ', ' Reading ', ' Relaxation ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Standardization ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Vendor ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' base ', ' quality assurance ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Site ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' human tissue ', ' Scanning ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Tumor Volume ', ' Protocol Compliance ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' interest ', ' magnetic ', ' Magnetism ', ' Performance ', ' complete response ', ' In complete remission ', ' Primary Tumor ', ' Primary Neoplasm ', ' novel ', ' Disease regression ', ' Reporting ', ' protocol development ', ' Manufacturer ', ' Manufacturer Name ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Multi-center clinical trial ', ' Multi-site clinical trial ', ' Multicenter clinical trial ', ' Multisite clinical trial ', ' Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial ', ' Reproducibility ', ' in vivo ', ' ACRIN ', ' American College of Radiology Imaging Network ', ' Clinical Management ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Pathologic ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Evidence based treatment ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' data acquisition ', ' chemotherapy ', ' noninvasive monitor ', ' non-invasive monitor ', ' tumor ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' treatment response ', ' operation ', ' computer assisted detection ', ' computer aided detection ', ' cloud based ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' precision medicine ', ' Precision Medicine Initiative ', ' predictive biomarkers ', ' predictive molecular biomarker ', ' predictive marker ', ' quantitative imaging ', ' mammary imaging ', ' breast imaging ', ' imaging marker ', ' imaging-based biological marker ', ' imaging-based biomarker ', ' imaging-based marker ', ' imaging biomarker ', ' Breast conservation ', ' Breast MRI ', ' Breast Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' deep learning ', ' side effect ', ' DICOM ', ' Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine ', ' smart algorithm ', ' intelligent algorithm ', ' ']",NCI,"CALIBERMRI, INC.",R44,2020,183388,CO-02,-0.0004973798628480515
"Toward a High Dimensional Computational Description of Variation in Human Decision-Making Across Psychiatric and Non-Psychiatric Populations TOWARD A HIGH DIMENSIONAL COMPUTATIONAL DESCRIPTION OF VARIATION IN HUMAN DECISION-MAKING ACROSS PSYCHIATRIC AND NON-PSYCHIATRIC POPULATIONS PI: Dr. John P. O'Doherty Institution: California Institute of Technology PROJECT SUMMARY  Computational psychiatry (CP) promises to gain deeper explanatory insight into psychiatric disorders through the application of formal computational models to task-related behavioral data and brain measures. However, research in CP to date has mostly involved a narrow unidimensional focus, utilizing either a relatively limited set of computational constructs such as simple model-free (MF) reinforcement learning (RL), and/or restricted to studying a specific task, a specific disease, or even a particular model parameter. For CP to reach its potential, we need to broaden the field's scope. To achieve this, it is necessary to develop an integrated theory and formal framework supported by a task battery that will enable the quantification of individual differences across a range of computational mechanisms pertinent to the diagnosis and treatment of clinical disorders. The objective of the current proposal is to implement the initial groundwork needed to build and test a computational framework and task battery that can facilitate a multi-dimensional computational description of individual variability in parameters relevant for characterizing psychiatric dysfunction.  We have constructed a computational assessment battery (CAB) consisting of four distinct yet inter- related tasks that move beyond simple RL to probe various aspects of learning, cognition, and decision-making. First, we assess learning about losses as well as rewards. Secondly, we measure model-based (MB) alongside simple MF learning and decision making, and the arbitration allocating control to either strategy. Thirdly, we examine strategies for solving the exploration/exploitation dilemma, in which individuals have to decide whether to exploit an option known to yield reward or explore an option whose outcomes are unknown. Finally, we assess social-learning, in which an individual can either infer the goals of another individual or simply imitate that agent's behavior.  We propose to build an integrated computational model that can capture relevant computations being implemented in each of the tasks in our battery, alongside a hierarchical model-fitting and parameter estimation framework to enable us to retrieve reliable parameter estimates for each computational variable of interest. We will leverage common computational mechanisms engaged across our task battery to improve estimability and generalizability. We will then acquire behavioral data in a large on-line (n=1000), and modest (n=100) in-lab sample on the CAB to establish the internal validity and test/re-test reliability of our computational model and parameter estimates. Finally, we will explore the relationship between model-estimated parameter estimates from behavior on our task battery and variability in self-reported traits and states relevant for psychiatric disease in our healthy samples, as well as in a pilot sample (n=60) of patients recruited from the UCLA psychiatry outpatient clinics. These efforts will form the basis of a Computational Psychiatry Toolbox for behavioral testing, model-fitting and parameter estimation that will eventually be released as a resource to the research community. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our goal is to develop a comprehensive approach to characterize an individual's ability to think, learn and make decisions in terms of a series of specific brain processes or `computations'. We then aim to determine whether variation in these computations can in turn be related to a variety of symptoms that can occur in psychiatric disorders. To achieve this, we will develop new mathematical and experimental tools to assess variation in behavior across individuals, and refine, test and validate these tools in a preliminary sample of healthy participants and psychiatric patients.",Toward a High Dimensional Computational Description of Variation in Human Decision-Making Across Psychiatric and Non-Psychiatric Populations,9989897,R21MH120805,"['Ambulatory Care Facilities ', ' Outpatient Clinics ', ' Anxiety ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' California ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Cognition ', ' Communities ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Institutes ', ' Learning ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Moods ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Patients ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Validity and Reliability ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rewards ', ' Supervision ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Measures ', ' Arbitrating ', ' Arbitration ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' psychiatric care ', ' psychiatric therapy ', ' psychiatric treatment ', ' Psychiatric therapeutic procedure ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Undifferentiated ', ' Ensure ', ' insight ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' participant recruitment ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Functional disorder ', ' tool ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' trait ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' behavioral test ', ' behavior test ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Institution ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' trial regimen ', ' trial treatment ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' computational framework ', ' computer framework ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Individual Differences ', ' computer algorithm ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' large scale simulation ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapy ', ' targeted treatment ', ' social learning ', ' high dimensionality ', ' recruit ', ' individual heterogeneity ', ' individual variability ', ' individual variation ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' Computer Models ', ' ']",NIMH,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R21,2020,204080,CA-27,0.11221055407047963
"Motion-Resolved, Comprehensive Quantitative Tissue Characterization Using MR Multitasking PROJECT SUMMARY  Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures tissue parameters such as T1, T2, T2*, and diffusion to detect subtle differences in tissue states (such as microstructure, diffuse fibrosis, edema, hemorrhage, and iron content) from neurological, oncological, and cardiovascular diseases. Because each parameter offers complementary tissue information, multiparameter mapping is very promising for risk assessment, early detection, accurate staging, and treatment monitoring of disease. However, quantitative MRI is typically very time consuming and difficult to perform. Each parameter is typically measured from its own series of images, so measuring multiple parameters leads to long, inefficient scanning sessions. Furthermore, cardiac and breathing motion creates misalignment between images, causing additional problems.  The standard approach to motion is to either remove it (e.g., ask the patient to hold their breath) or to synchronize image acquisition with it (e.g., using electrocardiography (ECG) to monitor cardiac motion). This approach makes scan times even longer, limits imaging to patients who can repeatedly perform long breath holds (which is difficult for aging or weak patients) and who have predictable cardiac motion (which is not true of patients with cardiac arrhythmias). Furthermore, these methods are often unreliable and difficult to perform.  This project is to develop and validate a new technology, MR Multitasking, to perform multiple simultaneous measurements in a single, push-button scan that is both comfortable for patients and simple for technologists to perform. MR Multitasking redesigns quantitative MRI around the concept of images as functions of many time dimensions, each corresponding to a different dynamic process (e.g., motion, T1, T2, T2*, and diffusion), and then uses mathematical models called low-rank tensors to perform fast, multidimensional imaging. This allows continuous acquisition of imaging data even while the subject is moving, providing motion-resolved parameter maps without breath holding or motion synchronization. We will scan healthy subjects, liver patients, prostate cancer patients, and cardiovascular patients to develop and validate this technology and use artificial intelligence to quickly reconstruct images from the collected data. The resulting tool will be applicable to any organ system, offering clinicians and investigators a valuable tool to answer a wide range of biomedical questions. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This project is to develop and validate a one-stop, push-button solution for comprehensive, motion- resolved quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This will be accomplished by cultivating a new technology, MR Multitasking, which can measure multiple tissue biomarkers in a single scan, even in moving organs. The resulting technology will be applicable to any organ system, offering clinicians and investigators a valuable tool to diagnose, monitor, and study a wide range of diseases.","Motion-Resolved, Comprehensive Quantitative Tissue Characterization Using MR Multitasking",9886248,R01EB028146,"['Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' Arrhythmia ', ' Cardiac Arrhythmia ', ' Heart Arrhythmias ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Breathing ', ' Respiratory Aspiration ', ' Respiratory Inspiration ', ' inspiration ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diffusion ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Edema ', ' Dropsy ', ' Hydrops ', ' Electrocardiogram ', ' ECG ', ' EKG ', ' Electrocardiography ', ' Fibrosis ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Bleeding ', ' blood loss ', ' image reconstruction ', ' image construction ', ' image generation ', ' Joints ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Lipids ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic body system ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Motion ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Respiration ', ' respiratory mechanism ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Measures ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Organ ', ' Clinical ', ' Diffuse ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Series ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Blood flow ', ' Recovery ', ' Measurement ', ' Fe element ', ' Iron ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Dimensions ', ' Scanning ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Organ System ', ' body system ', ' respiratory ', ' magnetic ', ' Magnetism ', ' magnetic field ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' cardiac motion ', ' heart motion ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematic model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematical model ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Collection ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Cardiac ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' reconstruction ', ' time use ', ' prospective ', ' Consumption ', ' multi-task ', ' multitask ', ' quantitative imaging ', ' magnetohydrodynamic ', ' tissue biomarkers ', ' Tissue imaging ', ' deep learning ', ' ']",NIBIB,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,628575,CA-28,0.0783589904040105
