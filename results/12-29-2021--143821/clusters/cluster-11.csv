"mHealth intervention for ART adherence and sexual risk reduction among HIV+ YMSM     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The candidate is an adolescent medicine specialist and Director of Adolescent HIV Services at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia with a research focus on using mobile technology to improve adherence and other health outcomes for adolescents at risk for and living with HIV/AIDS. The candidate proposes a career development program that will provide her with the skills and experience to become an independent investigator in the field of adolescent HIV research. In addition to didactic coursework in quantitative and qualitative research methodology and health behavior theory, the candidate's career development will be guided by a multidisciplinary team of nationally recognized advisors committed to her success. [She will form a Technology Advisory Board for mentorship and preceptorships in all aspects of mobile health (mHealth) technology, including incubation and development of technology-based health interventions, study design and analysis techniques for big data/machine learning, gamification theory, user interface/responsive design techniques, usability testing, and the application of health behavior theory to develop mHealth interventions.] Career development activities will be complemented by practical experience gained through the conduct of original research. This proposal examines key health behaviors of medication adherence and sexual risk among young men who have sex with men (YMSM) living with HIV/AIDS, and proposes to develop a mobile phone based intervention targeted at improving these health behaviors in the real times and places youth need support. AIM 1 will describe the incidence of STI co-infections and virologic failure and report the standardized risk of these outcomes across strata of HIV+ YMSM through retrospective chart review augmented by in-depth structured interviews for further understanding of key psychosocial and behavioral factors. Using focus groups of youth at high- and low-risk, selected based on findings from AIM 1, AIM 2 will explore how HIV+ YMSM use mobile technology, and their attitudes towards various mobile phone-based tools to improve adherence and reduce sexual risk. Delphi methodology will first be used in AIM 3 to convene a panel of mHealth and adolescent health experts to establish consensus guidelines for adolescent sexual health technology-based intervention development. These results, combined with youth input from AIM 2, will serve as a guiding framework for development of a new mHealth secondary prevention intervention for HIV+ YMSM. The new mHealth intervention composed of theory-driven elements, for example, including time and location-based reminders, and individual and group-based gaming incentives will then undergo usability testing consisting of (a) a focus group for specific feedback on design and user experience and then (b) a 12-month feasibility trial where 20 youth will have the application installed and usage, satisfaction, and clinical outcome data will be collected. In line with NIMH's research priorities, this proposal sets out to develop an innovative secondary prevention strategy targeting improved medication adherence and sexual risk reduction among HIV+ YMSM.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed mentored award supports the career development of the candidate into an independent patient- oriented researcher focused on improving the health of adolescents living with and at-risk for HIV/AIDS. The project aims to develop a new secondary prevention intervention, using mobile phone-based technologies, for HIV+ young men who have sex with men (YMSM), targeting key behaviors of sexual risk-taking and poor medication adherence. This research is highly relevant to public health as it targets improving health outcomes of HIV+ youth and preventing new infections among YMSM who are most disproportionately affected by the HIV

"Improving Adherence and Outcomes by Artificial Intelligence-Adapted Text Messages     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Uncontrolled hypertension is a major cause of morbidity and mortality and many patients fail to take their antihypertensive medication as prescribed. We propose to use artificial intelligence (AI) to allow short message service (SMS or text messages) interventions to adapt to patients' adherence needs and substantially improve medication taking. The aims of the study are to: (1) develop AI methods for adaptive decision-making in human- centered environments and demonstrate the feasibility of the resulting AI-enhanced SMS medication adherence intervention, (2) demonstrate that the intervention can ""learn"" by adapting the SMS message stream according to patients' medication taking over time, and (3) examine potential intervention impact as measured by improvements in medication adherence and systolic blood pressures. We will recruit 100 patients with uncontrolled hypertension and antihypertensive medication non-adherence. Adherence and other covariates will be measured via surveys at baseline, 3- and 6 months; blood pressures will be measured at baseline and 6 months. Participants will be given an electronic pill-bottle adherence monitor. Participants will receive SMS messages designed to motivate antihypertensive medication adherence. Message content and frequency will adapt automatically using AI algorithms designed to automatically optimize expected pill bottle opening. For Aim 1, the first 25 patients will be enrolled to develop and test alternative RL algorithms and fine-tune the system parameters. For Aim 2, we will examine changes in the probability distribution over message-types and compare that distribution with patients' reasons for non-adherence reported at baseline. For Aim 3, we will examine changes in self-reported medication non-adherence and blood pressure and automatically-reported pill bottle openings. This pilot study will establish the feasibility and potential impact of this novel approach to mobile health messaging for self-management support. The results will be used to support an R01 application for a larger and more definitive trial of intervention impacts.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Uncontrolled high blood pressure is a major cause of death and illness and many patients fail to take their blood pressure medications as prescribed. We propose to use an artificial intelligence (AI) computer system to send different types of text messages to patients. These messages will change over time to meet patients' adherence needs and improve medication taking and blood pressure.            ",Improving Adherence and Outcomes by Artificial Intelligence-Adapted Text Messages,8701773,R21HS022336,[''],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R21,2014,140561,MI-12,0.2510591380354978

"DOT Diary (D2): Developing a mobile app with combined automated DOT and daily sexual diary for monitoring and improving PrEP adherence ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Several efficacy trials of pre-exposure prophylaxis (daily antiretroviral therapy to prevent HIV acquisition in uninfected persons with sexual exposures) have failed because of poor adherence to medications. To ensure accurate, longitudinal measurement of pill ingestion with real-time monitoring, we plan to develop DOT Diary (D2), a smartphone application that uses artificial intelligence for measuring pill taking using Directly Observed Therapy. This patented technology will be combined with a daily sexual diary for use in future PrEP observational and efficacy trials. Such an approach provides aggregated data for individual participants, study sites, and trials overall, that facilitates realtime feedback to maximize adherence. We plan a 3 stage process for building and evaluating D2. First, we will assess the assess the reliability and validity of the automated DOT tool to identify attempts to ""cheat"" and over-report pill taking, as well as to evaluate the sensitivity of the measure to detecting 1- to 3-week interruptions in pill use. Second, we will develop and optimize the feasibility and acceptability of D2 for participants and study staff in tracking participation ver time, and providing real-time adherence feedback to study participants. Lastly, we will run a 24-week pilot study of D2 for high-risk men who have sex with men to evaluate the plausibility that this tool can be successfully used to measure and optimize adherence in future PrEP trials.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many studies of pre-exposure prophylaxis or PrEP (giving an anti-HIV medication to an HIV uninfected person to prevent infection from their HIV positive sex partner) have failed to tell us whether or not the medication prevents infection, because very few of the study volunteers took the pills regularly.

Using focus groups of youth at high- and low-risk, selected based on findings from AIM 1, AIM 2 will explore how HIV+ YMSM use mobile technology, and their attitudes towards various mobile phone-based tools to improve adherence and reduce sexual risk. Delphi methodology will first be used in AIM 3 to convene a panel of mHealth and adolescent health experts to establish consensus guidelines for adolescent sexual health technology-based intervention development. These results, combined with youth input from AIM 2, will serve as a guiding framework for development of a new mHealth secondary prevention intervention for HIV+ YMSM. The new mHealth intervention composed of theory-driven elements, for example, including time and location-based reminders, and individual and group-based gaming incentives will then undergo usability testing consisting of (a) a focus group for specific feedback on design and user experience and then (b) a 12-month feasibility trial where 20 youth will have the application installed and usage, satisfaction, and clinical outcome data will be collected. In line with NIMH's research priorities, this proposal sets out to develop an innovative secondary prevention strategy targeting improved medication adherence and sexual risk reduction among HIV+ YMSM. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed mentored award supports the career development of the candidate into an independent patient- oriented researcher focused on improving the health of adolescents living with and at-risk for HIV/AIDS. The project aims to develop a new secondary prevention intervention, using mobile phone-based technologies, for HIV+ young men who have sex with men (YMSM), targeting key behaviors of sexual risk-taking and poor medication adherence. This research is highly relevant to public health as it targets improving health outcomes of HIV+ youth and preventing new infections among YMSM who are most disproportionately affected by the HIV epidemic in the US.",mHealth intervention for ART adherence and sexual risk reduction among HIV+ YMSM,9111981,K23MH102128,"['Adolescent Medicine ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Attitude ', ' Award ', '

"DOT Diary (D2): Developing a mobile app with combined automated DOT and daily sexual diary for monitoring and improving PrEP adherence ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Several efficacy trials of pre-exposure prophylaxis (daily antiretroviral therapy to prevent HIV acquisition in uninfected persons with sexual exposures) have failed because of poor adherence to medications. To ensure accurate, longitudinal measurement of pill ingestion with real-time monitoring, we plan to develop DOT Diary (D2), a smartphone application that uses artificial intelligence for measuring pill taking using Directly Observed Therapy. This patented technology will be combined with a daily sexual diary for use in future PrEP observational and efficacy trials. Such an approach provides aggregated data for individual participants, study sites, and trials overall, that facilitates realtime feedback to maximize adherence. We plan a 3 stage process for building and evaluating D2. First, we will assess the assess the reliability and validity of the automated DOT tool to identify attempts to ""cheat"" and over-report pill taking, as well as to evaluate the sensitivity of the measure to detecting 1- to 3-week interruptions in pill use. Second, we will develop and optimize the feasibility and acceptability of D2 for participants and study staff in tracking participation ver time, and providing real-time adherence feedback to study participants. Lastly, we will run a 24-week pilot study of D2 for high-risk men who have sex with men to evaluate the plausibility that this tool can be successfully used to measure and optimize adherence in future PrEP trials. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many studies of pre-exposure prophylaxis or PrEP (giving an anti-HIV medication to an HIV uninfected person to prevent infection from their HIV positive sex partner) have failed to tell us whether or not the medication prevents infection, because very few of the study volunteers took the pills regularly. We will be developing and testing a new technology called DOT Diary (D2) that will be used by PrEP study volunteers to take pictures (using their smartphones) of themselves taking their pills, and also using their phones to keep track of their sexual practices. This will allow future studies to provide extra support for study volunteers not taking their medicines regularly, and to figure out whether or not the medications prevent new HIV infections.",DOT Diary (D2): Developing a mobile app with combined automated DOT and daily sexual diary for monitoring and improving PrEP adherence,9325111,R01MH109320,"['Accounting ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Behavior ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Color ', ' Aggregated Data ', ' Data Aggregation ', ' Data Collection ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Feedback ', ' Fumarates ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Medicine ', ' Persons ', ' Patents ', ' Legal patent ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacokinetics ', ' Drug Kinetics ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Recommendation ', ' Validity and Reliability ', ' Risk ', ' Running ', ' San Francisco ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Measures ', ' Injectable ', ' Schedule ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' improved ', ' Prophylaxis ', ' Prophylactic treatment ', ' Site ', ' Biological ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Ingestion ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Spottings ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' diaries ', ' programs ', ' Viread ', ' Tenofovir ', ' Frequencies ', ' Oral ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' Prevent infection ', ' Infection prevention ', ' meetings ', ' Performance ', ' forgetting ', ' antiretroviral ', ' anti-retroviral ', ' Antiretroviral Agents ', ' Anti-Retroviral Agents ', ' Participant ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Reporting ', ' Directly Observed Therapy ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', "" beta-L-2',3'-dideoxy-5-fluoro-3'-thiacytidine "", ' emtricitabine ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' pill ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Dose ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Interruption ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' sex risk ', ' cost ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' efficacy trial ', ' volunteer ', ' tuberculosis treatment ', ' tuberculosis therapy ', ' TB treatment ', ' TB therapy ', ' high risk ', ' FDA approved ', ' treatment adherence ', ' comparative efficacy ', ' compare efficacy ', ' Regimen ', ' young man ', ' adolescent men ', ' adolescent man ', ' mobile application ', ' mobile app ', ' temporal measurement ', ' time measurement ', ' temporal resolution ', ' dashboard ', ' ']",NIMH,PUBLIC HEALTH FOUNDATION ENTERPRISES,R01,2016,184571,CA-32,0.1706983562887976
"mHealth for Heart Failure: Predictive Models of Readmission Risk and Self-care Using Consumer Activity Trackers PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Heart failure (HF) is a debilitating disease that affects over five million people in the United States. Occurrence of, morbidity related to, and hospitalization due to HF have serious financial implications. In 2009, HF had a direct cost of over $34 billion annually, the majority of which was due to hospitalizations. By 2030, HF total direct costs are predicted to reach $53 billion, and indirect costs are predicted to rise from $31 billion to $70 billion. Increases in costs are contingent on the increase in the aging population, making prevention of HF and care efficiency imperative. Fifty percent of readmissions due to HF are preventable, with lack of adherence to prescribed self-care as the driving factor. Results of telemedicine intervention studies to support adherence to self-care and improve HF outcomes are inconclusive. Past telemedicine interventions for HF have utilized an array of methods including: wireless sensors, telephone services, websites, and home visits from nurses. Structured telephone support has shown in some cases to reduce hospitalization, improve clinical outcomes, and reduce all-cause mortality in HF patients. However, patient adherence to telemedicine interventions is often low. This lack of adherence is due in part to the high treatment burden placed upon patients in such home monitoring interventions, which require them to engage in novel behaviors, including using new unfamiliar hardware and spending time meeting with home health nurses. The goal of this R01 is to demonstrate the following: 1) patients are more adherent with a home monitoring regimen when using minimally-invasive monitoring technologies, including wrist-worn consumer activity trackers; 2) a minimally-invasive home monitoring regimen combined with novel predictive algorithms may be used to forecast hospital readmission; and 3) data from the electronic health record (EHR) and a baseline survey may be used to predict levels of adherence to the home monitoring regimen. Towards these goals, we will recruit 500 HF patients to participate in a minimally-invasive home monitoring regimen. A novel mobile application will allow patients to monitor their progress, submit additional data, and receive adherence notifications. We will measure levels of adherence to the regimen, and use collected sensor data and known readmission events to create a novel hidden semi-Markov model that continuously predicts readmission risk. Predicting a patient's level of adherence will be performed with EHR data and a baseline survey using several techniques, including logistic regression and support vector machine models. The work outlined in this proposal will produce a set of foundational tools for performing home monitoring of HF patients. These tools will be adaptable for future studies of individually-tailored interventions, towards our ultimate goal of allowing patients to download an “app” from an “app store” that adapts to their individual characteristics and allows them to more effectively manage their disease.

"Tailored Drug Titration through Artificial Intelligence Optima Integrated Health Inc. (Optima) proposes to demonstrate the clinical efficacy of the decision support technology for medication treatment optimization it validated in a pilot clinical trial, optima4BP. optima4BP is designed as a physician decision/action support aid in timely and safely optimizing medication treatment independent of in-office visits, for patients with uncontrolled hypertension (HTN). optima4BP is designed to reduce preventable hospitalizations and the associated incidence of stroke, heart failure (HF) or myocardial infarction (MI) events resulting from high blood pressure (BP) above goal. Uncontrolled HTN affects 34 million Americans. The cost of HTN-associated hospitalizations is $113 billion, or 15% of all hospital costs, with >135 million Emergency Dptm. (ED) visits. optima4BP will improve the quality of life for uncontrolled HTN patients, and reduce this massive burden on the US healthcare system. Our long term objective is to help drive the transformation from the reactive pay-for-service healthcare paradigm to one that emphasizes preventative care through personalized health surveillance, assessment, and action via timely and safely optimized medication treatment. Our specific aims include: Aim (1) demonstrating the efficacy of optima4BP in a randomized clinical trial (n=300 patients) deployed at UC San Francisco Medical Center. Patients will be randomized to an enhanced care (EC) arm or an optima4BP arm (O4BP). All patients will use Omron10 BP arm cuff to remotely measure their BP. For the patients in the EC arm, physicians will be provided with a monthly summary of the Omron10 data. For patients in the O4BP arm, aside from the BP monthly summary, physicians will receive (a) a risk stratified patient roster, (b) next step actions in medication optimization for each patient, and (c) access to optima4BP's secure web-service medication treatment modeling to investigate how changing current patient data could affect medication choice (e.g., change in medication choice if BP goal is lowered). We will then examine the BP value reduction between arms (success:>7 mmHg decreased systolic; >4 mmHg decreased diastolic of O4BP vs. EC), along with secondary outcomes between O4BP and EC: medication treatment action frequency; ED admissions due to HTN-related symptoms and associated hospitalizations for stroke, HF or MI; and overall cost of HTN management. Aim (2) optima4BP data processing steps will be optimized to scale-up its capability to >1000/day patient cases processing power. 3 specific optimization processing tools will be developed: Optima Extract, Transform, and Load (OETL); Optima Survey Generator (OSG), and Optima Message Builder (OMB). OETL will provide streamlined scheduling logic to extracting data from Epic® EMR (electronic medical record), optimize data mapping scripts within optima4BP, and optimize data uploading protocols. OSG will optimize the current generation protocol for patient surveys, patient response, and assignment of patient responses to specific processing modules. OMB will ensure streamlined scheduling of risk stratification updates and scheduled delivery to physician In-Basket messaging system within Epic® EHR. Our goal is to simplify the management of high blood pressure (BP) while improving the quality of care of patients and reducing the associated costs. We will investigate the benefits of a novel surveillance- assessment-medication treatment action artificial intelligence (optima4BP) as a physician decision support aid in timely and safely optimizing medication treatment independent of in-office visits, with the goal of reducing preventable hospitalizations and the associated incidence of stroke, heart failure or heart attack events.",Tailored Drug Titration through Artificial Intelligence,9341533,R44HL132622,"['Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Emergencies ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heart failure ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Allergy ', ' Hypersensitivity ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Incidence ', ' Intelligence ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Laboratories ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Logic ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' heart infarction ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart attack ', ' coronary infarction ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Office Visits ', ' physician office visit ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Risk ', ' San Francisco ', ' stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Gender ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Businesses ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Schedule ', ' Caring ', ' Custom ', ' Titrations ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Hospital Costs ', ' Ensure ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' tool ', ' Frequencies ', ' Event ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' System ', ' Visit ', ' Medical center ', ' innovative technologies ', ' American ', ' success ', ' Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ', ' United States Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ', ' Public Law 104-191 ', ' PL104-191 ', ' PL 104-191 ', ' Kennedy Kassebaum Act ', ' HIPAA ', ' blood pressure regulation ', ' regulate blood pressure ', ' regulate BP ', ' blood pressure management ', ' blood pressure homeostasis ', ' blood pressure control ', ' BP regulation ', ' BP management ', ' BP homeostasis ', ' BP control ', ' novel ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' Modeling ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' response ', ' Adverse effects ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' computerized data processing ', ' data processing ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Update ', ' medication adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' web-based service ', ' web services ', ' cost ', ' hypertension treatment ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' clinical efficacy ', ' scale up ', ' commercial application ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' Secure ', ' arm ', ' cloud based ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' health data ', ' blood pressure reduction ', ' reduction in blood pressure ', ' reduction in BP ', ' reduce blood pressure ', ' reduce BP ', ' lowers blood pressure ', ' lower blood pressure ', ' lower BP ', ' BP reduction ', ' patient stratification ', ' stratified patient ', ' Preventive care ', ' Preventative care ', ' health care service ', ' healthcare service ', ' Risk stratification ', ' ']",NHLBI,"OPTIMA INTEGRATED HEALTH, INC.",R44,2017,849047,CA-12,0.10628987894684383
"Detecting and Monitoring Tardive Dyskinesia to Improve Patient Outcomes Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a common debilitating side effect of antipsychotic use. Characterized most notably by involuntary facial movements such as grimacing, involuntary lip, mouth, and tongue movements, and eye blinking, TD is difficult to treat and potentially irreversible. Psychiatrists and other mental health professionals are acutely aware of the impairment and disability experienced by patients who develop TD. Early detection of TD is critical so that appropriate interventions can be instituted. Unfortunately, despite professionals’ best efforts, it is often too late in the process and the involuntary movements are permanent. Antipsychotic prescriptions exceeded 50 million in 2011 and the reported incidence of TD is between 13% and 24%. Risk grows with advancing age, off-label uses, and chronic exposure to antipsychotics. Therefore, prevention and early detection are key to managing TD. However, current methods for monitoring patients require observation of patients at infrequent in-person visits or self-reporting by vigilant patients and their families. Therefore strong market potential exists for an automated detection system. This Phase I project proposes to leverage existing telepsychiatry and video interview data gathering technologies available commercially to efficiently collect and analyze two hundred 5-minute video interviews with individuals taking anti-psychotic medications. Half of the interviews will be with individuals living with diagnosed TD and the other without a diagnosis of TD. The participants in the study will be recruited to ensure an equal distribution of females and males as well as an ethnically and racially representative sample. The proposed data gathering strategy will provide the source material necessary to create a powerful supervised machine learning derived video and audio analysis tool to detect TD. The detection tool will be created using 80% of the collected video data as a training set and validated on the remaining 20% reserved as the control set. Based on industry experience with other supervised machine learning training sets and the amount of data to be collected, we set a goal of a 90% success rate in identifying TD positive and TD negative participants in the control set. Once the detection tool is complete the project will conclude by incorporating access to the tool into an existing smartphone app, iRxReminder, that is used for data gathering and monitoring of clinical trials. The iRxReminder system links patients directly to researchers and their electronic records. The modified app will be tested in the laboratory to ensure the interface can be easily used. In Phase II the iRxReminder system will be validated for use in supporting the self-management and symptom monitoring of medication taking by individuals living with chronic mental illnesses. Once feasibility is established, we propose a year-long RCT where participants will be monitored for early detection of TD along with goals for high adherence, improved control of symptoms and side effects, and more aggressive and frequent treatment responses by the healthcare team. A recent study reported that TD rates among newly treated elderly ranged from 7.2% for those taking Risperidone to 11.1% for those taking olanzapine after 2 years of treatment. Earlier meta-analyses estimate TD frequency in women to be 26.6% and in men 21.6%. Ethnically Chinese and Malaysian mental health patients were studied in Singapore and patients taking anti-psychotic medications were found to have TD in 40% and 29% of cases respectively. Regardless of prevalence, TD is a threat to patient adherence and quality of life. TD only remits in a minority of cases and can be permanent. With 50 million prescriptions for anti-psychotics written annually, more than 10 million persons living with a chronic mental illness are at risk of developing TD. There are likely over 6 million patients living with TD and the number of patients with TD is expected to grow with the aging population and increasing off- label use of antipsychotics. ",Detecting

"DOT Diary (D2): Developing a mobile app with combined automated DOT and daily sexual diary for monitoring and improving PrEP adherence ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Several efficacy trials of pre-exposure prophylaxis (daily antiretroviral therapy to prevent HIV acquisition in uninfected persons with sexual exposures) have failed because of poor adherence to medications. To ensure accurate, longitudinal measurement of pill ingestion with real-time monitoring, we plan to develop DOT Diary (D2), a smartphone application that uses artificial intelligence for measuring pill taking using Directly Observed Therapy. This patented technology will be combined with a daily sexual diary for use in future PrEP observational and efficacy trials. Such an approach provides aggregated data for individual participants, study sites, and trials overall, that facilitates realtime feedback to maximize adherence. We plan a 3 stage process for building and evaluating D2. First, we will assess the assess the reliability and validity of the automated DOT tool to identify attempts to ""cheat"" and over-report pill taking, as well as to evaluate the sensitivity of the measure to detecting 1- to 3-week interruptions in pill use. Second, we will develop and optimize the feasibility and acceptability of D2 for participants and study staff in tracking participation ver time, and providing real-time adherence feedback to study participants. Lastly, we will run a 24-week pilot study of D2 for high-risk men who have sex with men to evaluate the plausibility that this tool can be successfully used to measure and optimize adherence in future PrEP trials. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many studies of pre-exposure prophylaxis or PrEP (giving an anti-HIV medication to an HIV uninfected person to prevent infection from their HIV positive sex partner) have failed to tell us whether or not the medication prevents infection, because very few of the study volunteers took the pills regularly. We will be developing and testing a new technology called DOT Diary (D2) that will be used by PrEP study volunteers to take pictures (using their smartphones) of themselves taking their pills, and also using their phones to keep track of their sexual practices. This will allow future studies to provide extra support for study volunteers not taking their medicines regularly, and to figure out whether or not the medications prevent new HIV infections.",DOT Diary (D2): Developing a mobile app with combined automated DOT and daily sexual diary for monitoring and improving PrEP adherence,9319810,R01MH109320,"['Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Behavior ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Color ', ' Aggregated Data ', ' Data Aggregation ', ' Data Collection ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Feedback ', ' Fumarates ', ' Future ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Medicine ', ' Persons ', ' Legal patent ', ' Patents ', ' Patients ', ' Drug Kinetics ', ' Pharmacokinetics ', ' Phonation ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Recommendation ', ' Validity and Reliability ', ' Risk ', ' Running ', ' San Francisco ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' sex partner ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Measures ', ' Injectable ', ' Schedule ', ' Custom ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Biological ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Ingestion ', ' Individual ', ' Logistics ', ' Measurement ', ' Spottings ', ' tool ', ' diaries ', ' programs ', ' Tenofovir ', ' Viread ', ' Frequencies ', ' Oral ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Pattern ', ' Infection prevention ', ' Prevent infection ', ' Performance ', ' forgetting ', ' Anti-Retroviral Agents ', ' antiretroviral ', ' anti-retroviral ', ' Antiretroviral Agents ', ' Participant ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' Reporting ', ' Directly Observed Therapy ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' emtricitabine ', "" beta-L-2',3'-dideoxy-5-fluoro-3'-thiacytidine "", ' HIV diagnosis ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' pill ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Effectiveness ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Dose ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Interruption ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' sex risk ', ' cost ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' efficacy trial ', ' high risk men ', ' men at high risk ', ' volunteer ', ' tuberculosis treatment ', ' tuberculosis therapy ', ' TB treatment ', ' TB therapy ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' FDA approved ', ' treatment adherence ', ' comparative efficacy ', ' compare efficacy ', ' Regimen ', ' young man ', ' adolescent men ', ' adolescent man ', ' mobile application ', ' mobile app ', ' young men who have sex with men ', ' young MSM ', ' YMSM ', ' dashboard ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' PrEP ', ' ']",NIMH,PUBLIC HEALTH FOUNDATION ENTERPRISES,R01,2017,992570,CA-32,0.1706983562887976
"Telehealth Intervention for Improved Blood Pressure Control with Targeted Incentives: Using New Technologies and Insights From Behavioral Economics to Increase the Effectiveness of Behavioral Change PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Hypertension, or sustained systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) of 140 and 90 mm Hg or higher, is among the most frequently encountered conditions in primary care in the U.S. The estimated prevalence is 30% among all U.S. adults and increases with age to affect 65% of seniors. Hypertension is also the leading risk factor for cardiovascular disease, global mortality, and ranks third among the causes of disability. Treatment of hypertension is relatively straightforward, but patient adherence to long- term self-care strategies is problematically low. Three important behaviors that individuals can adhere to in order to help lower their BP are 1) Taking medications as prescribed by a physician, 2) Monitoring blood pressure at home, and 3) Limiting dietary sodium intake. Adherence to these behaviors is problematic and currently ranges from 25% to 50%; the current proposal is aimed at addressing the behavioral barriers for these three activities with the help of new technology. In particular, this STTR will develop and test an incentive program delivered through a telehealth app to increase adherence to prescribed BP control regimens, and precipitate reduction in BP. The target participants for the test are a vulnerable population of seniors with clinically diagnosed hypertension in the University of California - San Diego community. The product to be developed through this STTR is a telehealth app for patient smartphones, which incorporates financial and targeted incentives framed in a way that targets specific “mental accounts” to maximize the behavioral effectiveness of the intervention. The approach is to (1) Using focus group to construct an optimal incentive strategy to promote adherence to overcome behavioral barriers, support self-efficacy, and complement intrinsic motivators, and (2) Demonstrate feasibility of combining behavioral economics with state-of-the-art telehealth technology to deliver an optimal incentive strategy to the specific group of patients to promote adherence and reduce BP. The telehealth innovation centers on (a) Immediate delivery of reminder triggers and reinforcement to establish behaviors, (b) Employment of computer vision and artificial intelligence technologies to reduce time and effort costs of adherence, and finally (c) Support for remote monitoring of patient progress by health plans, providers and researchers. Phase II will test the efficacy of this approach in a larger and more diverse population within the UCSD Health system, additionally incorporating incentives for outcomes (e.g., achievement of BP < 140/90 mm Hg) to search for statistically and clinically significant improvements in blood pressure resulting from use of the app with the optimal incentives. Initial customers are health insurers and risk-bearing hospital systems (e.g. those with value-based reimbursement models), who are fiscally responsible for large numbers of patients with poorly controlled BP. PROJECT NARRATIVE/PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Nonadherence to treatment for high blood pressure in the aging population is an urgent public health concern that impacts individuals, families, and communities across the nation. The resulting health problems, including cardiovascular disease, heart attack, stroke, and death, and excessive spending, can be relieved through enhanced remote support for behavioral change using low-cost, scalable, and widely accessible telehealth tools, such as the product of this STTR. This approach has the potential to become widely adopted by health plans and providers that care for millions of seniors with poorly controlled hypertension to help these populations avoid complications and achieve better their health, as well as contribute to a better understanding of human behaviors and their impact on medical conditions.",Telehealth Intervention for Improved Blood

"mHealth intervention for ART adherence and sexual risk reduction among HIV+ YMSM DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The candidate is an adolescent medicine specialist and Director of Adolescent HIV Services at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia with a research focus on using mobile technology to improve adherence and other health outcomes for adolescents at risk for and living with HIV/AIDS. The candidate proposes a career development program that will provide her with the skills and experience to become an independent investigator in the field of adolescent HIV research. In addition to didactic coursework in quantitative and qualitative research methodology and health behavior theory, the candidate's career development will be guided by a multidisciplinary team of nationally recognized advisors committed to her success. [She will form a Technology Advisory Board for mentorship and preceptorships in all aspects of mobile health (mHealth) technology, including incubation and development of technology-based health interventions, study design and analysis techniques for big data/machine learning, gamification theory, user interface/responsive design techniques, usability testing, and the application of health behavior theory to develop mHealth interventions.] Career development activities will be complemented by practical experience gained through the conduct of original research. This proposal examines key health behaviors of medication adherence and sexual risk among young men who have sex with men (YMSM) living with HIV/AIDS, and proposes to develop a mobile phone based intervention targeted at improving these health behaviors in the real times and places youth need support. AIM 1 will describe the incidence of STI co-infections and virologic failure and report the standardized risk of these outcomes across strata of HIV+ YMSM through retrospective chart review augmented by in-depth structured interviews for further understanding of key psychosocial and behavioral factors. Using focus groups of youth at high- and low-risk, selected based on findings from AIM 1, AIM 2 will explore how HIV+ YMSM use mobile technology, and their attitudes towards various mobile phone-based tools to improve adherence and reduce sexual risk. Delphi methodology will first be used in AIM 3 to convene a panel of mHealth and adolescent health experts to establish consensus guidelines for adolescent sexual health technology-based intervention development. These results, combined with youth input from AIM 2, will serve as a guiding framework for development of a new mHealth secondary prevention intervention for HIV+ YMSM. The new mHealth intervention composed of theory-driven elements, for example, including time and location-based reminders, and individual and group-based gaming incentives will then undergo usability testing consisting of (a) a focus group for specific feedback on design and user experience and then (b) a 12-month feasibility trial where 20 youth will have the application installed and usage, satisfaction, and clinical outcome data will be collected. In line with NIMH's research priorities, this proposal sets out to develop an innovative secondary prevention strategy targeting improved medication adherence and sexual risk reduction among HIV+ YMSM. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed mentored award supports the career development of the candidate into an independent patient- oriented researcher focused on improving the health of adolescents living with and at-risk for HIV/AIDS. The project aims to develop a new secondary prevention intervention, using mobile phone-based technologies, for HIV+ young men who have sex with men (YMSM), targeting key behaviors of sexual risk-taking and poor medication adherence. This research is highly relevant to public health as it targets improving health outcomes of HIV+ youth and preventing new infections among YMSM who are most disproportionately affected by the HIV

"Detecting and Monitoring Tardive Dyskinesia to Improve Patient Outcomes Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a common debilitating side effect of antipsychotic use. Characterized most notably by involuntary facial movements such as grimacing, involuntary lip, mouth, and tongue movements, and eye blinking, TD is difficult to treat and potentially irreversible. Psychiatrists and other mental health professionals are acutely aware of the impairment and disability experienced by patients who develop TD. Early detection of TD is critical so that appropriate interventions can be instituted. Unfortunately, despite professionals’ best efforts, it is often too late in the process and the involuntary movements are permanent. Antipsychotic prescriptions exceeded 50 million in 2011 and the reported incidence of TD is between 13% and 24%. Risk grows with advancing age, off-label uses, and chronic exposure to antipsychotics. Therefore, prevention and early detection are key to managing TD. However, current methods for monitoring patients require observation of patients at infrequent in-person visits or self-reporting by vigilant patients and their families. Therefore strong market potential exists for an automated detection system. This Phase I project proposes to leverage existing telepsychiatry and video interview data gathering technologies available commercially to efficiently collect and analyze one hundred ten (110) 5-minute video interviews with individuals taking anti-psychotic medications. Half of the interviews will be with individuals living with diagnosed TD and the other without a diagnosis of TD. The participants in the study will be recruited to ensure an equal distribution of females and males as well as an ethnically and racially representative sample. The proposed data gathering strategy will provide the source material necessary to create a powerful supervised machine learning derived video and audio analysis tool to detect TD. The detection tool will be created using 80% of the collected video data as a training set and validated on the remaining 20% reserved as the control set. Based on industry experience with other supervised machine learning training sets and the amount of data to be collected, we set a goal of a 90% success rate in identifying TD positive and TD negative participants in the control set. Once the detection tool is complete the project will conclude by incorporating access to the tool into an existing smartphone app, iRxReminder, that is used for data gathering and monitoring of medication adherence. The iRxReminder system links patients directly to researchers’ and healthcare professionals’ electronic records. The modified app will be tested in the laboratory to ensure the interface can be easily used. The addendum request includes additional funding to participate in the I-Corp training. Participants in the training will include CEO and PI/PD Anthony Sterns PhD, C-level executive Fred Pollock serving as iRxReminder’s CBO, and Industry Expert Fred Ma, MD PhD, who serves as iRxReminder’s regulatory consultant. In Phase II the iRxReminder system will be validated for use in supporting the self-management and symptom monitoring of medication taking by individuals living with chronic mental illnesses. Once feasibility is established, we propose a year-long RCT where participants will be monitored for early detection of TD along with goals for high adherence, improved control of symptoms and side effects, and more aggressive and frequent treatment responses by the healthcare team. A recent study reported that TD rates among newly treated elderly ranged from 7.2% for those taking Risperidone to 11.1% for those taking olanzapine after 2 years of treatment. Earlier meta-analyses estimate TD frequency in women to be 26.6% and in men 21.6%. Ethnically Chinese and Malaysian mental health patients were studied in Singapore and patients taking anti-psychotic medications were found to have TD in 40% and 29% of cases respectively. Regardless of prevalence, TD is a threat to patient adherence and quality of life. TD only remits in a minority of cases and can be permanent. With 50 million prescriptions for anti-psychotics written annually, more than 10 million persons living with a chronic mental illness are at risk of developing TD. There are likely over 6 million patients living with TD and the number of patients with TD is expected to grow with the aging population and increasing off- label use of antipsychotics.!",Detecting and Monitoring Tardive Dyskinesia to Improve Patient Outcomes,9660614,R43MH114763,"['Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Awareness ', ' Blinking ', ' eyeblink ', ' eye blink ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Family ', ' Female ', ' Goals ', ' Incidence ', ' Industry ', ' Institutes ', ' Interview ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lip structure ', ' Lip ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Persons ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Patients ', ' Psychiatrist ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Records ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Singapore ', ' Supervision ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Tongue ', ' Antipsychotic Agents ', ' Neuroleptics ', ' Neuroleptic Drugs ', ' Neuroleptic Agents ', ' Major Tranquilizing Agents ', ' Major Tranquilizers ', ' Antipsychotics ', ' Antipsychotic Drugs ', ' Woman ', ' Risperidone ', ' resperidone ', ' Medical Care Team ', ' Healthcare Team ', ' Health Care Team ', ' Self Management ', ' Chinese People ', ' Chinese ', ' Zyprexa ', ' olanzapine ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Mouth ', ' Cavitas Oris ', ' Buccal Cavity Head and Neck ', ' Buccal Cavity ', ' Oral cavity ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Malaysian ', ' Funding ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Involuntary Movements ', ' Frequencies ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Visit ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Participant ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Tardive Dyskinesia ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Patient observation ', ' Watchful Waiting ', ' Sampling ', ' Adverse effects ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Meta-Analyses ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' Compliance behavior ', ' therapy cooperation ', ' therapy compliance ', ' patient adherence ', ' compliance cooperation ', ' Treatment Compliance ', ' Patient Cooperation ', ' Patient Compliance ', ' Symptoms ', ' Addendum ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' manage symptom ', ' symptom management ', ' medication adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' Minority ', ' severe mental disorder ', ' serious mental illness ', ' serious mental disorder ', ' persistent mental illness ', ' chronic mental illness ', ' severe mental illness ', ' Prevalence ', ' Impairment ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' population aging ', ' aged population ', ' aging population ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' treatment response ', ' recruit ', ' iPhone Application ', ' iPhone App ', ' iOS application ', ' iOS app ', ' Smartphone App ', ' Smart Phone Application ', ' Smart Phone App ', ' Cellular Phone Application ', ' Cellular Phone App ', ' Cell phone App ', ' Cell Phone Application ', ' Android Application ', ' Android App ', ' smartphone Application ', ' ']",NIMH,"CREATIVE ACTION, LLC",R43,2018,50000,OH-13,0.06869667048974241
"DOT Diary (D2): Developing a mobile app with combined automated DOT and daily sexual diary for monitoring and improving PrEP adherence ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Several efficacy trials of pre-exposure prophylaxis (daily antiretroviral therapy to prevent HIV acquisition in uninfected persons with sexual exposures) have failed because of poor adherence to medications. To ensure accurate, longitudinal measurement of pill ingestion with real-time monitoring, we plan to develop DOT Diary (D2), a smartphone application that uses artificial intelligence for measuring pill taking using Directly Observed Therapy. This patented technology will be combined with a daily sexual diary for use in future PrEP observational and efficacy trials. Such an approach provides aggregated data for individual participants, study sites, and trials overall, that facilitates realtime feedback to maximize adherence. We plan a 3 stage process for building and evaluating D2. First, we will assess the assess the reliability and validity of the automated DOT tool to identify attempts to ""cheat"" and over-report pill taking, as well as to evaluate the sensitivity of the measure to detecting 1- to 3-week interruptions in pill use. Second, we will develop and optimize the feasibility and acceptability of D2 for participants and study staff in tracking participation ver time, and providing real-time adherence feedback to study participants. Lastly, we will run a 24-week pilot study of D2 for high-risk men who have sex with men to evaluate the plausibility that this tool can be successfully used to measure and optimize adherence in future PrEP trials. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many studies of pre-exposure prophylaxis or PrEP (giving an anti-HIV medication to an HIV uninfected person to prevent infection from their HIV positive sex partner) have failed to tell us whether or not the medication prevents infection, because very few of the study volunteers took the pills regularly. We will be developing and testing a new technology called DOT Diary (D2) that will be used by PrEP study volunteers to take pictures (using their smartphones) of themselves taking their pills, and also using their phones to keep track of their sexual practices. This will allow future studies to provide extra support for study volunteers not taking their medicines regularly, and to figure out whether or not the medications prevent new HIV infections.",DOT Diary (D2): Developing a mobile app with combined automated DOT and daily sexual diary for monitoring and improving PrEP adherence,9542909,R01MH109320,"['Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Behavior ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Color ', ' Data Aggregation ', ' Aggregated Data ', ' Data Collection ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Feedback ', ' Fumarates ', ' Future ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV antibody positive ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' Incidence ', ' Medicine ', ' Persons ', ' Legal patent ', ' Patents ', ' Patients ', ' Drug Kinetics ', ' Pharmacokinetics ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Recommendation ', ' Validity and Reliability ', ' Risk ', ' Running ', ' San Francisco ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' sex partner ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tuberculosis ', ' tuberculous spondyloarthropathy ', ' tuberculosis infection ', ' infection due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis ', ' disseminated tuberculosis ', ' disseminated TB ', ' TB infection ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection ', ' MTB infection ', ' M.tuberculosis infection ', ' M.tb infection ', ' M. tuberculosis infection ', ' M. tb infection ', ' M tuberculosis infection ', ' United States ', ' Measures ', ' Injectable ', ' Schedule ', ' Custom ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Biological ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Ingestion ', ' Individual ', ' Logistics ', ' Measurement ', ' Spottings ', ' tool ', ' diaries ', ' programs ', ' Tenofovir ', ' Viread ', ' Frequencies ', ' Oral ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Pattern ', ' Infection prevention ', ' Prevent infection ', ' Performance ', ' forgetting ', ' Anti-Retroviral Agents ', ' antiretroviral ', ' anti-retroviral ', ' Antiretroviral Agents ', ' Participant ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' Reporting ', ' Directly Observed Therapy ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' emtricitabine ', "" beta-L-2',3'-dideoxy-5-fluoro-3'-thiacytidine "", ' HIV diagnosis ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' pill ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Effectiveness ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Dose ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Interruption ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' sex risk ', ' cost ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' efficacy trial ', ' men at high risk ', ' high risk men ', ' volunteer ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' FDA approved ', ' treatment adherence ', ' compare efficacy ', ' comparative efficacy ', ' Regimen ', ' adolescent men ', ' adolescent man ', ' young man ', ' mobile app ', ' mobile application ', ' young MSM ', ' YMSM ', ' young men who have sex with men ', ' dashboard ', ' PrEP ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' iPhone Application ', ' iPhone App ', ' iOS application ', ' iOS app ', ' Smartphone App ', ' Smart Phone Application ', ' Smart Phone App ', ' Cellular Phone Application ', ' Cellular Phone App ', ' Cell phone App ', ' Cell Phone Application ', ' Android Application ', ' Android App ', ' smartphone Application ', ' real time monitoring ', ' facial recognition software ', ' ']",NIMH,PUBLIC HEALTH FOUNDATION ENTERPRISES,R01,2018,760876,CA-32,0.1706983562887976
"Development of a novel medication adherability tool to improve cardiovascular disease management Nearly half of patients with heart disease become non-adherent to their prescribed therapies within a year of treatment initiation. This is a central and modifiable reason why cardiovascular disease remains a leading cause of death in the US. Despite numerous attempts to develop interventions aimed at improving adherence, these attempts have had varying and often limited success; one explanation could be that underlying barriers to adherence are not being addressed. Those interventions that have been successful often make medications easier to take but are frequently expensive to implement or deployed too late. Developing a novel provider- facing intervention that modifies medication “adherability”, defined as the properties of medications that make them difficult for patients to take, could be especially impactful and relatively inexpensive. For example, more than 30% of patients report difficulties swallowing prescribed medicines, yet little is known how this “adherability” affects long-term adherence and clinical outcomes, and few interventions focus on these issues.  To this end, Dr. Lauffenburger’s K01 proposal incorporates a novel prophylactic, patient-centric approach to provider behavior change for cardiovascular disease management. Providers often do not know what the medications they prescribe actually look like or what aspects of the medications are acceptable to or preferred by their patients. This study will uniquely incorporate patient perspectives about medication properties that lead to poor adherence in the design of a scalable provider-facing clinical decision support intervention.  The proposed aims are to: (1) develop a comprehensive framework of cardiovascular medication properties, such as appearance, side-effect profiles, or dosing, that may lead to poor adherence using patient focus groups; (2) rigorously evaluate their effects on adherence and clinical outcomes in large national data sources; (3) develop and externally validate a novel clinical prediction rule for medication adherability; and (4) develop and pilot test novel web- and electronic health record-based prescribing tools based on the prediction rule for providers. The expected overall impact of this innovative proposal is that it will fundamentally advance how to personalize medications for patients to ultimately improve adherence and health outcomes.  Dr. Lauffenburger has a unique background as a practicing pharmacist trained in epidemiology with a proven commitment to research. This proposal includes an educational plan that will address gaps in her training: expertise in behavioral sciences, prediction modeling, and implementation research. The mentorship team, led by Niteesh Choudhry, an expert in adherence and implementation, includes well-known experts in cardiovascular trials (Elliott Antman, co-mentor), biostatistics (Robert Glynn, co-mentor), and behavioral sciences (Daniel Solomon, co-mentor), and will ensure scientific success and training. By the conclusion of this program, she will be able to independently design, target, and evaluate behavioral interventions for heart diseases. The results of the proposed K01 will be invaluable pilot work for a planned R01-level application. We propose a novel strategy to address the epidemic of poor adherence to cardiovascular therapies: tailoring medications for vulnerable patients based on their “adherability”, or the properties of medication like dosing frequency, palatability, and side-effect profiles, that make them difficult to take regularly. To achieve the proposed research, we will conduct focus groups with at-risk patients, determine the effect of adherability on long-term adherence and cardiovascular outcomes, develop and validate a novel adherability clinical prediction rule, and pilot test a simple, scalable clinical decision support tool for providers. The overarching goal is to improve clinical outcomes by optimizing medications for patients at the time of prescribing, which is a central mission of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI).",Development of a novel medication adherability tool to improve cardiovascular disease management,9502161,K01HL141538,"['Affect ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Color ', ' Data Sources ', ' Decision Making ', ' Deglutition ', ' Swallowing ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Epidemic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' mortality ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacists ', ' Research ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' Review Literature ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Disease Management ', ' Disorder Management ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Frequencies ', ' prophylactic ', ' Route ', ' behavior change ', ' success ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Appearance ', ' Palate ', ' health belief ', ' health-related belief ', ' Property ', ' theories ', ' Adverse effects ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' medication adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' systematic review ', ' NHLBI ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' implementation research ', ' virtual ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' successful intervention ', ' Regimen ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' unique treatment ', ' tailored treatment ', ' tailored therapy ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' individualized treatment ', ' individualized therapy ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' customized treatment ', ' customized therapy ', ' individualized medicine ', ' Patient risk ', ' support tools ', ' individual patient ', ' clinical decision support ', ' cardiometabolic ', ' cardiometabolism ', ' ']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K01,2018,143581,MA-07,0.26191630619579964
"mHealth intervention for ART adherence and sexual risk reduction among HIV+ YMSM DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The candidate is an adolescent medicine specialist and Director of Adolescent HIV Services at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia with a research focus on using mobile technology to improve adherence and other health outcomes for adolescents at risk for and living with HIV/AIDS. The candidate proposes a career development program that will provide her with the skills and experience to become an independent investigator in the field of adolescent HIV research. In addition to didactic coursework in quantitative and qualitative research methodology and health behavior theory, the candidate's career development will be guided by a multidisciplinary team of nationally recognized advisors committed to her success. [She will form a Technology Advisory Board for mentorship and preceptorships in all aspects of mobile health (mHealth) technology, including incubation and development of technology-based health interventions, study design and analysis techniques for big data/machine learning, gamification theory, user interface/responsive design techniques, usability testing, and the application of health behavior theory to develop mHealth interventions.] Career development activities will be complemented by practical experience gained through the conduct of original research. This proposal examines key health behaviors of medication adherence and sexual risk among young men who have sex with men (YMSM) living with HIV/AIDS, and proposes to develop a mobile phone based intervention targeted at improving these health behaviors in the real times and places youth need support. AIM 1 will describe the incidence of STI co-infections and virologic failure and report the standardized risk of these outcomes across strata of HIV+ YMSM through retrospective chart review augmented by in-depth structured interviews for further understanding of key psychosocial and behavioral factors. Using focus groups of youth at high- and low-risk, selected based on findings from AIM 1, AIM 2 will explore how HIV+ YMSM use mobile technology, and their attitudes towards various mobile phone-based tools to improve adherence and reduce sexual risk. Delphi methodology will first be used in AIM 3 to convene a panel of mHealth and adolescent health experts to establish consensus guidelines for adolescent sexual health technology-based intervention development. These results, combined with youth input from AIM 2, will serve as a guiding framework for development of a new mHealth secondary prevention intervention for HIV+ YMSM. The new mHealth intervention composed of theory-driven elements, for example, including time and location-based reminders, and individual and group-based gaming incentives will then undergo usability testing consisting of (a) a focus group for specific feedback on design and user experience and then (b) a 12-month feasibility trial where 20 youth will have the application installed and usage, satisfaction, and clinical outcome data will be collected. In line with NIMH's research priorities, this proposal sets out to develop an innovative secondary prevention strategy targeting improved medication adherence and sexual risk reduction among HIV+ YMSM. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed mentored award supports the career development of the candidate into an independent patient- oriented researcher focused on improving the health of adolescents living with and at-risk for HIV/AIDS. The project aims to develop a new secondary prevention intervention, using mobile phone-based technologies, for HIV+ young men who have sex with men (YMSM), targeting key behaviors of sexual risk-taking and poor medication adherence. This research is highly relevant to public health as it targets improving health outcomes of HIV+ youth and preventing new infections among YMSM who are most disproportionately affected by the HIV

"Tailored Drug Titration through Artificial Intelligence Optima Integrated Health Inc. (Optima) proposes to demonstrate the clinical efficacy of the decision support technology for medication treatment optimization it validated in a pilot clinical trial, optima4BP. optima4BP is designed as a physician decision/action support aid in timely and safely optimizing medication treatment independent of in-office visits, for patients with uncontrolled hypertension (HTN). optima4BP is designed to reduce preventable hospitalizations and the associated incidence of stroke, heart failure (HF) or myocardial infarction (MI) events resulting from high blood pressure (BP) above goal. Uncontrolled HTN affects 34 million Americans. The cost of HTN-associated hospitalizations is $113 billion, or 15% of all hospital costs, with >135 million Emergency Dptm. (ED) visits. optima4BP will improve the quality of life for uncontrolled HTN patients, and reduce this massive burden on the US healthcare system. Our long term objective is to help drive the transformation from the reactive pay-for-service healthcare paradigm to one that emphasizes preventative care through personalized health surveillance, assessment, and action via timely and safely optimized medication treatment. Our specific aims include: Aim (1) demonstrating the efficacy of optima4BP in a randomized clinical trial (n=300 patients) deployed at UC San Francisco Medical Center. Patients will be randomized to an enhanced care (EC) arm or an optima4BP arm (O4BP). All patients will use Omron10 BP arm cuff to remotely measure their BP. For the patients in the EC arm, physicians will be provided with a monthly summary of the Omron10 data. For patients in the O4BP arm, aside from the BP monthly summary, physicians will receive (a) a risk stratified patient roster, (b) next step actions in medication optimization for each patient, and (c) access to optima4BP's secure web-service medication treatment modeling to investigate how changing current patient data could affect medication choice (e.g., change in medication choice if BP goal is lowered). We will then examine the BP value reduction between arms (success:>7 mmHg decreased systolic; >4 mmHg decreased diastolic of O4BP vs. EC), along with secondary outcomes between O4BP and EC: medication treatment action frequency; ED admissions due to HTN-related symptoms and associated hospitalizations for stroke, HF or MI; and overall cost of HTN management. Aim (2) optima4BP data processing steps will be optimized to scale-up its capability to >1000/day patient cases processing power. 3 specific optimization processing tools will be developed: Optima Extract, Transform, and Load (OETL); Optima Survey Generator (OSG), and Optima Message Builder (OMB). OETL will provide streamlined scheduling logic to extracting data from Epic® EMR (electronic medical record), optimize data mapping scripts within optima4BP, and optimize data uploading protocols. OSG will optimize the current generation protocol for patient surveys, patient response, and assignment of patient responses to specific processing modules. OMB will ensure streamlined scheduling of risk stratification updates and scheduled delivery to physician In-Basket messaging system within Epic® EHR. Our goal is to simplify the management of high blood pressure (BP) while improving the quality of care of patients and reducing the associated costs. We will investigate the benefits of a novel surveillance- assessment-medication treatment action artificial intelligence (optima4BP) as a physician decision support aid in timely and safely optimizing medication treatment independent of in-office visits, with the goal of reducing preventable hospitalizations and the associated incidence of stroke, heart failure or heart attack events.",Tailored Drug Titration through Artificial Intelligence,9494417,R44HL132622,"['Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' health care delivery ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hypersensitivity ', ' Allergy ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Intelligence ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Laboratories ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Logic ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' heart infarction ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart attack ', ' coronary infarction ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Office Visits ', ' physician office visit ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Risk ', ' San Francisco ', ' Stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Gender ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Businesses ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Schedule ', ' Caring ', ' Custom ', ' Titrations ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Hospitalization cost ', ' Hospital Costs ', ' Ensure ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' tool ', ' Frequencies ', ' Event ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' System ', ' Visit ', ' Medical center ', ' innovative technologies ', ' American ', ' success ', ' Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ', ' United States Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ', ' Public Law 104-191 ', ' PL104-191 ', ' PL 104-191 ', ' Kennedy Kassebaum Act ', ' HIPAA ', ' blood pressure regulation ', ' regulate blood pressure ', ' regulate BP ', ' blood pressure management ', ' blood pressure homeostasis ', ' blood pressure control ', ' BP regulation ', ' BP management ', ' BP homeostasis ', ' BP control ', ' novel ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' Modeling ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Adverse effects ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' computerized data processing ', ' data processing ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Update ', ' medication adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' web-based service ', ' web services ', ' cost ', ' hypertension treatment ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' clinical efficacy ', ' scale up ', ' commercial application ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' hypertension management ', ' hypertension control ', ' Secure ', ' arm ', ' cloud based ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' health data ', ' reduction in blood pressure ', ' reduction in BP ', ' reduce blood pressure ', ' reduce BP ', ' lowers blood pressure ', ' lower blood pressure ', ' lower BP ', ' BP reduction ', ' blood pressure reduction ', ' stratified patient ', ' patient stratification ', ' Preventative care ', ' Preventive care ', ' healthcare service ', ' health care service ', ' Risk stratification ', ' coordinating care ', ' care coordination ', ' responsive patient ', ' patient response ', ' therapy optimization ', ' treatment optimization ', ' incidence of stroke ', ' stroke incidence ', ' risk of stroke ', ' stroke risk ', ' ']",NHLBI,"OPTIMA INTEGRATED HEALTH, INC.",R44,2018,649649,CA-12,0.10628987894684383
"HEART: Adding Memory to Reasoning: macHine lEArning tailoRed drug Titration Hypertension (HTN) affects 73 million Americans, with an annual hospitalization cost of $113 billion/year. Clinical trial outcomes of optima4BP (O4BP), a clinical reasoning artificial intelligence (AI) system, determined that the success/failure of past anti-HTN medication treatments can be utilized to improve O4BP predictive performance. Our objective for this Phase I proposal is to investigate the feasibility of building a past treatment success/failure “memory” function into O4BP. O4BP, an innovation of Optima Integrated Health, is functional at UC San Francisco Medical Center (UCSF MC), the clinical collaborating partner. O4BP AI safely optimizes HTN medication treatment independent of in-office visits. It collects and analyzes current patient health information from multiple sources to determine if a medication optimization is required. O4BP then alerts the physician of a need for a medication change by providing a clinically supported treatment recommendation action. In this Phase I, we propose the development and validation of O4BP's “memory” by using the principles of Instance Based Learning (IBL). Known for its flexibility and intuitive logic, the IBL theory will be adapted to enhance the predictive treatment efficacy power of O4BP. It will lead to incorporating the patient response (success/failure) from past treatments to rank the efficacy of candidate treatments identified by O4BP for HTN medication optimization. Clinical resources [e.g., Electronic Health Record (EHR)] provide incomplete patient information, insufficient to build the “memory” functionality using retrospective datasets. Therefore, in Aim 1, a clinical trial (n=50) will be conducted to collect complete patient datasets that will be used to build the “memory” function: (a) BP data from remotely monitored BP; (b) EHR updates to the patient's profile since last cycle data dump; and (c) personalized online surveys for patient reporting of medication adherence, side- effects (SEs), and cardiovascular symptoms. Aim 2 will utilize the datasets to develop an efficacy proximity map 2x/month of candidate treatments to past treatments using IBL theory. The proximity map will be based on scored past treatment(s) efficacy, defined as a combination of success in BP lowering, reducing of SEs, and targeting minimum number of drugs with maximum BP lowering power. The treatment recommendation alert will be sent to the physician, for consideration. This study design allows immediate clinical adjudication of the IBL “memory” through physician's choice to implement/reject the treatment action alert, made available 2x/month for each patient. “Memory” enhanced O4BP is expected to lead to a systolic BP (SBP) reduction ≥10mmHg by the end of the scheduled 12 months treatment optimization period. Successful development and validation will position the “memory” enhanced O4BP for deployment at UCSF MC that serves approximately 20,000 patients with an SBP >160mmHg, poorly controlled, and at high risk for primary or recurrent stroke, heart failure or myocardial infarction. Our long-term objective is to transform the reactive and punctuated nature of HTN medication treatment management into a proactive and ongoing component of patient care. Our goal is to simplify the medication management of high blood pressure (BP) for the treating physician while improving the quality of care of patients and reducing the associated costs. We will develop an artificial processing intelligence that will allow our current product, optima4BP, to enhance its efficacy evaluation of candidate medication treatments as a function of past treatments performance. optima4BP is a decision support clinical reasoning artificial intelligence designed to safely optimize medication treatment by a physician, independent of in-office visits in

"The Adherence Promotion with Person-centered Technology (APPT) Project: Promoting Adherence to Enhance the Early Detection and Treatment of Cognitive Decline Many older adults experience declines in cognitive ability that can be substantial, including mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease and AD-related dementia. Population aging, coupled with age-related cognitive impairment, including Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias, represents an unprecedented challenge. Early detection of cognitive impairment is a crucial goal. This would allow individuals at risk for mild cognitive impairment and/or AD/ADRD to adopt lifestyle changes to minimize decrements and the risk for acquired cognitive impairment. However, the massive potential of cognitive training and longitudinal assessment to detect and prevent age-related cognitive impairment and dementia are unlikely to be realized unless individuals are willing and able to engage with these protocols for an extended period of time. Adherence to cognitive assessment and training is often poor. Addressing the gap between potential and realized benefits of early detection and prevention of cognitive impairment is an urgent goal as the population ages. The aims of the Adherence Promotion with Person-centered Technology (APPT) project are to promote early detection and treatment of age-related cognitive impairment and dementia by 1) enhancing adherence to cognitive intervention and assessment protocols, 2) improving understanding of barriers to long-term adherence, and 3) assisting in the development of algorithms for predicting and preventing adherence failures. Projects aim to investigate these issues within samples of older adults with and without cognitive impairment. Two randomized controlled trials will test an adaptive, tailored, and integrated technology support system predicted to boost adherence to cognitive protocols, over and above a simpler scheduling and reminder system over 6 months. Studies will provide valuable and generalizable insight into not only the benefits of adherence support, but also the individual difference factors that shape protocol adherence (e.g., attitudes, cognitive ability, dementia status, health status, personality, technology proficiency). Data will inform the process of identifying individuals who would benefit from additional support, and predicting and preventing extended adherence failures before they happen. By increasing adherence, these studies will help improve early detection and treatment of cognitive impairment, which will ultimately extend older adults' functional independence, improving their lives and the lives of their families, and reducing care and support resources needed to address lost independence like that associated with Alzheimer’s disease and AD-related dementia. Further, intervention studies for dementia and Alzheimer’s disease can be made more efficient through tools for identifying individuals likely to experience decline before substantial cognitive impairment has occurred. Results have implications that extend far beyond cognitive impairment; the methods and mechanisms uncovered have broad implications for technology-mediated assessment and protocols to enhance health and well-being in general. The project consists of two large randomized controlled trials and smaller needs assessment and usability studies that will guide their development and deployment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The aims of the Adherence Promotion with Person-centered Technology (APPT) project are to promote early detection and treatment of age-related cognitive impairment and dementia. This project will develop Artificial Intelligence-based reminder systems to help ensure long-term engagement to home-based cognitive assessment and cognitive training protocols to be able to detect and treat cognitive impairment as soon as possible.",The Adherence Promotion with Person-centered Technology (APPT) Project: Promoting Adherence to Enhance the Early Detection and Treatment of Cognitive Decline,9801140,R01AG064529,"['Personality ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Weight ', ' Measures ', ' Reminder Systems ', ' Mediating ', ' Schedule ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Age-associated memory impairment ', ' age related memory dysfunction ', ' age related cognitive impairment ', ' age related cognitive deficit ', ' age associated memory decline ', ' Benign senescent forgetfulness ', ' Age-related cognitive decline ', ' Age-associated cognitive decline ', ' Adopted ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' preference ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Support System ', ' Social Support System ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' cognitive change ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cognitive training ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Population ', ' Cognitive aging ', ' Individual Differences ', ' Coupled ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' person centered ', ' usability ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' aging population ', ' population aging ', ' aged population ', ' public health relevance ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' cognitive performance ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' cognitive ability ', ' mobile computing ', ' mobile technology ', ' mobile platform ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' functional independence ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' Alzheimer related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' behavioral adherence ', ' behavior adherence ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Attitude ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cognition ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Interview ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' Methods ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' ']",NIA,FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,554286,FL-05,0.07327332117048485
"Development of a novel medication adherability tool to improve cardiovascular disease management Nearly half of patients with heart disease become non-adherent to their prescribed therapies within a year of treatment initiation. This is a central and modifiable reason why cardiovascular disease remains a leading cause of death in the US. Despite numerous attempts to develop interventions aimed at improving adherence, these attempts have had varying and often limited success; one explanation could be that underlying barriers to adherence are not being addressed. Those interventions that have been successful often make medications easier to take but are frequently expensive to implement or deployed too late. Developing a novel provider- facing intervention that modifies medication “adherability”, defined as the properties of medications that make them difficult for patients to take, could be especially impactful and relatively inexpensive. For example, more than 30% of patients report difficulties swallowing prescribed medicines, yet little is known how this “adherability” affects long-term adherence and clinical outcomes, and few interventions focus on these issues.  To this end, Dr. Lauffenburger’s K01 proposal incorporates a novel prophylactic, patient-centric approach to provider behavior change for cardiovascular disease management. Providers often do not know what the medications they prescribe actually look like or what aspects of the medications are acceptable to or preferred by their patients. This study will uniquely incorporate patient perspectives about medication properties that lead to poor adherence in the design of a scalable provider-facing clinical decision support intervention.  The proposed aims are to: (1) develop a comprehensive framework of cardiovascular medication properties, such as appearance, side-effect profiles, or dosing, that may lead to poor adherence using patient focus groups; (2) rigorously evaluate their effects on adherence and clinical outcomes in large national data sources; (3) develop and externally validate a novel clinical prediction rule for medication adherability; and (4) develop and pilot test novel web- and electronic health record-based prescribing tools based on the prediction rule for providers. The expected overall impact of this innovative proposal is that it will fundamentally advance how to personalize medications for patients to ultimately improve adherence and health outcomes.  Dr. Lauffenburger has a unique background as a practicing pharmacist trained in epidemiology with a proven commitment to research. This proposal includes an educational plan that will address gaps in her training: expertise in behavioral sciences, prediction modeling, and implementation research. The mentorship team, led by Niteesh Choudhry, an expert in adherence and implementation, includes well-known experts in cardiovascular trials (Elliott Antman, co-mentor), biostatistics (Robert Glynn, co-mentor), and behavioral sciences (Daniel Solomon, co-mentor), and will ensure scientific success and training. By the conclusion of this program, she will be able to independently design, target, and evaluate behavioral interventions for heart diseases. The results of the proposed K01 will be invaluable pilot work for a planned R01-level application. We propose a novel strategy to address the epidemic of poor adherence to cardiovascular therapies: tailoring medications for vulnerable patients based on their “adherability”, or the properties of medication like dosing frequency, palatability, and side-effect profiles, that make them difficult to take regularly. To achieve the proposed research, we will conduct focus groups with at-risk patients, determine the effect of adherability on long-term adherence and cardiovascular outcomes, develop and validate a novel adherability clinical prediction rule, and pilot test a simple, scalable clinical decision support tool for providers. The overarching goal is to improve clinical outcomes by optimizing medications for patients at the time of prescribing, which is a central mission of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI).",Development of a novel medication adherability tool to improve cardiovascular disease management,9687744,K01HL141538,"['Affect ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Color ', ' Data Sources ', ' Decision Making ', ' Swallowing ', ' Deglutition ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Epidemic ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' mortality ', ' Out-patients ', ' Outpatients ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacists ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Internet ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Review Literature ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Disease Management ', ' Disorder Management ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Frequencies ', ' prophylactic ', ' Route ', ' behavior change ', ' success ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Appearance ', ' Palate ', ' health belief ', ' health-related belief ', ' Property ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' medication compliance ', ' medication adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' systematic review ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' NHLBI ', ' implementation research ', ' virtual ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' Outcome ', ' Consumption ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' successful intervention ', ' Regimen ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' individualized medicine ', ' unique treatment ', ' tailored treatment ', ' tailored therapy ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' individualized treatment ', ' individualized therapy ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' customized treatment ', ' customized therapy ', ' support tools ', ' individual patient ', ' clinical decision support ', ' cardiometabolism ', ' cardiometabolic ', ' side effect ', ' ']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K01,2019,143581,MA-07,0.26191630619579964
"Personalized Patient data and behavioral nudges to improve adherence to chronic cardiovascular medications Abstract Our objective in this project is to employ population level pharmacy data and delivery of nudges via cell phone text messaging and artificially intelligent (AI) interactive chat bot to improve medication adherence and patient outcomes in 3 integrated healthcare delivery systems (HCS): University of Colorado Health System (UCHealth), VA Eastern Colorado Health Care System (VA), and Denver Health Medical Center (DH). We will identify patients with chronic cardiovascular (CV) conditions taking medications to treat hypertension, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, diabetes and/or hyperlipidemia. We will leverage pharmacy refill data to identify episodes of non-adherence through gaps in medication refills and randomize individuals to 1 of 4 study arms when they have a first refill gap: 1) usual care; 2) generic text message reminder; 3) tailored and engaging text messages optimized to facilitate behavior change; or 4) optimized text messages plus a pre- programmed AI interactive chat bot designed to support identification and resolution of barriers to medication refill and adherence. In the UG3 phase (year 1), we will develop and program a theoretically informed technology-based (a) text message library and (b) chat bot content library using multiple and iterative N of 1 within subject studies to optimize content for a range of diverse patients. These outcomes will inform a pilot intervention to demonstrate feasibility of delivering the intervention and preliminary effects in all 3 HCS. We will also engage patient, provider and health systems stakeholders in designing, refining, and implementing the pilot intervention. In the UH3 phase (years 2-5), we will conduct a pragmatic patient-level randomized intervention across 3 HCS to improve adherence to chronic CV medications. We will evaluate the intervention using a mixed methods approach and apply the RE-AIM (reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance) framework. In addition, we will assess the context and implementation processes to inform local tailoring, adaptations and modifications, and eventual expansion of the intervention. Project Narrative Given the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases that require ongoing treatment with medications, the problem of medication non-adherence is unlikely to go away and will grow. This study will employ population level pharmacy data to identify non-adherent patients and utilize ubiquitous cell phone technology to send them tailored, engaging and motivating text messages and text message based chat through an artificially intelligent (AI) interactive chat bot to improve cardiac medication adherence and patient outcomes in 3 integrated healthcare delivery systems. This study will advance medication adherence research and the intervention could be applied to multiple clinical conditions requiring medications for long term treatment and other NIH institutes.!",Personalized Patient data and behavioral nudges to improve adherence to chronic cardiovascular medications,9750927,UH3HL144163,"['Adoption ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Atrial Fibrillation ', ' Auricular Fibrillation ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Colorado ', ' coronary arterial disease ', ' atherosclerotic coronary disease ', ' Coronary Atherosclerosis ', ' Coronary Artery Disorder ', ' Coronary Artery Disease ', ' Coronary Arteriosclerosis ', ' Decision Making ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' promoting health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Hyperlipemia ', ' Hyperlipidemia ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Institutes ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Libraries ', ' Maintenance ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Stasys Medical: A Rapid, Microfluidic Blood Test Sensitive to Platelet Dysfunction PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Antiplatelet medications are a critical component to manage cardiovascular diseases (CVD), which is a prevalent affliction in the US. While monitoring platelet therapy is of increasing importance for the identification of hypo- or hyper-responsive patients, there is not a clear picture of the medical value of tailored antiplatelet therapy using currently available platelet function tests. Currently, US FDA cleared assays of platelet function designed to be near the patient measure platelet adhesion and aggregation. Stasys Medical is developing a system based on patented platelet contraction sensors to assay platelet contraction force as a biomarker for platelet dysfunction. In the current project, the Company will build on preliminary data to demonstrate that the force biomarker is sensitive to platelet inhibition via multiple pathways. Specifically, aims are designed to 1) correlate the platelet contractile force measurements to inhibition of platelet activation and adhesion pathways, and 2) benchmark the force assay to standard platelet function tests. The go/no-go criteria for moving to Phase II is demonstration that platelet force is sensitive to specific inhibitors and that the assay can identify platelet dysfunction currently missed by existing standard platelet function assays. In the Phase II project we will leverage data generated in the current project to develop an algorithm that can automatically identify antiplatelet medications. Clinically, this will be a valuable tool to identify medication non-responders. Taken together, the project will be used to support the Company’s 510(k) submission to FDA with claims directed at evaluating platelet function to assess clinical conditions, such as bleeding risk, associated with the use of antiplatelet drugs, and during and following cardiovascular surgery. PROJECT NARRATIVE Antiplatelet medications are a critical component to manage cardiovascular diseases (CVD), which is a prevalent affliction in the US. In the Phase I project, Stasys Medical will build on preliminary data to show that the platelet contraction force biomarker reflects platelet function as proof-of-concept that the force assay can identify platelet dysfunction missed by existing assays.

"Personalized multimedication packaging with integrated real-time instrumentation to improve adherence Abstract Approximately 23% of Americans take 3 or more prescription medications, often as a part of complex drug regimens that challenge adherence, contributing to treatment failures and costing US healthcare $100 billion or more, annually. Difficulties managing polypharmacy negatively impact all stakeholders – patients, doctors, pharmacies and insurers. The problem is particularly significant in elder-care, as the likelihood of developing chronic conditions treatable by medication increases and multiple characteristics of this population pose assorted risks for medication errors. Custom multimedication packaging has shown promise in addressing some of the drivers of non-adherence, but offers no solution for other drivers such as errors in drug reconciliation, healthcare practitioner involvement, care coordination and patient education. The multiple stakeholders in medication prescribing and utilization practices constitute a variety of potential sources of medication management problems, but also a diverse set of clients for polypharmacy solutions. Insightfil is developing a comprehensive medication management solution that incorporates convenience packaging with passive detection of medication adherence to provide essential and medicine-related information in real-time generating a channel for more accurate information exchange between all stakeholders for improved patient care and satisfaction. In previous work, we designed, built and tested a robotic workstation that offers innovative patient drug packaging, which is unique in its ability to avoid medication cross-contamination. Leveraging our successful launch of the medication dispensing robot, the goal of this Phase I SBIR is to develop instrument pill pouches and use the resulting real- time adherence data to improve the way patients are nudged into increased adherence through more personalized and context-specific communications. Toward this end we propose Specific Aims to develop three components of the technology: 1) a near-field communication (NFC) sensor that is compatible with the emerging industry standard for custom fill convenience packaging; 2) a smartphone app that reads the NFC tags to verify that a medication pack has been opened; and 3) a smartphone app to deliver real-time, context sensitive patient messaging based on medication use patterns. Once the prototype system is developed, we will conduct a pilot study (Specific Aim 4) of 30 multimedication users to provide preliminary evidence of the efficacy and acceptability of Insightfil's platform technology. After establishing proof-of-concept through the completion of the SBIR Phase I project, we will refine the resulting prototype technology into a more robust commercial grade system with an expanded-features patient app ready for pilot deployment in 1-2 pharmacies serving 5,000 patients (Phase II). Significantly, the research design required for commercialization will not require FDA approval for deployment in pharmacies - Pharmacists will follow all regulations applicable to the dispensing of medications.

"Drug Benefit Design and Adherence Disparities in Older Adults Project Summary/Abstract Underuse of clinically effective medications among minority adults in midlife may contribute to racial and ethnic disparities in chronic disease related morbidity and mortality in late life. Medication affordability has been identified as an important driver of disparities in treatment adherence and recent trends in employer-sponsored prescription drug coverage toward increased patient cost sharing (e.g., copays) have the potential to exacerbate these disparities. Yet, there is a paucity of strong research evidence on the effects of out-of-pocket (OOP) drug costs on disparities in treatment adherence over the life course. In a prior study, we found evidence of a complex relationship between OOP drug costs and adherence which likely differs by race and ethnicity over time. For example, as patients age and OOP costs increase due to higher drug burden, patients may become more sensitive to cumulative drug costs regardless of race or ethnicity. In addition, potentially modifiable factors at the provider (e.g., prescribing habits) and health system level (e.g., refill complexity) may interact with OOP drug costs in ways that exacerbate adherence disparities in midlife. However, our prior study could not adequately explore these complex and interacting factors. The primary objective of this competing renewal is to estimate the effect of OOP drug costs on disparities in medication adherence among middle-aged adults (40-64) within a large integrated health care setting (>4 million members) offering a wide variety of drug benefits and consistent access to primary care. We hypothesize that the relationship between OOP drug costs and racial and ethnic differences in adherence will be modified by age. In addition, we will examine potential interactions between OOP drug costs and modifiable factors at the provider and health system level that may amplify disparities in adherence. Focusing on patients with cardiometabolic conditions (i.e., hypertension, diabetes) and select medication classes (e.g., lipid lowering, antihypertensives, antidiabetes), we will leverage a rich longitudinal electronic medical record and employ rigorous statistical methods to estimate the effect of OOP drug costs on medication adherence overall and by race and ethnicity, including examining age-specific effects and interactions between OOP drug costs and modifiable factors at the provider and health system level. In addition, we will identify aids and barriers to integrating health equity as a measurable criterion for evaluating drug benefit designs and relevant contextual factors from the perspective of decision makers (e.g., employers, health plans, pharmacy benefit managers).

"Evaluation of multiple medication exposures concurrently using a novel algorithm PROJECT SUMMARY The development of large observational health databases (OHD) has expanded the data available for analysis by pharmacoepidemiology research. The efficiency of these studies may be improved by simultaneously studying the association of multiple medications with a disease of interest. Unfortunately, prior research has demonstrated that it is difficult to distinguish true-positive from false-positive results when studying multiple exposures simultaneously, thus limiting the conclusions drawn from these types of studies and representing a major gap in the field. The objective of this proposal, which is the first step in achieving the applicant's long- term goal of improving the diagnosis and treatment of gastrointestinal diseases using insights derived from OHD, is to evaluate and validate medication class enrichment analysis (MCEA), a novel set-based signal-to- noise enrichment algorithm developed by the applicant to analyze multiple exposures from OHD with high sensitivity and specificity. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that MCEA has equal sensitivity and greater specificity compared to logistic regression, the most widely used analytic method for OHD, for identifying true associations between medications and clinical outcomes. The applicant will complete the following two interrelated specific aims to test the hypothesis: Aim 1 – to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of medication class enrichment analysis (MCEA) and logistic regression (LR) for identifying medication associations with Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and Aim 2 – to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of MCEA and LR for identifying medication associations with gastrointestinal hemorrhage (GIH). The rationale for these aims is that by reproducing known medication-disease associations without false positives, MCEA can be used to identify novel pharmacologic associations with gastrointestinal diseases in future studies. The expected outcome for the proposed research is that it will demonstrate MCEA as a valid method for pharmacoepidemiology research, opening new research opportunities for the study of multi-exposure OHD. These new research opportunities may lead to more rapid identification of potential pharmacologic causes of emerging diseases and discovery of unanticipated beneficial medication effects, allowing such medications to be repurposed for new indications. To attain the expected outcome, the applicant will complete additional coursework that builds on his Master of Science in Clinical Epidemiology to learn computational biology, machine learning, and econometrics techniques. With the support of this grant and his institution, he will also directly apply these techniques to pharmacoepidemiology applications under the close mentorship of a carefully selected team of faculty with extensive experience in gastroenterology, pharmacoepidemiology, medical informatics, and mentoring prior K-award grant recipients. Through these activities, the applicant will develop the skills necessary to obtain NIH R01-level funding and become a leader in developing novel techniques for application to the epidemiologic study of gastrointestinal diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE Traditionally, research studying medications associated with diseases are limited to analyzing one medication at a time. This novel proposal will validate medication class enrichment analysis, a recently developed algorithm to study multiple medications simultaneously for association with a disease of interest. Validation of this method will allow researchers to use existing medical databases to more rapidly identify potential medication causes of emerging diseases and identify medications with unanticipated beneficial effects, allowing such medications to be repurposed for new indications.",Evaluation of multiple medication exposures concurrently using a novel algorithm,9645854,K08DK119475,"['Algorithms ', ' Aminoglycosides ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents ', ' nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ', ' non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs ', ' non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ', ' Nonsteroidal Antiinflammatory Drug ', ' Nonsteroidal Antiinflammatory Agents ', ' Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents ', ' Non Steroidal Antiinflammatory Agents ', ' NSAIDs ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Anticoagulants ', ' thrombopoiesis inhibitor ', ' blood thinner ', ' Anticoagulant Drugs ', ' Anticoagulant Agents ', ' Carbapenems ', ' Carbapenem Antibiotics ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Cephalosporin Antibiotics ', ' Cephalosporins ', ' Charge ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Diagnosis ', ' digestive tract disease ', ' digestive disorder ', ' GI tract disorder ', ' Digestive System Diseases ', ' Digestive Diseases ', ' Digestive System Disorders ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Methods Epidemiology ', ' Epidemiological Techniques ', ' Epidemiological Methods ', ' Epidemiologic Methods ', ' Faculty ', ' Future ', ' Gastroenterology ', ' gastrointestinal disorder ', ' Gastrointestinal Diseases and Manifestations ', ' Gastrointestinal Diseases ', ' gastrointestinal bleeding ', ' GI hemorrhage ', ' GI bleeding ', ' Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Infection ', ' Inpatients ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Medical Informatics ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Noise ', ' Penicillin Antibiotics ', ' Penicillins ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United Kingdom ', ' Veterans ', ' C.difficile ', ' C. difficile ', ' C. diff ', ' C difficile ', ' C diff ', ' Clostridium difficile ', ' Generations ', ' Antiplatelet Agents ', ' Antiplatelet Drugs ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Pharmacoepidemiology ', ' pharmacoepidemiological ', ' pharmacoepidemiologic ', ' drug epidemiology ', ' Pharmaceutical Epidemiology ', ' Evaluation ', ' insight ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Development Plans ', ' Funding ', ' beta-Lactams ', ' β-Lactams ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Computational Biology ', ' computer biology ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Informatics ', ' skills ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' research study ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' career development ', ' Genomics ', ' Fluoroquinolones ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Master of Science ', ' National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ', ' NIDDK ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' Outcome ', ' usability ', ' clinical epidemiology ', ' Big Data to Knowledge ', ' BD2K ', ' econometrics ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K08,2019,169440,PA-03,0.18851757666298433
"Personalized Patient data and behavioral nudges to improve adherence to chronic cardiovascular medications Abstract Our objective in this project is to employ population level pharmacy data and delivery of nudges via cell phone text messaging and artificially intelligent (AI) interactive chat bot to improve medication adherence and patient outcomes in 3 integrated healthcare delivery systems (HCS): University of Colorado Health System (UCHealth), VA Eastern Colorado Health Care System (VA), and Denver Health Medical Center (DH). We will identify patients with chronic cardiovascular (CV) conditions taking medications to treat hypertension, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, diabetes and/or hyperlipidemia. We will leverage pharmacy refill data to identify episodes of non-adherence through gaps in medication refills and randomize individuals to 1 of 4 study arms when they have a first refill gap: 1) usual care; 2) generic text message reminder; 3) tailored and engaging text messages optimized to facilitate behavior change; or 4) optimized text messages plus a pre- programmed AI interactive chat bot designed to support identification and resolution of barriers to medication refill and adherence. In the UG3 phase (year 1), we will develop and program a theoretically informed technology-based (a) text message library and (b) chat bot content library using multiple and iterative N of 1 within subject studies to optimize content for a range of diverse patients. These outcomes will inform a pilot intervention to demonstrate feasibility of delivering the intervention and preliminary effects in all 3 HCS. We will also engage patient, provider and health systems stakeholders in designing, refining, and implementing the pilot intervention. In the UH3 phase (years 2-5), we will conduct a pragmatic patient-level randomized intervention across 3 HCS to improve adherence to chronic CV medications. We will evaluate the intervention using a mixed methods approach and apply the RE-AIM (reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance) framework. In addition, we will assess the context and implementation processes to inform local tailoring, adaptations and modifications, and eventual expansion of the intervention. Project Narrative Given the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases that require ongoing treatment with medications, the problem of medication non-adherence is unlikely to go away and will grow. This study will employ population level pharmacy data to identify non-adherent patients and utilize ubiquitous cell phone technology to send them tailored, engaging and motivating text messages and text message based chat through an artificially intelligent (AI) interactive chat bot to improve cardiac medication adherence and patient outcomes in 3 integrated healthcare delivery systems. This study will advance medication adherence research and the intervention could be applied to multiple clinical conditions requiring medications for long term treatment and other NIH institutes.!",Personalized Patient data and behavioral nudges to improve adherence to chronic cardiovascular medications,9986013,UH3HL144163,"['Adoption ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Atrial Fibrillation ', ' Auricular Fibrillation ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Colorado ', ' Coronary Arteriosclerosis ', ' Coronary Artery Disease ', ' Coronary Artery Disorder ', ' Coronary Atherosclerosis ', ' atherosclerotic coronary disease ', ' coronary arterial disease ', ' Decision Making ', ' health care delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health services delivery ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' promoting health ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hyperlipidemia ', ' Hyperlipemia ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Institutes ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Libraries ', ' Maintenance ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity -

"Prediction of Anti-Cancer Medication Discontinuation via Patient Portal Messages and Structured Electronic Medical Records Summary Cancer is a leading cause of morbidity in the United States, with more than half a million deaths estimated in 2019. Systemic cancer therapies are increasingly being designed as long-term oral anti-cancer medications, given the increased convenience of a self-administered regimen. For instance, patients with operable hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer are prescribed adjuvant oral hormonal therapy, with an expectation that they continue their regimen for a minimum of 5 years to maximize the benefits. Although many oral therapies have proven effective in mitigating cancer recurrence and mortality, discontinuation to these treatments are not uncommon. This is a concern because medication discontinuation before the completion of a prescribed treatment protocol leads to lower survival rates, increased risks of recurrence, and higher healthcare costs. To improve treatment adherence and promise better healthcare delivery, it is essential for healthcare providers to know when and why a cancer patient will discontinue their medications. While there have been various investigations into regimen discontinuation, the focus of these studies is either on knowledge discovery or intervention. While knowledge discovery focuses on characterizing the potential factors that lead to medication discontinuation, intervention aims to leverage discovered knowledge to design and test effective strategies to help patients adhere to treatments. Because there are thousands of cancer patients, it is impossible for healthcare providers to apply intervention to each of them. Limited medical resources need to be allocated efficiently, such that patients with a higher risk of discontinuing medications will receive greater, timely attention. Yet, the increasing integration of online communication and mobile computing technologies into the healthcare domain are generating massive quantities of patient-generated information. Thus, we propose to apply online patient-provider communications in a patient portal to supplement traditional EMR data to better understand a cancer patient’s medical experience. The central hypothesis of this project is that such communications together with structured EMRs can be applied to learn and forecast oral anti-cancer medication discontinuation. The specific aims of this project designed to test our central hypothesis are to 1) discover what has been communicated in a patient portal; 2) infer how patient portal messages and structured EMRs are associated with medication discontinuation; and 3) determine who are more likely to discontinue medications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply the messages in a patient portal and structured EMRs to investigate medication discontinuation for cancer patients. Project Narrative Many oral anti-cancer medications have proven effective in preventing cancer recurrence and mortality, however, treatment adherence to these oral medications, some of which are taken for years, can be challenging for cancer patients due to a variety of factors, including side effects and high costs. Since medication discontinuation can lead to lower survival rates, increased risk of recurrence, and higher healthcare costs, society will benefit from gaining a deeper understanding of the causes of medication discontinuation and knowing who are at a high risk of medication discontinuation. In this project, we will analyze the online communications between patients and healthcare providers in a patient portal and apply them as well as structured electronic medical records to predict medication discontinuation.",Prediction of Anti-Cancer Medication Discontinuation via Patient Portal Messages and Structured Electronic Medical Records,9954467,R37CA237452,"['Academic Medical Centers ', ' University Medical Centers ', ' Attention ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Sampling Biases ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Communication ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' health care delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health services delivery ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Probability ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Self Administration ', ' Self-Administered ', ' Semantics ', ' Societies ', ' Sociology ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Supervision ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' human subject ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service use ', ' healthcare service use ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' Oncology ', ' Endocrine Therapy ', ' Hormonal Therapy ', ' hormone therapy ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Oral ', ' Test Result ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' expectation ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Human Nature ', ' Human Characteristics ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' cancer recurrence ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' cancer therapy ', ' discovery mining ', ' literature mining ', ' literature searching ', ' text mining ', ' text searching ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Patient Compliance ', ' patient adherence ', ' patient cooperation ', ' therapy compliance ', ' therapy cooperation ', ' treatment compliance ', ' compliance behavior ', ' Data ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Process ', ' Adjuvant ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Consumption ', ' social learning theory ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' high risk ', ' electronic structure ', ' treatment adherence ', ' Regimen ', ' Knowledge Discovery ', ' mobile platform ', ' mobile technology ', ' mobile computing ', ' healthcare research ', ' Health Care Research ', ' recruit ', ' short message service ', ' texting ', ' Text Messaging ', ' patient-doctor communication ', ' patient-provider communication ', ' patient-clinician communication ', ' patient engagement ', ' patient portal ', ' anticancer ', ' anti-cancer ', ' hormone receptor-positive ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' side effect ', ' ']",NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R37,2020,402913,TN-05,0.18206155184012657
"The Adherence Promotion with Person-centered Technology (APPT) Project: Promoting Adherence to Enhance the Early Detection and Treatment of Cognitive Decline Many older adults experience declines in cognitive ability that can be substantial, including mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease and AD-related dementia. Population aging, coupled with age-related cognitive impairment, including Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias, represents an unprecedented challenge. Early detection of cognitive impairment is a crucial goal. This would allow individuals at risk for mild cognitive impairment and/or AD/ADRD to adopt lifestyle changes to minimize decrements and the risk for acquired cognitive impairment. However, the massive potential of cognitive training and longitudinal assessment to detect and prevent age-related cognitive impairment and dementia are unlikely to be realized unless individuals are willing and able to engage with these protocols for an extended period of time. Adherence to cognitive assessment and training is often poor. Addressing the gap between potential and realized benefits of early detection and prevention of cognitive impairment is an urgent goal as the population ages. The aims of the Adherence Promotion with Person-centered Technology (APPT) project are to promote early detection and treatment of age-related cognitive impairment and dementia by 1) enhancing adherence to cognitive intervention and assessment protocols, 2) improving understanding of barriers to long-term adherence, and 3) assisting in the development of algorithms for predicting and preventing adherence failures. Projects aim to investigate these issues within samples of older adults with and without cognitive impairment. Two randomized controlled trials will test an adaptive, tailored, and integrated technology support system predicted to boost adherence to cognitive protocols, over and above a simpler scheduling and reminder system over 6 months. Studies will provide valuable and generalizable insight into not only the benefits of adherence support, but also the individual difference factors that shape protocol adherence (e.g., attitudes, cognitive ability, dementia status, health status, personality, technology proficiency). Data will inform the process of identifying individuals who would benefit from additional support, and predicting and preventing extended adherence failures before they happen. By increasing adherence, these studies will help improve early detection and treatment of cognitive impairment, which will ultimately extend older adults' functional independence, improving their lives and the lives of their families, and reducing care and support resources needed to address lost independence like that associated with Alzheimer’s disease and AD-related dementia. Further, intervention studies for dementia and Alzheimer’s disease can be made more efficient through tools for identifying individuals likely to experience decline before substantial cognitive impairment has occurred. Results have implications that extend far beyond cognitive impairment; the methods and mechanisms uncovered have broad implications for technology-mediated assessment and protocols to enhance health and well-being in general. The project consists of two large randomized controlled trials and smaller needs assessment and usability studies that will guide their development and deployment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The aims of the Adherence Promotion with Person-centered Technology (APPT) project are to promote early detection and treatment of age-related cognitive impairment and dementia. This project will develop Artificial Intelligence-based reminder systems to help ensure long-term engagement to home-based cognitive assessment and cognitive training protocols to be able to detect and treat cognitive impairment as soon as possible.",The Adherence Promotion with Person-centered Technology (APPT) Project: Promoting Adherence to Enhance the Early Detection and Treatment of Cognitive Decline,9986599,R01AG064529,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Attitude ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cognition ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Interview ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Methods ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Personality ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Weight ', ' Measures ', ' Reminder Systems ', ' Mediating ', ' Schedule ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Age-associated cognitive decline ', ' Age-related cognitive decline ', ' Benign senescent forgetfulness ', ' age associated memory decline ', ' age related cognitive deficit ', ' age related cognitive impairment ', ' age related memory dysfunction ', ' Age-associated memory impairment ', ' Adopted ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' preference ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Social Support System ', ' Support System ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' cognitive change ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cognitive training ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' next generation ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Population ', ' Cognitive aging ', ' Individual Differences ', ' Coupled ', ' early therapy ', ' Early treatment ', ' person centered ', ' usability ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy design ', ' aged population ', ' population aging ', ' aging population ', ' public health relevance ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' cognitive performance ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive ability ', ' mobile platform ', ' mobile technology ', ' mobile computing ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' functional independence ', ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' behavior adherence ', ' behavioral adherence ', ' algorithm development ', ' smart algorithm ', ' intelligent algorithm ', ' ']",NIA,FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,692873,FL-05,0.07327332117048485
"Multi-modal Health Information Technology Innovations for Precision Management of Glaucoma PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Glaucoma is the world's leading cause of irreversible blindness and will affect >110 million people by 2040. Early detection and treatment are critical, as symptoms typically do not present until the disease is advanced. A data-driven precision medicine approach is needed to better identify individuals who are at greatest risk of developing the disease and who are at greatest risk of progressing quickly to vision loss. While there has been considerable progress in eye imaging and testing to improve glaucoma monitoring, precision management of glaucoma is incomplete without accounting for patients' co-existing systemic conditions, concurrent systemic medications and treatments, and adherence with prescribed glaucoma treatment. Understanding how systemic conditions, and specifically vascular conditions such as hypertension, impact glaucoma presents growing public health importance given the increasing co-morbidities facing aging populations. Preliminary studies have demonstrated the predictive value of systemic data, even without ophthalmic endpoints. Similarly, measuring medication adherence is important for guiding patient counseling and engagement and avoiding downstream interventions such as surgeries, which carry high cost and morbidity. These factors are important for providing a more comprehensive perspective of glaucoma management and for improving patient outcomes, yet they are relatively understudied. I propose applying multi-modal advancements in health information technology (IT) to address these gaps and achieve the following specific aims: (1) Develop machine learning-based predictive models classifying patients at risk for glaucoma progression using systemic electronic health record (EHR) data from a diverse nationwide patient cohort; (2) evaluate how integrating blood pressure (BP) data from novel smartwatch-based home BP monitors enhance predictive models for risk stratification in glaucoma, and (3) measure glaucoma medication adherence using innovative flexible electronic sensors to validate their use for future interventions aimed at improving adherence and clinical outcomes in glaucoma. These studies would leverage state- of-the-art methods in big-data predictive modeling as well as cutting-edge advancements in sensor technologies. This multi-faceted approach will build a foundation for a health IT framework geared toward improving risk stratification and generating novel therapeutic targets for glaucoma patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE A precision medicine approach is critical for early detection and treatment of glaucoma, an insidious chronic eye disease that can lead to blindness and severely decreased quality of life. The relationship between systemic conditions and treatments with glaucoma progression, as well as methods for monitoring and promoting glaucoma medication adherence, represent areas of glaucoma management that are not well-understood and are thus critical opportunities for technology-driven interventions.

"Optimizing Just-in-Time Adaptive Intervention to Improve Dietary Adherence in Behavioral Obesity Treatment: A Micro-randomized Trial PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Behavioral obesity treatment produces clinically significant weight loss and reduced disease risk/severity for many individuals with overweight/obesity and cardiovascular disease. Yet, about half of patients fall short of expected outcomes, which can be largely attributed to lapses from the recommended diet. Our work has shown that dietary lapses (specific instances of nonadherence to dietary goals) are frequent during weight loss attempts (~3-4 times per week), associated with poorer weight losses, and triggered by momentary changing states (e.g., changes in mood or availability of palatable food). Thus, there is a clear need for innovative solutions that can provide dynamic in-the-moment interventions to improve adherence to the prescribed diet in obesity treatment. Our research team was the first to develop a smartphone-based just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI) that includes: 1) daily ecological momentary assessment (EMA; repeated sampling via mobile device) of relevant behavioral, psychological, and environmental triggers for lapse; 2) a machine learning algorithm that uses information gathered via EMA to determine real-time lapse risk; & 3) delivery of brief intervention during high-risk moments. Our pilot work revealed that the JITAI was feasible, acceptable, and produced reductions in average lapse frequency. However, we have not yet shown a direct effect of the JITAI on eating behavior in the moment of heightened lapse risk and know little about the types of interventions that are most effective for reducing lapse. We therefore propose to extend our research via a micro- randomized trial (MRT), a methodology that involves random assignment to intervention (or control) at a specific decision point, i.e., when our algorithm predicts heightened risk for a lapse. The MRT will determine whether a specific intervention in a specific moment had its intended effect. We will therefore port our JITAI to a more scalable online platform and conduct a MRT to evaluate the effects of a generic lapse risk alert message and theory-driven just-in-time interventions on dietary lapses. After refinement testing with n=15 to ensure proper technical functioning of our updated JITAI, adults with overweight/obesity (n=159) will participate in a well-established 12-week online obesity treatment program + JITAI, with 12 weeks of JITAI-only follow-up. When an individual is at risk for lapsing s/he will be randomized to no intervention, a generic risk alert, or one of 4 theory-driven interventions with interactive skills training. The outcome of interest will be the occurrence (or lack thereof) of dietary lapse, as measured both subjectively (i.e., via EMA) and objectively (i.e., via wrist- based intake monitoring), in the hours following randomization. Results of the MRT will inform an optimized algorithm for intervention delivery that will drive the finalized JITAI. A future RCT will compare weight loss in obesity treatment with and without the optimized JITAI. This highly innovative approach will advance the science of adherence by supporting the development of sophisticated theoretical models of adherence behavior and informing JITAIs that target adherence to other health behaviors (e.g., medication, activity goals). PROJECT NARRATIVE This project targets dietary lapses (specific instances of nonadherence to dietary goals), a major cause of poor outcomes during behavioral obesity treatment, which is recommended as a first-line intervention for cardiovascular disease. We propose to conduct a micro-randomized trial to empirically optimize a just-in-time adaptive intervention that monitors risk and intervenes on lapses as needed. By evaluating the immediate, proximal effect of four theory-driven interventions on lapse behavior, the project will: (a) produce a scalable, finalized JITAI that has the greatest potential to show clear clinical impact in future RCTs and pragmatic trials; and (b) inform the development of more sophisticated theoretical models of adherence behavior more broadly.",Optimizing Just-in-Time Adaptive Intervention to Improve Dietary Adherence in Behavioral Obesity Treatment: A Micro-randomized Trial,10029156,R01HL153543,"['theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Intake ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Update ', ' Monitor ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' Text ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pilot trial ', ' obesity treatment ', ' Outcome ', ' Eating Behavior ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinically significant ', ' mobile device ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' high risk ', ' pragmatic effectiveness trial ', ' pragmatic trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' diet adherence ', ' dietary adherence ', ' behavior adherence ', ' behavioral adherence ', ' adaptive intervention ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Algorithms ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' Body Weight Changes ', ' Weight Change ', ' Energy Intake ', ' Caloric Intake ', ' caloric dietary content ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Health behavior ', ' Methodology ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Moods ', ' Motivation ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulentia ', ' obese ', ' obese people ', ' obese person ', ' obese population ', ' Patients ', ' Psychological Factors ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Suggestion ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Weight decreased ', ' Weight Loss ', ' Weight Reduction ', ' body weight loss ', ' wt-loss ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Wrist ', ' Measures ', ' falls ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Nutrition Interventions ', ' Nutritional Interventions ', ' diet intervention ', ' Dietary Intervention ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Hour ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Location ', ' Over weight ', ' Overweight ', ' interest ', ' skills training ', ' experience ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' treatment program ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Palate ', ' brief therapy ', ' brief treatment ', ' brief intervention ', ' Sampling ', ' ']",NHLBI,MIRIAM HOSPITAL,R01,2020,727923,RI-01,0.11331089462467185
"Evaluation of multiple medication exposures concurrently using a novel algorithm PROJECT SUMMARY The development of large observational health databases (OHD) has expanded the data available for analysis by pharmacoepidemiology research. The efficiency of these studies may be improved by simultaneously studying the association of multiple medications with a disease of interest. Unfortunately, prior research has demonstrated that it is difficult to distinguish true-positive from false-positive results when studying multiple exposures simultaneously, thus limiting the conclusions drawn from these types of studies and representing a major gap in the field. The objective of this proposal, which is the first step in achieving the applicant's long- term goal of improving the diagnosis and treatment of gastrointestinal diseases using insights derived from OHD, is to evaluate and validate medication class enrichment analysis (MCEA), a novel set-based signal-to- noise enrichment algorithm developed by the applicant to analyze multiple exposures from OHD with high sensitivity and specificity. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that MCEA has equal sensitivity and greater specificity compared to logistic regression, the most widely used analytic method for OHD, for identifying true associations between medications and clinical outcomes. The applicant will complete the following two interrelated specific aims to test the hypothesis: Aim 1 – to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of medication class enrichment analysis (MCEA) and logistic regression (LR) for identifying medication associations with Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and Aim 2 – to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of MCEA and LR for identifying medication associations with gastrointestinal hemorrhage (GIH). The rationale for these aims is that by reproducing known medication-disease associations without false positives, MCEA can be used to identify novel pharmacologic associations with gastrointestinal diseases in future studies. The expected outcome for the proposed research is that it will demonstrate MCEA as a valid method for pharmacoepidemiology research, opening new research opportunities for the study of multi-exposure OHD. These new research opportunities may lead to more rapid identification of potential pharmacologic causes of emerging diseases and discovery of unanticipated beneficial medication effects, allowing such medications to be repurposed for new indications. To attain the expected outcome, the applicant will complete additional coursework that builds on his Master of Science in Clinical Epidemiology to learn computational biology, machine learning, and econometrics techniques. With the support of this grant and his institution, he will also directly apply these techniques to pharmacoepidemiology applications under the close mentorship of a carefully selected team of faculty with extensive experience in gastroenterology, pharmacoepidemiology, medical informatics, and mentoring prior K-award grant recipients. Through these activities, the applicant will develop the skills necessary to obtain NIH R01-level funding and become a leader in developing novel techniques for application to the epidemiologic study of gastrointestinal diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE Traditionally, research studying medications associated with diseases are limited to analyzing one medication at a time. This novel proposal will validate medication class enrichment analysis, a recently developed algorithm to study multiple medications simultaneously for association with a disease of interest. Validation of this method will allow researchers to use existing medical databases to more rapidly identify potential medication causes of emerging diseases and identify medications with unanticipated beneficial effects, allowing such medications to be repurposed for new indications.",Evaluation of multiple medication exposures concurrently using a novel algorithm,9853783,K08DK119475,"['Algorithms ', ' Aminoglycosides ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents ', ' NSAIDs ', ' Non Steroidal Antiinflammatory Agents ', ' Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents ', ' Nonsteroidal Antiinflammatory Agents ', ' Nonsteroidal Antiinflammatory Drug ', ' non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ', ' non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs ', ' nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Anticoagulants ', ' Anticoagulant Agents ', ' Anticoagulant Drugs ', ' blood thinner ', ' thrombopoiesis inhibitor ', ' Carbapenems ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Cephalosporins ', ' Charge ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Digestive System Disorders ', ' Digestive Diseases ', ' Digestive System Diseases ', ' GI tract disorder ', ' digestive disorder ', ' digestive tract disease ', ' gastrointestinal tract disease ', ' gastrointestinal tract disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Epidemiologic Methods ', ' Epidemiological Methods ', ' Epidemiological Techniques ', ' Methods Epidemiology ', ' Faculty ', ' Future ', ' Gastroenterology ', ' Gastrointestinal Diseases ', ' gastrointestinal disorder ', ' Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage ', ' GI bleeding ', ' GI hemorrhage ', ' gastrointestinal bleeding ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Infection ', ' Inpatients ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Medical Informatics ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Noise ', ' Penicillins ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United Kingdom ', ' Veterans ', ' Clostridium difficile ', ' C diff ', ' C difficile ', ' C. diff ', ' C. difficile ', ' Clostridioides difficile ', ' Generations ', ' Antiplatelet Agents ', ' Antiplatelet Drugs ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Pharmaceutical Epidemiology ', ' drug epidemiology ', ' pharmacoepidemiologic ', ' pharmacoepidemiological ', ' Pharmacoepidemiology ', ' Evaluation ', ' insight ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Development Plans ', ' Funding ', ' β-Lactams ', ' beta-Lactams ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' computer biology ', ' Computational Biology ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Informatics ', ' skills ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' research study ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' career development ', ' Genomics ', ' Fluoroquinolones ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Master of Science ', ' NIDDK ', ' National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' K-Awards ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' Outcome ', ' usability ', ' clinical epidemiology ', ' BD2K ', ' Big Data to Knowledge ', ' econometrics ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K08,2020,167900,PA-03,0.18851757666298433
"Machine Learning to Reduce Hypertension Treatment Clinical Inertia PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Hypertension (HTN) is a main risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). It can be managed through use of antihypertensive medications and lifestyle modification (i.e., diet and exercise). Adults who have controlled BP have close to a 50% decreased risk of CVD-related mortality compared to those with uncontrolled BP. However, using current guidelines, over 40% of the 100 million US adults with HTN have controlled BP. Thus, uncontrolled BP remains a significant and largely unchecked public health issue in the United States. Interventions to improve BP control exist (i.e., medication adherence and diet and exercise), but they are mostly complex and resource intensive. If resources to improve HTN control are to be efficiently used, identifying patients who are likely to have persistently uncontrolled BP may provide an opportunity for targeted and tailored intervention and close monitoring. Application of a machine learning algorithm (MLA) to electronic medical record (EMR) data could identify patients likely to have uncontrolled BP. The use and amount of data in EMRs continues to expand and improve in quality. The Temple Health EMR contains extensive demographic, clinical, prescribing, and dispensing data. MLAs are ideally suited to harness this complex and abundant data. MLAs recognize patterns in data that may be difficult to detect by researchers and identify variables that are important for prediction of an outcome. They have been used to predict hospital length of stay, hospital mortality rates, and even detect diabetic retinopathy. The objective of the major study proposed in this K01 application is to first, develop and validate a random forest MLA to predict risk of uncontrolled BP among adults with HTN. Second, identify barriers and facilitators to implementing an MLA-clinical decision support (CDS) tool that predicts uncontrolled BP into clinical settings by conducting key-informant interviews and focus groups with primary care clinicians and patients. Third, Compare clinical management of hypertension with and without a prototype of an MLA-CDS tool through a case-vignette study. These aims align with my career goal of lowering CVD risk in adults. I will accomplish these aims with the help of an accomplished mentoring team focused on hypertension and antihypertensive medication adherence, machine learning, and qualitative interviewing and CDS-tool development. During the timeframe of this study I will gain experience in (1) MLA development and validation, (2) qualitative interviewing skills to develop CDS tools for clinicians, and (3) leadership skills for principal investigators. These skills will allow me to become an independent investigator focused on identifying people at high risk for chronic disease related to CVD events and developing tools to assist physicians in lowering CVD risk at the population level. The objective of the major study proposed in this K01 application is to first, develop and validate a random forest machine learning algorithm (MLA) to predict risk of uncontrolled blood pressure among adults with hypertension. Second, identify barriers and facilitators to implementing an MLA-clinical decision support (CDS) tool that predicts uncontrolled blood pressure into clinical settings by conducting key-informant interviews and focus groups with primary care clinicians and patients.

"QT prolonging medications and sudden cardiac death among individuals on hemodialysis PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT Individuals receiving maintenance hemodialysis (HD) have exceedingly high mortality, driven largely by cardiovascular events. The rate of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in the HD population exceeds that of the general population by more than 20-fold. Risk factors for SCD such as structural heart disease and conduction abnormalities are common among people with end-stage kidney disease, but traditional preventive strategies, such as antiarrhythmic medications and implantable cardioverter defibrillators, do not lower SCD risk in HD patients. However, medication-provoked SCD may be preventable, and, to-date, has been understudied in HD patients. Dialysis patients are often prescribed medications that have the undesirable, off-target effect of delayed ventricular repolarization, which manifests as QT-interval prolongation on an electrocardiogram, and can trigger fatal arrhythmias. Although more than 50% of dialysis patients are prescribed medications that can prolong the QT-interval (e.g. certain antidepressants, antibiotics, antiemetics), there are critical knowledge gaps about the cardiac safety of these medications. In fact, their safety profiles rest on data obtained from healthy volunteers and have not been explicitly evaluated in HD patients. By executing the proposed studies, we will provide a comprehensive understanding of the essential safety data relevant to the prescription of non- cardiac QT-prolonging medications to HD patients. In Aim 1, we will determine the relative SCD risk of the most commonly prescribed non-cardiac medications with higher QT-prolonging potential vs. clinically relevant comparator medications with lower QT-prolonging potential among HD patients. In Aim 2, we will identify modifiable clinical factors (e.g. dialysate composition and concurrent prescription medications) that may be targeted to mitigate SCD risk from QT-prolonging medications. In Aim 3, we will identify prescribers of higher risk QT-prolonging medications and associated encounters that should prompt medication reconciliation and decision support tool use. Then, in Aim 4, we will develop individualized decision support tools for QT- prolonging medication prescribing that integrate many comorbid conditions, HD treatment, and medication- related risk factors. This work will yield decision support tools that facilitate personalized SCD risk assessments and safer prescribing of QT-prolonging medications to reduce SCD risk among HD patients. Moreover, the decision support tools generated in this project will serve as the subject of future pragmatic trials testing the impact of tool implementation on cardiovascular outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Hemodialysis patients experience a disproportionately high burden of sudden cardiac death. Medication- provoked sudden cardiac death (i.e. death triggered by QT-prolonging medications) may be preventable and has not been studied enough in this population.

"Development of a novel medication adherability tool to improve cardiovascular disease management Nearly half of patients with heart disease become non-adherent to their prescribed therapies within a year of treatment initiation. This is a central and modifiable reason why cardiovascular disease remains a leading cause of death in the US. Despite numerous attempts to develop interventions aimed at improving adherence, these attempts have had varying and often limited success; one explanation could be that underlying barriers to adherence are not being addressed. Those interventions that have been successful often make medications easier to take but are frequently expensive to implement or deployed too late. Developing a novel provider- facing intervention that modifies medication “adherability”, defined as the properties of medications that make them difficult for patients to take, could be especially impactful and relatively inexpensive. For example, more than 30% of patients report difficulties swallowing prescribed medicines, yet little is known how this “adherability” affects long-term adherence and clinical outcomes, and few interventions focus on these issues.  To this end, Dr. Lauffenburger’s K01 proposal incorporates a novel prophylactic, patient-centric approach to provider behavior change for cardiovascular disease management. Providers often do not know what the medications they prescribe actually look like or what aspects of the medications are acceptable to or preferred by their patients. This study will uniquely incorporate patient perspectives about medication properties that lead to poor adherence in the design of a scalable provider-facing clinical decision support intervention.  The proposed aims are to: (1) develop a comprehensive framework of cardiovascular medication properties, such as appearance, side-effect profiles, or dosing, that may lead to poor adherence using patient focus groups; (2) rigorously evaluate their effects on adherence and clinical outcomes in large national data sources; (3) develop and externally validate a novel clinical prediction rule for medication adherability; and (4) develop and pilot test novel web- and electronic health record-based prescribing tools based on the prediction rule for providers. The expected overall impact of this innovative proposal is that it will fundamentally advance how to personalize medications for patients to ultimately improve adherence and health outcomes.  Dr. Lauffenburger has a unique background as a practicing pharmacist trained in epidemiology with a proven commitment to research. This proposal includes an educational plan that will address gaps in her training: expertise in behavioral sciences, prediction modeling, and implementation research. The mentorship team, led by Niteesh Choudhry, an expert in adherence and implementation, includes well-known experts in cardiovascular trials (Elliott Antman, co-mentor), biostatistics (Robert Glynn, co-mentor), and behavioral sciences (Daniel Solomon, co-mentor), and will ensure scientific success and training. By the conclusion of this program, she will be able to independently design, target, and evaluate behavioral interventions for heart diseases. The results of the proposed K01 will be invaluable pilot work for a planned R01-level application. We propose a novel strategy to address the epidemic of poor adherence to cardiovascular therapies: tailoring medications for vulnerable patients based on their “adherability”, or the properties of medication like dosing frequency, palatability, and side-effect profiles, that make them difficult to take regularly. To achieve the proposed research, we will conduct focus groups with at-risk patients, determine the effect of adherability on long-term adherence and cardiovascular outcomes, develop and validate a novel adherability clinical prediction rule, and pilot test a simple, scalable clinical decision support tool for providers. The overarching goal is to improve clinical outcomes by optimizing medications for patients at the time of prescribing, which is a central mission of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI).",Development of a novel medication adherability tool to improve cardiovascular disease management,9886260,K01HL141538,"['Affect ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Color ', ' Data Sources ', ' Decision Making ', ' Deglutition ', ' Swallowing ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Epidemic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' mortality ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacists ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Internet ', ' Review Literature ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Disease Management ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Frequencies ', ' prophylactic ', ' Route ', ' behavior change ', ' success ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Appearance ', ' Palate ', ' health-related belief ', ' health belief ', ' Property ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' drug adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' medication adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' systematic review ', ' NHLBI ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' implementation research ', ' virtual ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' Consumption ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' successful intervention ', ' Regimen ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' customized therapy ', ' customized treatment ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' individualized therapy ', ' individualized treatment ', ' patient specific therapies ', ' patient specific treatment ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' tailored therapy ', ' tailored treatment ', ' unique treatment ', ' individualized medicine ', ' support tools ', ' individual patient ', ' clinical decision support ', ' cardiometabolic ', ' cardiometabolism ', ' side effect ', ' ']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K01,2020,143581,MA-07,0.26191630619579964
