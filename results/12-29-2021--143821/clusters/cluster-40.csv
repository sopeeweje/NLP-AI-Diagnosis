"The Role of the Microbiome in the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K23 proposal will complete Robert Dickson, MD's training towards his long-term career goal of improving our understanding and treatment of lung disease by investigation of the microbiome. Dr. Dickson is a Pulmonary and Critical Care physician and scientist at the University of Michigan with established success in the burgeoning field of lung microbiome studies. This proposal builds on Dr. Dickson's previously acquired expertise in pulmonary pathophysiology and microbial ecology with new training in clinical research methods and computational biology. These established and newly-acquired skills will be integrated to improve our understanding of the role of the microbiome in the pathogenesis of the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). This research will be conducted under the guidance of primary mentor Gary B. Huffnagle PhD, co- mentor Theodore J. Standiford MD and an advisory board of accomplished investigators with expertise in clinical research methods, computational biology and lung immunology as well as extensive mentoring success. This 5-year plan includes formal coursework, professional development, and progressively independent research, with defined milestones to ensure productivity and a successful transition to independence. The Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a major cause of morbidity, mortality and expense, responsible for an estimated 74,500 U.S. deaths per year. Numerous studies have identified indirect evidence of translocation of bacteria from the gastrointestinal tract to the lung in patients at risk for ARDS, but to date no study has evaluated the role of microbiome in the pathogenesis of ARDS. This proposal will test the hypothesis that translocation of gut bacteria to the lung provokes the inflammation and injury of ARDS via two specific Scientific Aims. Aim 1 will determine if translocation of enteric bacteria to the lung microbiome precedes the clinical development of ARDS, and Aim 2 will determine the temporal relationship between respiratory dysbiosis, host inflammation and the clinical onset of ARDS. Inherent to completing these high-level aims, Dr. Dickson will execute a prospective cohort study of patients at high risk for ARDS, utilize modern culture-independent techniques of bacterial identification to describe the bacterial communities in the lungs and gastrointestinal tracts of high-risk patients, and apply novel techniques of advanced computational modeling to the complex nonlinear system of ARDS pathogenesis. This work will build to at least two R01 proposals: 1) to determine if the lung microbiome contributes to disease progression among patients with established ARDS and 2) to determine if the lung microbiome can be therapeutically manipulated in critically ill patients to prevent or modulate respiratory disease. n addition to building a foundation for a programmatic line of research to understand the role of the microbiome in lung disease, this proposal will provide Dr. Dickson with research skills applicable to additional domains of human microbiome and ARDS research. This K23 award will equip Dr. Dickson to establish himself as an independent investigator and international leader in this promising field.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a major cause of morbidity, mortality and expense, responsible for an estimated 74,500 U.S. deaths per year; the National Institutes of Health have identified the prevention and early treatment of ARDS as a research priority. We lack an understanding of the pathogenesis of ARDS, impeding our ability to predict and prevent its onset. Determination of the role of the microbiome in the pathogenesis of ARDS would both 1) improve our ability to predict the onset of ARDS, enabling targeted preventive interventions and 2) identify novel therapeutic targets at the microbiome/host interface in patients at risk for ARDS.        ",The Role of the Microbiome in the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome,9013900,K23HL130641,"['Bacteria ', ' Sympathins ', ' Catecholamines ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Critical Care ', ' Critically Ill ', ' Critical Illness ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Environmental Science ', ' Ecology ', ' Aerobacter ', ' Enterobacter ', ' Enterobacteria ', ' Enteric Bacteria ', ' Coliform Bacilli ', ' Enterobacteriaceae ', ' Therapeutic Epinephrine ', ' Adrenaline ', ' Epinephrine ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' digestive canal ', ' alimentary tract ', ' Gastrointestinal Tract ', ' GI Tract ', ' Digestive Tract ', ' Alimentary Canal ', ' Gastrointestinal tract structure ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Immigrations ', ' In-Migration ', ' indexing ', ' Inflammation ', ' Preinterleukin 1 Beta ', ' Interleukin-1β ', ' Interleukin 1beta ', ' IL1β ', ' IL1F2 ', ' IL1B Protein ', ' IL1-β ', ' IL1-Beta ', ' IL-1β ', ' IL-1-b ', ' IL-1 β ', ' IL-1 beta ', ' Beta Proprotein Interleukin 1 ', ' Interleukin-1 beta ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Lung ', ' lung disorder ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Lung diseases ', ' Mentors ', ' Michigan ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome after Isolated Traumatic Brain Injury: Platelet Biology, Endothelial Activation, and Mechanical Ventilation PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT This is an application for a K23 award for Dr. Carolyn Hendrickson, a pulmonary and critical care physician at the University of California, San Francisco. Dr. Hendrickson is establishing herself as a young investigator in patient-oriented research of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with a focus on the biologic mechanisms of ARDS after traumatic brain injury (TBI). This K23 award will provide Dr. Hendrickson with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become an expert clinical and translational researcher in ARDS after traumatic injury; (2) to study the biologic mechanisms of ARDS after TBI involving platelet biology, endothelial activation, and lung injury induced by mechanical ventilation; (3) to implement advanced analyses of complex observational data, including machine learning; (4) to develop an independent translational research career. Dr. Hendrickson's plan to achieve these goals is supported by a multidisciplinary mentoring team of experts. Her primary mentor, Dr. Michael Matthay, has extensive experience in translational ARDS research and in the career development of early stage investigators. Dr. Hendrickson will work with four co-mentors: Dr. Mitchell Cohen, a translational researcher studying coagulation after trauma, Dr. Alan Hubbard, a biostatistician specializing in causal inference, Dr. Geoffrey Manley, a neurosurgeon and leading investigator in TBI research, and Dr. Mark Looney, an expert platelet biology and lung injury. The development of ARDS after TBI is common and is associated with worse neurological outcomes. The biologic mechanisms driving ARDS after TBI are poorly understood. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the risk of ARDS after TBI is mediated through activated vascular endothelium and platelets as well as non-protective mechanical ventilation strategies that use large tidal volumes. Dr. Hendrickson will investigate these causal pathways utilizing previously collected data and plasma from an ongoing observational cohort study. In this same cohort she will prospectively collect biospecimens, detailed mechanical ventilation data, and lung ultrasound images. This proposal represents an innovative approach to studying ARDS after TBI using carefully adjudicated exposures and outcomes. Dr. Hendrickson will test whether plasma biomarkers of endothelial activation, vascular permeability, and inflammation (Aim 1) and platelet function, activation, and aggregation (Aim 2) are associated with ARDS after TBI. She will collect lung ultrasound images and frequent mechanical ventilation data including tidal volumes and plateau pressures. She will test whether early exposure to non-protective mechanical ventilation is associated with ARDS after TBI (Aim 3). Addressing this gap in knowledge may lead to interventions that prevent ARDS and improve outcomes in this patient population. The research and training outlined in this proposal will form the basis for an R01-level proposal designed to study interventions to prevent and treat ARDS after traumatic injury. Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because each year in the United States 1.7 million people sustain a Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and over 20% of patients with severe isolated TBI develop Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), a form of serious lung disease associated with poor neurological outcomes after TBI. Identification of biologic factors and mechanical ventilation parameters that contribute to ARDS pathogenesis after TBI is the first step in a continuum of research that will pave the way to prevention, personalized risk assessment, improved early management, and targeted treatments for ARDS in patients with TBI. Additionally, understanding the mechanisms of disease in this vulnerable population will expand the understanding of lung injury pathogenesis after a variety of traumatic injuries and perhaps in other high-risk populations.","Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome after Isolated Traumatic Brain Injury: Platelet Biology, Endothelial Activation, and Mechanical

"Rule Based Semantics and Big Data Based Methods for Early Identification of Patients at Risk of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) represent a major global public health problem, with an ICU incidence of 10.4% and an associated mortality rate of 35-45%. Early detection of ARDS is essential for appropriate application of Lung Protective Ventilation, the only therapeutic intervention demonstrated to improve mortality in mechanically ventilated patients with established ARDS. In response to this need, tools that electronically monitor ABG results and interpret radiology reports of CXR findings for evidence of ARDS criteria in mechanically ventilated patients have been developed and deployed in critical care settings. Although these tools have been sufficiently accurate to detect ARDS, they fail to detect early stages of disease progression, prior to full-blown ARDS development, in at risk patients. Recent initiatives are focused on tools to identify patients in very early stages of ARDS before wide-spread alveolar damage has occurred, enabling strategies focused on prevention of ARDS development. Among efforts to use EMR data to reliably identify patients at high risk of developing ARDS, the most notable are the Lung Injury Prediction Score (LIPS) and the “early acute lung injury” score (EALI). Validation studies show these promising tools have discriminating performance with an area under ROC curve (AUC) in the .7-.8 range, and demonstrate risk detection early in the course of illness, well in advance of frank respiratory failure. Our vision is to build on these efforts, and derive a highly automated early identification algorithm based on routinely captured medical record data that reliably and accurately identifies trajectories associated with post-exposure to specific classes of risk factors that predicts patients at risk for development of ARDS with an AUC discrimination in excess of .95. We believe the predictive performance of existing ARDS screening tools can be significantly improved by: 1) combined use of highly specific/sensitive cognitive/explanatory models to help guide machine learning by reducing “label noise” and identifying specific risk-induced trajectories associated with progression to ARDS; 2) exploring a full constellation of predictive risk factors not yet addressed by earlier efforts; 3) use of advanced natural language processing technology to extract ARDS risk information from free text clinical reports, and 4) use of enhanced machine learning algorithms that are label noise tolerant and combine the predictive power of nonparametric algorithms with the feature interpretability associated with parametric techniques. Despite advances in critical care medicine, mortality among patients with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) remains high, up to 45% for severe cases. There is no proven pharmacological treatment for ARDS; current treatment approaches focus on providing supportive care. Consequently, there is great community interest in targeted prevention of ARDS. The goal of this research is to develop and validate a highly predictive real-time ARDS surveillance software system that can be routinely used in hospitals to detect early stages of this syndrome, enabling interventions that can reduce the progression to full-blown disease. Our approach uses modern artificial intelligence techniques including cognitive reasoning, machine learning and natural language processing to dramatically reduce preventable ARDS mortality in hospitalized patients.",Rule Based Semantics and Big Data Based Methods for Early Identification of Patients at Risk of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS),9345675,R43HL135909,"['Algorithms ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Berlin ', ' Calibration ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Communities ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Critical Care ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Hospitals ', ' Hybrids ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lung ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Manuals ', ' Medical Records ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' mortality ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Noise ', ' Nurses ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Patients ', ' Pneumonia ', ' Public Health ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' Radiology ', ' General Radiology ', ' Research ', ' Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome ', ' wet lung ', ' Stiff lung ', ' Shock Lung ', ' Da Nang Lung ', ' Adult RDS ', ' Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ', ' ARDS ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' ROC Curve ', ' ROC Analyses ', ' Semantics ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Septic Shock ', ' Supervision ', ' Syndrome ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Thoracic Radiography ', ' thorax radiography ', ' thoracic radiogram ', ' radiographic lung image ', ' radiographic chest image ', ' lung radiography ', ' chest radiography ', ' chest Xray ', ' chest X ray ', ' CXR ', ' Time ', ' Ventilation ', ' Environmental air flow ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' Secondary to ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Measurement ', ' Acute Pulmonary Injury ', ' Acute Lung Injury ', ' Disease Progression ', ' lung injury ', ' disorder onset ', ' disease onset ', ' Onset of illness ', ' Immune response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' host response ', ' Immunological response ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Supportive care ', ' Supportive Therapy ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Consensus ', ' Mechanics ', ' mechanical ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' Performance ', ' diagnostic accuracy ', ' Accuracy of Diagnosis ', ' knowledge base ', ' knowledgebase ', ' validation studies ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Early identification ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Genetic Determinism ', ' genetic determinant ', ' ICD-9 ', ' Respiratory Failure ', ' respiratory insufficiency/failure ', ' pulmonary failure ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Alveolar ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Subgroup ', ' Clinical/Radiologic ', ' Cognitive ', ' Ontology ', ' Pharmacological Treatment ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' syndromic surveillance ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' software systems ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' bloodstream infection ', ' blood infection ', ' Sepsis ', ' Outcome ', ' comparative effectiveness ', ' high risk ', ' screening ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' Patient risk ', ' patient stratification ', ' stratified patient ', ' ']",NHLBI,"COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATES, INC.",R43,2017,149470,CA-23,0.5456035471487757

"TREAT ECARDS: Translating Evidence into Action: Electronic Clinical Decision Support in ARDS PROJECT SUMMARY With an associated mortality of 35%, Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) contributes to the morbidity and mortality seen in many acute conditions such as pneumonia, influenza, sepsis, trauma and aspiration. Yet studies consistently show that ARDS is under-recognized in up to 40% of patients with generally low and variable adoption of practices shown to improve mortality in ARDS. The overall goal of this proposed project is to improve care delivered to ARDS patients by promoting accurate identification of patients with ARDS and increasing adoption of evidence-based interventions shown to improve outcomes in ARDS. With the recent publication of a multi-professional Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) on mechanical ventilation in ARDS, this proposal specifically aims: 1) To increase identification of ARDS patients with an automated electronic tool (ARDS Sniffer 2.0) powered by the predictive analytics of machine learning algorithms and natural language processing. 2) To translate the recently published multi-professional Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) on mechanical ventilation in ARDS into an evidence-based, context-appropriate, Electronic Clinical decision support system in ARDS (ECARDS) for the management of ARDS. This process will be informed by an expert panel from the CPG committee as well as a semi-qualitative analysis of the cognitive decision making process, data needs and workflow of users in a series of Think-Aloud studies and focus group interviews. ARDS Sniffer 2.0, ECARDS and an ARDS Dashboard to show near real-time data on the incidence of ARDS and rate of utilization of best care will then be incorporated within the hospital EMR for useability testing with another series of Think-Aloud and semi-qualitative studies. 3) To evaluate the effectiveness of ARDS Sniffer 2.0, ARDS Dashboard, and ECARDS in a stepped-wedge, cluster randomized control trial of 3 hospitals within the Montefiore Healthcare System to increase utilization of recommended interventions in ARDS and improve outcomes. 4) To promote the dissemination of the clinical decision support system through our partner professional organizations of American Thoracic Society, Society of Critical Care Medicine, and American Association of Respiratory Care and Program for Emergency Preparedness. Because of the high pressure, high acuity, and rapidly changing status of the acutely ill ARDS patient, clinical decision making often defaults to the automated, pattern-driven cognitive processes which are particularly prone to unconscious biases and errors and cognitive overload from large volumes of shifting data. As such, this proposal is the ideal research demonstration project to develop a new clinical decision support tool that will harness the power of big data and predictive analytics to identify ARDS in the hospital and deliver an evidenced-based, expert and user informed clinical decision support tool to clinicians at the right point during their clinical interaction and workflow with these patients in order to promote the right interventions to the right patients at the right time. PROJECT NARRATIVE Even as Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome constitutes the most severe form of respiratory failure in the hospital with an associated mortality of 35%, it is consistently under-recognized and proven treatments are underutilized. This proposal aims to harness the power of big data in the hospital information system to identify patients with ARDS and prompt clinicians with the evidence-based best management of this condition. By developing a computerized decision support system whose design is informed by the experts and the clinicians themselves, this proposal aims to bring the right care to the right patient at the right time to save lives and promote recovery from this devastating condition.",TREAT ECARDS: Translating Evidence into Action: Electronic Clinical Decision Support in ARDS,9571335,R18HS026188,[''],AHRQ,"ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, INC",R18,2018,397326,NY-14,0.5332536000094062
"The Role of the Microbiome in the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K23 proposal will complete Robert Dickson, MD's training towards his long-term career goal of improving our understanding and treatment of lung disease by investigation of the microbiome. Dr. Dickson is a Pulmonary and Critical Care physician and scientist at the University of Michigan with established success in the burgeoning field of lung microbiome studies. This proposal builds on Dr. Dickson's previously acquired expertise in pulmonary pathophysiology and microbial ecology with new training in clinical research methods and computational biology. These established and newly-acquired skills will be integrated to improve our understanding of the role of the microbiome in the pathogenesis of the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). This research will be conducted under the guidance of primary mentor Gary B. Huffnagle PhD, co- mentor Theodore J. Standiford MD and an advisory board of accomplished investigators with expertise in clinical research methods, computational biology and lung immunology as well as extensive mentoring success. This 5-year plan includes formal coursework, professional development, and progressively independent research, with defined milestones to ensure productivity and a successful transition to independence. The Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a major cause of morbidity, mortality and expense, responsible for an estimated 74,500 U.S. deaths per year. Numerous studies have identified indirect evidence of translocation of bacteria from the gastrointestinal tract to the lung in patients at risk for ARDS, but to date no study has evaluated the role of microbiome in the pathogenesis of ARDS. This proposal will test the hypothesis that translocation of gut bacteria to the lung provokes the inflammation and injury of ARDS via two specific Scientific Aims. Aim 1 will determine if translocation of enteric bacteria to the lung microbiome precedes the clinical development of ARDS, and Aim 2 will determine the temporal relationship between respiratory dysbiosis, host inflammation and the clinical onset of ARDS. Inherent to completing these high-level aims, Dr. Dickson will execute a prospective cohort study of patients at high risk for ARDS, utilize modern culture-independent techniques of bacterial identification to describe the bacterial communities in the lungs and gastrointestinal tracts of high-risk patients, and apply novel techniques of advanced computational modeling to the complex nonlinear system of ARDS pathogenesis. This work will build to at least two R01 proposals: 1) to determine if the lung microbiome contributes to disease progression among patients with established ARDS and 2) to determine if the lung microbiome can be therapeutically manipulated in critically ill patients to prevent or modulate respiratory disease. n addition to building a foundation for a programmatic line of research to understand the role of the microbiome in lung disease, this proposal will provide Dr. Dickson with research skills applicable to additional domains of human microbiome and ARDS research. This K23 award will equip Dr. Dickson to establish himself as an independent investigator and international leader in this promising field. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a major cause of morbidity, mortality and expense, responsible for an estimated 74,500 U.S. deaths per year; the National Institutes of Health have identified the prevention and early treatment of ARDS as a research priority.

"Understanding Response Shift in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) survivors Project Summary / Abstract Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a severe lung injury usually requiring mechanical ventilation in an intensive care unit (ICU). While the number of ICU patients requiring mechanical ventilation is steadily increasing, in-hospital mortality is declining, creating a growing population of ARDS survivors. Such survivorship comes at a high “cost,” with ARDS patients frequently experiencing new or worsening physical, cognitive, and/or mental health impairments that last for years after ARDS. NHLBI and professional societies identify improving quality of life for ARDS survivors as a key research priority. Some ARDS survivors may adapt to new impairments over time and report improving quality of life not explained by improvements in objective measures of their physical, cognitive, and mental health. This adaptation phenomenon is known as “response shift.” We hypothesize that ARDS survivors demonstrate widely varying degrees of response shift, and that patients' baseline characteristics prior to ARDS have important associations with the magnitude of response shift after ICU discharge. We also investigate how psychosocial factors, including trait anxiety, social support, resilience, and survivor expectations for functional recovery, impact quality of life during recovery as a first step toward designing and evaluating new interventions for ARDS survivors.  This proposal will exploit a unique, pre-existing cohort of very well-characterized ARDS survivors from the NHLBI ARDS Network Long Term Outcome Study (ALTOS) containing hundreds of data elements per patient. Using modern data science methods, I will empirically evaluate the association between baseline patient characteristics and response shift between 6 and 12 months after ARDS [Aim 1], and identify the changes in specific aspects of physical, cognitive, and mental health, from among ~165 candidate measures, that best predict changes in quality of life [Aim 2]. To investigate how psychosocial factors impact quality of life, I will conduct a new, prospective, ICU cohort study of ARDS survivors to collect data for these novel analyses [Aim 3]. The results from these three Aims will generate new knowledge regarding empirically-derived, testable hypotheses about important determinants of quality of life, and provide essential data for designing future studies of interventions aimed at improving the quality of life of ARDS survivors.  This career development award provides training in data science, patient outcomes-oriented clinical research, and machine learning statistical techniques for the applicant who is a PhD-trained epidemiologist without these skills. Immediate, short-term, and long-term career goals include: (1) publishing results of the proposed research, (2) successfully competing for R-level funding to explore whether addressing psychosocial issues, including setting appropriate patient expectations for recovery, is a potentially modifiable, low-cost intervention to improve ARDS survivor's quality of life, and (3) becoming an NHLBI-funded independent research scientist who conducts innovative and methodologically rigorous data science research on ARDS outcomes. Project Narrative A large and growing number of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) survivors frequently experience new and long-lasting physical, cognitive, and mental health impairments. ARDS survivors may exhibit a phenomenon known as “response shift” in which survivors adapt to new impairments and report improving quality of life not explained by improvements in objective measures of their physical, cognitive, and mental health. Using a cohort of very well-characterized ARDS survivors, this project will evaluate the association between individual-level response shift and patient characteristics, identify the changes in specific aspects of physical, cognitive, and mental health that best predict changes in quality of life between 6 and 12 months after ICU discharge, and evaluate the association between psychosocial factors including patient expectations for functional recovery and quality of life during recovery from ARDS.",Understanding Response Shift in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) survivors,9505590,K01HL141637,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Anxiety ', ' Climacteric ', ' life change ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Critical Care ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Exhibits ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Intensive Care Units ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Learning ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Modernization ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Professional Organizations ', ' professional society ', ' professional membership ', ' professional association ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Publishing ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome ', ' wet lung ', ' Stiff lung ', ' Shock Lung ', ' Da Nang Lung ', ' Adult RDS ', ' Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ', ' ARDS ', ' Self Care ', ' personal care ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Societies ', ' survivorship ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Hospital Mortality ', ' Inhospital Mortality ', ' In-house Mortalities ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' mechanical respiratory assist ', ' Mechanical ventilation ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Phase ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Survivors ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' satisfaction ', ' Funding ', ' Acute respiratory failure ', ' Lung damage ', ' lung injury ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Research Priority ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' Perceived quality of life ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Outcome Study ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Recovery of Function ', ' functional recovery ', ' trait ', ' skills ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' Impaired health ', ' Reporting ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Chest ', ' Thorax ', ' Thoracic ', ' Thorace ', ' response ', ' functional disability ', ' Functional impairment ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Data Element ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Population Sciences ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' Cognitive ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Preparation ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' work group ', ' working group ', ' NHLBI ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' cost ', ' health related quality of life ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' analytical tool ', ' patient expectation ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' Psychosocial Issues ', ' Psychosocial Influences ', ' health data ', ' Data Scientist ', ' Data Science ', ' BD2K ', ' Big Data to Knowledge ', ' patient subtypes ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subsets ', ' Prospective cohort study ', ' Epidemiology trend ', ' Epidemiologic trend ', ' Epidemiological trend ', ' intervention cost ', ' ']",NHLBI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K01,2018,163291,MD-07,0.4714740431485713
"A novel data science and network analysis approach to quantifying facilitators and barriers of low tidal volume ventilation in an international consortium of medical centers PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  This application, “A novel data science and network analysis approach to quantifying facilitators and barriers of low tidal volume ventilation in an international consortium of medical centers,” is in response to PAR-16-238, Dissemination and Implementation Research in Health (R01). Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has high prevalence (10% of intensive care unit admissions) and mortality up to 46%. Low tidal volume ventilation (LTVV) is the most effective therapy for ARDS, lowering mortality by 20-25%, and is part of standard practice. However, use of LTVV is as low as 19% of ARDS patients. There is a poor understanding of the barriers to LTVV adoption: current approaches are deficient because they incorporate biases, lack consistency and comprehensiveness, ignore the influence of interpersonal network- or team- based factors, and do not address setting-specific variation. Our research team has previously identified some patient- and clinician-specific facilitators of and barriers to LTVV adoption. We have used two state-of-the-art data driven methods—data science and network analysis—to preliminarily quantify the impact of a diverse array of potential factors affecting LTVV adoption, including network- and team-based factors. The proposed research is guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and Rogers' Diffusion of Innovations theory. The overall goals of the proposed research are to understand the differences in facilitators and barriers to LTVV adoption between academic and community settings through a definitive, systematic study in a large, diverse consortium of medical centers, and to advance implementation science by providing a model for how data science and network analysis can be applied to understand the adoption of a complex intervention. The overarching hypothesis is that there are different patient-, clinician-, network-, and team-based facilitators and barriers to LTVV adoption in academic and community settings. We will determine whether different patient- and clinician- (Aim 1 cohort study, clinician survey, and data science analysis), clinician interpersonal network- (Aim 2 network analysis), and team structure and dynamics-based (Aim 3 team construction and modeling) facilitators of and barriers to LTVV adoption exist between academic and community hospital settings. Successful completion of the proposed research will provide a comprehensive understanding of the differences in the facilitators of and barriers to LTVV adoption between academic and community settings, and will advance implementation science by serving as a model of how data science and network analysis can be applied to complex implementation problems. Implementation strategies that account for all these factors may be more likely to lead to significant practice change. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has high prevalence and mortality among critically ill patients; low tidal volume ventilation is the most effective therapy for ARDS but is used infrequently. Successful completion of the proposed research will identify differences in the facilitators of and barriers to adoption of low tidal volume ventilation between academic and community hospital settings in a large and diverse consortium of medical centers. The proposed research will generate a model of how data science and network analysis can be used to understand the implementation of a complex evidence-based practice.",A novel data science and network analysis approach to quantifying facilitators and barriers of low tidal volume ventilation in an international consortium of medical centers,9594103,R01HL140362,"['Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Attitude ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Critical Illness ', ' Critically Ill ', ' Diffusion of Innovation ', ' Environment ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Community Hospitals ', ' Intensive Care Units ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Professional Organizations ', ' professional society ', ' professional membership ', ' professional association ', ' Pulmonary Edema ', ' lung edema ', ' Research ', ' Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome ', ' wet lung ', ' Stiff lung ', ' Shock Lung ', ' Da Nang Lung ', ' Adult RDS ', ' Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ', ' ARDS ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Tidal Volume ', ' respiratory airway volume ', ' Environmental air flow ', ' Ventilation ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Acute ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Lung damage ', ' lung injury ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' Height ', ' respiratory ', ' Medical center ', ' Performance ', ' computer science ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Hypoxemia ', ' hypoxemic ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' research data dissemination ', ' research dissemination ', ' Evidence based practice ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' International ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Characteristics ', ' NHLBI ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' implementation research ', ' dissemination research ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' implementation science ', ' community setting ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' Data Scientist ', ' Data Science ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' healthcare settings ', ' health care settings ', ' implementation strategy ', ' ']",NHLBI,NORTHSHORE UNIVERSITY HEALTHSYSTEM,R01,2018,793267,IL-09,0.263167721519424
"Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome after Isolated Traumatic Brain Injury: Platelet Biology, Endothelial Activation, and Mechanical Ventilation PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT This is an application for a K23 award for Dr. Carolyn Hendrickson, a pulmonary and critical care physician at the University of California, San Francisco. Dr. Hendrickson is establishing herself as a young investigator in patient-oriented research of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with a focus on the biologic mechanisms of ARDS after traumatic brain injury (TBI). This K23 award will provide Dr. Hendrickson with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become an expert clinical and translational researcher in ARDS after traumatic injury; (2) to study the biologic mechanisms of ARDS after TBI involving platelet biology, endothelial activation, and lung injury induced by mechanical ventilation; (3) to implement advanced analyses of complex observational data, including machine learning; (4) to develop an independent translational research career. Dr. Hendrickson's plan to achieve these goals is supported by a multidisciplinary mentoring team of experts. Her primary mentor, Dr. Michael Matthay, has extensive experience in translational ARDS research and in the career development of early stage investigators. Dr. Hendrickson will work with four co-mentors: Dr. Mitchell Cohen, a translational researcher studying coagulation after trauma, Dr. Alan Hubbard, a biostatistician specializing in causal inference, Dr. Geoffrey Manley, a neurosurgeon and leading investigator in TBI research, and Dr. Mark Looney, an expert platelet biology and lung injury. The development of ARDS after TBI is common and is associated with worse neurological outcomes. The biologic mechanisms driving ARDS after TBI are poorly understood. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the risk of ARDS after TBI is mediated through activated vascular endothelium and platelets as well as non-protective mechanical ventilation strategies that use large tidal volumes. Dr. Hendrickson will investigate these causal pathways utilizing previously collected data and plasma from an ongoing observational cohort study. In this same cohort she will prospectively collect biospecimens, detailed mechanical ventilation data, and lung ultrasound images. This proposal represents an innovative approach to studying ARDS after TBI using carefully adjudicated exposures and outcomes. Dr. Hendrickson will test whether plasma biomarkers of endothelial activation, vascular permeability, and inflammation (Aim 1) and platelet function, activation, and aggregation (Aim 2) are associated with ARDS after TBI. She will collect lung ultrasound images and frequent mechanical ventilation data including tidal volumes and plateau pressures. She will test whether early exposure to non-protective mechanical ventilation is associated with ARDS after TBI (Aim 3). Addressing this gap in knowledge may lead to interventions that prevent ARDS and improve outcomes in this patient population. The research and training outlined in this proposal will form the basis for an R01-level proposal designed to study interventions to prevent and treat ARDS after traumatic injury. Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because each year in the United States 1.7 million people sustain a Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and over 20% of patients with severe isolated TBI develop Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), a form of serious lung disease associated with poor neurological outcomes after TBI. Identification of biologic factors and mechanical ventilation parameters that contribute to ARDS pathogenesis after TBI is the first step in a continuum of research that will pave the way to prevention, personalized risk assessment, improved early management, and targeted treatments for ARDS in patients with TBI. Additionally, understanding the mechanisms of disease in this vulnerable population will expand the understanding of lung injury pathogenesis after a variety of traumatic injuries and perhaps in other high-risk populations.","Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome after Isolated Traumatic Brain Injury: Platelet Biology, Endothelial Activation, and Mechanical Ventilation",9536120,K23HL133495,"['Adult

"The Role of the Microbiome in the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K23 proposal will complete Robert Dickson, MD's training towards his long-term career goal of improving our understanding and treatment of lung disease by investigation of the microbiome. Dr. Dickson is a Pulmonary and Critical Care physician and scientist at the University of Michigan with established success in the burgeoning field of lung microbiome studies. This proposal builds on Dr. Dickson's previously acquired expertise in pulmonary pathophysiology and microbial ecology with new training in clinical research methods and computational biology. These established and newly-acquired skills will be integrated to improve our understanding of the role of the microbiome in the pathogenesis of the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). This research will be conducted under the guidance of primary mentor Gary B. Huffnagle PhD, co- mentor Theodore J. Standiford MD and an advisory board of accomplished investigators with expertise in clinical research methods, computational biology and lung immunology as well as extensive mentoring success. This 5-year plan includes formal coursework, professional development, and progressively independent research, with defined milestones to ensure productivity and a successful transition to independence. The Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a major cause of morbidity, mortality and expense, responsible for an estimated 74,500 U.S. deaths per year. Numerous studies have identified indirect evidence of translocation of bacteria from the gastrointestinal tract to the lung in patients at risk for ARDS, but to date no study has evaluated the role of microbiome in the pathogenesis of ARDS. This proposal will test the hypothesis that translocation of gut bacteria to the lung provokes the inflammation and injury of ARDS via two specific Scientific Aims. Aim 1 will determine if translocation of enteric bacteria to the lung microbiome precedes the clinical development of ARDS, and Aim 2 will determine the temporal relationship between respiratory dysbiosis, host inflammation and the clinical onset of ARDS. Inherent to completing these high-level aims, Dr. Dickson will execute a prospective cohort study of patients at high risk for ARDS, utilize modern culture-independent techniques of bacterial identification to describe the bacterial communities in the lungs and gastrointestinal tracts of high-risk patients, and apply novel techniques of advanced computational modeling to the complex nonlinear system of ARDS pathogenesis. This work will build to at least two R01 proposals: 1) to determine if the lung microbiome contributes to disease progression among patients with established ARDS and 2) to determine if the lung microbiome can be therapeutically manipulated in critically ill patients to prevent or modulate respiratory disease. n addition to building a foundation for a programmatic line of research to understand the role of the microbiome in lung disease, this proposal will provide Dr. Dickson with research skills applicable to additional domains of human microbiome and ARDS research. This K23 award will equip Dr. Dickson to establish himself as an independent investigator and international leader in this promising field. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a major cause of morbidity, mortality and expense, responsible for an estimated 74,500 U.S. deaths per year; the National Institutes of Health have identified the prevention and early treatment of ARDS as a research priority. We lack an understanding of the pathogenesis of ARDS, impeding our ability to predict and prevent its onset. Determination of the role of the microbiome in the pathogenesis of ARDS would both 1) improve our ability to predict the onset of ARDS, enabling targeted preventive interventions and 2) identify novel therapeutic targets at the microbiome/host interface in patients at risk for ARDS.",The Role of the Microbiome in the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome,9619605,K23HL130641,"['Bacteria ', ' Sympathins ', ' Catecholamines ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Critical Care ', ' Critically Ill ', ' Critical Illness ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Environmental Science ', ' Ecology ', ' Aerobacter ', ' Enterobacter ', ' Enterobacteria ', ' Enteric Bacteria ', ' Coliform Bacilli ', ' Enterobacteriaceae ', ' Therapeutic Epinephrine ', ' Adrenaline ', ' Epinephrine ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' digestive canal ', ' alimentary tract ', ' Gastrointestinal Tract ', ' GI Tract ', ' Digestive Tract ', ' Alimentary Canal ', ' Gastrointestinal tract structure ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Immigration ', ' indexing ', ' Inflammation ', ' Preinterleukin 1 Beta ', ' Interleukin-1β ', ' Interleukin 1beta ', ' IL1β ', ' IL1F2 ', ' IL1B Protein ', ' IL1-β ', ' IL1-Beta ', ' IL-1β ', ' IL-1-b ', ' IL-1 β ', ' IL-1 beta ', ' Beta Proprotein Interleukin 1 ', ' Interleukin-1 beta ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Lung ', ' lung disorder ', ' disorder of the lung ', ' disease of the lung ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Lung diseases ', ' Mentors ', ' Michigan ', ' Modernization ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"The CRIT-ICU Biomarker Panel for Stratification of Mortality Risk in ARDS Patients PROJECT SUMMARY: Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a devastatingly intense lung inflammatory disorder that annually afflicts more than 1 million individuals world-wide (200,000 cases/year in the U.S.) with an unacceptable mortality rate of 30-40%. Substantial clinical and biological heterogeneity within ARDS phenotypes has greatly impeded therapeutic developments to reduce mortality. All therapies currently employed in ARDS management are ge- neric. The critical care community suffers from a lack of tools that allow identification of ARDS sub-phenotypes and individuals most likely to benefit from novel therapies. Recently, the hyperinflammatory and low inflammatory ARDS sub-phenotypes were identified that markedly differ in natural histories, clinical and biological character- istics, biomarker profiles, responses to positive end-expiratory pressure, ventilator- and organ failure-free days and mortality. ARDS severity (PaO2/FiO2 ratio), the severity of renal or hepatic failure, or the extent of leukocy- tosis failed to distinguish the two phenotypes. As the mortality of the hyperinflammatory phenotype is 3-5 times greater than low inflammatory phenotype, this Phase I STTR will leverage substantial complementary expertise to: i) establish a novel panel of ARDS biomarkers (CRIT-ICU Panel) that stratifies subjects at risk for ARDS into high and low mortality sub-phenotypes; and ii) develop a quantitative platform to allow assessment of these validated biomarkers upon patient entry into the ER or ICU. Our preliminary biomarker data are strong and include 11 ARDS-relevant plasma biomarkers in >250 well-phenotyped ARDS subjects and 70 controls. The targeted biomarkers include cytokine-chemokines (IL-6, IL-8, IL-1b, IL-RA), dual-functioning cytozymes i.e. cy- tokine/intracellular enzymes (macrophage migration inhibitory factor, NAMPT), vascular injury markers (VEGF- A, S1PR3, angiopoietin 2), and the advanced glycosylation end product pathway (HMGB1, soluble RAGE). Spe- cific Aim #1 will apply standard biostatistical approaches as well as novel neural network artificial intelligence analysis of this existing dataset to identify an optimal plasma-derived CRIT-ICU Panel which predicts ICU mor- tality in patients with sepsis or trauma who are at risk for development of respiratory failure and ARDS. Specific Aim #2 will develop an optimized and highly standardized Predictive Platform for the CRIT-ICU biomarkers iden- tified to be used in the clinical care setting. Finally, Specific Aim #3 will conduct retrospective validation studies of the optimized CRIT-ICU Panel in biobanked samples from 2 large cohorts: an emergency room-ARDS cohort (PETAL Clinical Network, n=800) and a Spanish sepsis-ARDS cohort (n=200). We speculate that unique exper- tise within Aqualung Therapeutics Corp., PAI Life Sciences Inc., InBios International Inc. and the University of Arizona Health Sciences will drive future prospective validation of the CRIT-ICU Panel in patients at risk for ARDS (Phase II STTR) and lead to development of a true Point of Care test to accelerate clinical trial stratification strategies, and development of innovative ARDS therapeutics to reduce mortality in this devastating syndrome. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a devastatingly intense lung inflammatory disorder that afflicts more than 1 million individuals world-wide each year (200,000 cases/year in the U.S.) with an unacceptable mortality rate of 30-40%.

"Understanding Response Shift in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) survivors Project Summary / Abstract Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a severe lung injury usually requiring mechanical ventilation in an intensive care unit (ICU). While the number of ICU patients requiring mechanical ventilation is steadily increasing, in-hospital mortality is declining, creating a growing population of ARDS survivors. Such survivorship comes at a high “cost,” with ARDS patients frequently experiencing new or worsening physical, cognitive, and/or mental health impairments that last for years after ARDS. NHLBI and professional societies identify improving quality of life for ARDS survivors as a key research priority. Some ARDS survivors may adapt to new impairments over time and report improving quality of life not explained by improvements in objective measures of their physical, cognitive, and mental health. This adaptation phenomenon is known as “response shift.” We hypothesize that ARDS survivors demonstrate widely varying degrees of response shift, and that patients' baseline characteristics prior to ARDS have important associations with the magnitude of response shift after ICU discharge. We also investigate how psychosocial factors, including trait anxiety, social support, resilience, and survivor expectations for functional recovery, impact quality of life during recovery as a first step toward designing and evaluating new interventions for ARDS survivors.  This proposal will exploit a unique, pre-existing cohort of very well-characterized ARDS survivors from the NHLBI ARDS Network Long Term Outcome Study (ALTOS) containing hundreds of data elements per patient. Using modern data science methods, I will empirically evaluate the association between baseline patient characteristics and response shift between 6 and 12 months after ARDS [Aim 1], and identify the changes in specific aspects of physical, cognitive, and mental health, from among ~165 candidate measures, that best predict changes in quality of life [Aim 2]. To investigate how psychosocial factors impact quality of life, I will conduct a new, prospective, ICU cohort study of ARDS survivors to collect data for these novel analyses [Aim 3]. The results from these three Aims will generate new knowledge regarding empirically-derived, testable hypotheses about important determinants of quality of life, and provide essential data for designing future studies of interventions aimed at improving the quality of life of ARDS survivors.  This career development award provides training in data science, patient outcomes-oriented clinical research, and machine learning statistical techniques for the applicant who is a PhD-trained epidemiologist without these skills. Immediate, short-term, and long-term career goals include: (1) publishing results of the proposed research, (2) successfully competing for R-level funding to explore whether addressing psychosocial issues, including setting appropriate patient expectations for recovery, is a potentially modifiable, low-cost intervention to improve ARDS survivor's quality of life, and (3) becoming an NHLBI-funded independent research scientist who conducts innovative and methodologically rigorous data science research on ARDS outcomes. Project Narrative A large and growing number of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) survivors frequently experience new and long-lasting physical, cognitive, and mental health impairments. ARDS survivors may exhibit a phenomenon known as “response shift” in which survivors adapt to new impairments and report improving quality of life not explained by improvements in objective measures of their physical, cognitive, and mental health. Using a cohort of very well-characterized ARDS survivors, this project will evaluate the association between individual-level response shift and patient characteristics, identify the changes in specific aspects of physical, cognitive, and mental health that best predict changes in quality of life between 6 and 12 months after ICU discharge, and evaluate the association between psychosocial factors including patient expectations for functional recovery and quality of life during recovery from ARDS.",Understanding Response Shift in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) survivors,9685220,K01HL141637,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Anxiety ', ' life change ', ' Climacteric ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Critical Care ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Exhibits ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Intensive Care Units ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Learning ', ' longterm study ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Modernization ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' professional society ', ' professional membership ', ' professional association ', ' Professional Organizations ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' Publishing ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' wet lung ', ' Stiff lung ', ' Shock Lung ', ' Da Nang Lung ', ' Adult RDS ', ' Adult ARDS ', ' Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ', ' Acute Respiratory Distress ', ' ARDS ', ' Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome ', ' personal care ', ' Self Care ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Societies ', ' survivorship ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Inhospital Mortality ', ' In-house Mortalities ', ' Hospital Mortality ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Mechanical ventilation ', ' mechanical respiratory assist ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Phase ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Survivors ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' satisfaction ', ' Funding ', ' Acute respiratory failure ', ' lung injury ', ' Lung damage ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Research Priority ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' Perceived quality of life ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Outcome Study ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Recovery of Function ', ' functional recovery ', ' trait ', ' skills ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' Impaired health ', ' Reporting ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Chest ', ' Thorax ', ' Thoracic ', ' Thorace ', ' response ', ' functional disability ', ' Functional impairment ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Data Element ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Population Sciences ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' Cognitive ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Preparation ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' working group ', ' work group ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' NHLBI ', ' cost ', ' health related quality of life ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Impairment ', ' analytical tool ', ' patient expectation ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' Psychosocial Influences ', ' Psychosocial Issues ', ' health data ', ' Data Science ', ' Big Data to Knowledge ', ' BD2K ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subtypes ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subgroups ', ' Prospective cohort study ', ' Epidemiological trend ', ' Epidemiology trend ', ' Epidemiologic trend ', ' intervention cost ', ' ']",NHLBI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K01,2019,166704,MD-07,0.4714740431485713
"TREAT ECARDS: Translating Evidence into Action: Electronic Clinical Decision Support in ARDS PROJECT SUMMARY With an associated mortality of 35%, Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) contributes to the morbidity and mortality seen in many acute conditions such as pneumonia, influenza, sepsis, trauma and aspiration. Yet studies consistently show that ARDS is under-recognized in up to 40% of patients with generally low and variable adoption of practices shown to improve mortality in ARDS. The overall goal of this proposed project is to improve care delivered to ARDS patients by promoting accurate identification of patients with ARDS and increasing adoption of evidence-based interventions shown to improve outcomes in ARDS. With the recent publication of a multi-professional Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) on mechanical ventilation in ARDS, this proposal specifically aims: 1) To increase identification of ARDS patients with an automated electronic tool (ARDS Sniffer 2.0) powered by the predictive analytics of machine learning algorithms and natural language processing. 2) To translate the recently published multi-professional Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) on mechanical ventilation in ARDS into an evidence-based, context-appropriate, Electronic Clinical decision support system in ARDS (ECARDS) for the management of ARDS. This process will be informed by an expert panel from the CPG committee as well as a semi-qualitative analysis of the cognitive decision making process, data needs and workflow of users in a series of Think-Aloud studies and focus group interviews. ARDS Sniffer 2.0, ECARDS and an ARDS Dashboard to show near real-time data on the incidence of ARDS and rate of utilization of best care will then be incorporated within the hospital EMR for useability testing with another series of Think-Aloud and semi-qualitative studies. 3) To evaluate the effectiveness of ARDS Sniffer 2.0, ARDS Dashboard, and ECARDS in a stepped-wedge, cluster randomized control trial of 3 hospitals within the Montefiore Healthcare System to increase utilization of recommended interventions in ARDS and improve outcomes. 4) To promote the dissemination of the clinical decision support system through our partner professional organizations of American Thoracic Society, Society of Critical Care Medicine, and American Association of Respiratory Care and Program for Emergency Preparedness. Because of the high pressure, high acuity, and rapidly changing status of the acutely ill ARDS patient, clinical decision making often defaults to the automated, pattern-driven cognitive processes which are particularly prone to unconscious biases and errors and cognitive overload from large volumes of shifting data. As such, this proposal is the ideal research demonstration project to develop a new clinical decision support tool that will harness the power of big data and predictive analytics to identify ARDS in the hospital and deliver an evidenced-based, expert and user informed clinical decision support tool to clinicians at the right point during their clinical interaction and workflow with these patients in order to promote the right interventions to the right patients at the right time. PROJECT NARRATIVE Even as Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome constitutes the most severe form of respiratory failure in the hospital with an associated mortality of 35%, it is consistently under-recognized and proven treatments are underutilized. This proposal aims to harness the power of big data in the hospital information system to identify patients with ARDS and prompt clinicians with the evidence-based best management of this condition. By developing a computerized decision support system whose design is informed by the experts and the clinicians themselves, this proposal aims to bring the right care to the right patient at the right time to save lives and promote recovery from this devastating condition.",TREAT ECARDS: Translating Evidence into Action: Electronic Clinical Decision Support in ARDS,9763432,R18HS026188,[''],AHRQ,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R18,2019,397898,NY-14,0.5332536000094062
"A Real-Time Computational System for Detecting ARDS Using Ventilator Waveform Data Project Summary:  Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a severe form of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure affecting 10% of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) in the United States. In-hospital mortality of 35-46% has been reported across the spectrum of mild-severe ARDS, and one third of patients with initially mild ARDS will progress to moderate or severe ARDS. Over the last 20 years, multiple studies have reported improved outcomes for ARDS patients using specific ARDS targeted therapies. However, ARDS remains persistently under-recognized and challenging to diagnose. Only one third of ICU providers correctly identify ARDS on the first day when diagnostic criteria are met, and less than two thirds ever recognize the diagnosis in the ICU. This under recognition of ARDS may prevent some patients from receiving lifesaving therapies necessary for treating the disease. Attempts to automate ARDS diagnosis using rule- based algorithms have seen limited success, and require analysis of subjective data from patient histories, like chest scans, which limit diagnosis automation, timeliness, and study reproducibility.  To improve the current state of the art of ARDS detection technology, we intend to utilize objective and readily available data including both ventilator waveform data, (VWD) and electronic health record (EMR) data to 1) improve the recognition of ARDS, and 2) identify high-risk ARDS patients most likely to benefit from additional ARDS treatments. For this task, we will make use of an existing dataset of VWD from over 500 patients receiving mechanical ventilation, including 156 patients with confirmed ARDS. Our preliminary analyses using a machine learned model and a subset of lung physiology features derived solely from VWD, suggest that ARDS can be diagnosed in the absence of a chest scan or medical history. In Aim 1 of this proposal, we will improve our existing model used for discriminating ARDS by adding objective EMR data, and additional features extracted from VWD, such as patient respiratory compliance and airway resistance. Our next focus will be to predict worsening of ARDS severity in intubated patients based on Berlin criteria. So in Aim 2, we will evaluate the best tools for predicting increases in ARDS severity, and which types of temporal information yield the best predictive results.  We hypothesize that model development using additional objective data derived from VWD analysis and the EMR, along with advanced analytic techniques, will further improve ARDS diagnosis, and enable the prediction of clinical trajectories in patients with ARDS. The proposed work will yield innovative clinical decision support models that can be used to improve the state of the art in automated ARDS diagnosis. Our predictive modeling will also enable greater insight into the times when physicians can perform clinical interventions to arrest ARDS induced physiologic deterioration. Ultimately, these innovations could save lives by quickly detecting ARDS, and alerting physicians to begin or intensify ARDS focused therapies based on patient pathophysiologic state. Project Narrative: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a highly lethal disease contracted by over 100,000 Americans each year. We seek to address whether we can create automated technologies to detect onset and change in severity of ARDS in critically ill patients using widely available ventilator waveform data. With these automated diagnostic testing technologies, doctors can promptly deliver necessary treatments for ARDS before the disease worsens.",A Real-Time Computational System for Detecting ARDS Using Ventilator Waveform Data,9882887,F31HL144028,"['Affect ', ' Airway Resistance ', ' Algorithms ', ' Automation ', ' Berlin ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Critically Ill ', ' Critical Illness ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Intensive Care Units ', ' Learning ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Lung ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Physiology ', ' Research ', ' wet lung ', ' Stiff lung ', ' Shock Lung ', ' Da Nang Lung ', ' Adult RDS ', ' Adult ARDS ', ' Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ', ' Acute Respiratory Distress ', ' ARDS ', ' Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome ', ' Savings ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Inhospital Mortality ', ' In-house Mortalities ', ' Hospital Mortality ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' Decision Support Model ', ' Ventilator ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Mechanical ventilation ', ' mechanical respiratory assist ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Phase ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Series ', ' prognostic ', ' insight ', ' Discipline ', ' Medical History ', ' Personal Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Personal Medical History ', ' Acute respiratory failure ', ' Contracts ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Life ', ' Hour ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Scanning ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' respiratory ', ' American ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' computer science ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Hypoxemia ', ' hypoxemic ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Chest ', ' Thorax ', ' Thoracic ', ' Thorace ', ' Deterioration ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' model development ', ' Provider ', ' Respiratory Failure ', ' respiratory insufficiency/failure ', ' pulmonary failure ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' markov model ', ' adjudicate ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' computer algorithm ', ' high risk ', ' clinical predictors ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted therapy ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' improved outcome ', ' predictive tools ', ' clinical translation ', ' high dimensionality ', ' clinical decision support ', ' recurrent neural network ', ' deep learning ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,F31,2019,37193,CA-03,0.5692053992432872
"Data-Driven Identification of the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This K01 proposal will complete Michael Sjoding, MD, MSc's training towards his long-term career goal of improving care of patients with acute respiratory disease. Dr. Sjoding is a Pulmonary and Critical Physician at the University of Michigan with master's level training in clinical study design and biostatistics. This proposal builds on Dr. Sjoding's prior expertise, providing protected time for additional training in data science, the technical methods for deriving new knowledge about human disease from “Big Biomedical Data” in the rich training environment at the University of Michigan. The project's research goal is to develop real-time systems to improve accuracy and timeliness of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) diagnosis using electronic health record data. ARDS is a critical illness syndrome affecting 200,000 people each year with high mortality. Under-recognition of this syndrome is the key barrier to providing evidence-based care to patients with ARDS. The research will be completed under the guidance of primary mentor Theodore J. Iwashyna, MD, PhD and co-mentors Timothy P. Hofer, MD, MSc, and Kayvan Najarian, PhD, and a scientific advisory board with additional expertise in data science and applied clinical informatics. The 5-year plan includes didactic coursework, mentored research, and professional development activities, with defined milestones to ensure successful transition to independence. The mentored research has 2 specific Aims: Aim 1. Develop a novel system for identifying ARDS digital signatures in electronic health data to accurately identify patients meeting ARDS criteria. Aim 2. Define the early natural history of developing ARDS, to more accurately predict patients' future ARDS risk. Both Aims will utilize rigorous 2-part designs, with the ARDS diagnostic and prediction models developed in the same retrospective cohort and validated in temporally distinct cohorts. In completing these high-level aims, the research will leverage high-resolution electronic health record and beside-monitoring device data to study ARDS with unprecedented detail, providing new insights into ARDS epidemiology and early natural history. This work will build to at least two R01 proposals: (1) testing the impact of a real-time electronic health record- based ARDS diagnostic system to improve evidence-based care practice, (2) defining ARDS subtypes using deep clinical phenotypic data. The work will build toward a programmatic line of research using high-resolution electronic health data to improve understanding of critical illness and respiratory disease. In completing this proposal, Dr. Sjoding will acquire unique computational expertise in data science methods, complementing his previous training, which he can then readily apply to address other research challenges in respiratory health. The ambitious but feasible training and mentored research proposed during this K01 award will allow him to achieve his goal of becoming an independent investigator.

"A novel data science and network analysis approach to quantifying facilitators and barriers of low tidal volume ventilation in an international consortium of medical centers PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  This application, “A novel data science and network analysis approach to quantifying facilitators and barriers of low tidal volume ventilation in an international consortium of medical centers,” is in response to PAR-16-238, Dissemination and Implementation Research in Health (R01). Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has high prevalence (10% of intensive care unit admissions) and mortality up to 46%. Low tidal volume ventilation (LTVV) is the most effective therapy for ARDS, lowering mortality by 20-25%, and is part of standard practice. However, use of LTVV is as low as 19% of ARDS patients. There is a poor understanding of the barriers to LTVV adoption: current approaches are deficient because they incorporate biases, lack consistency and comprehensiveness, ignore the influence of interpersonal network- or team- based factors, and do not address setting-specific variation. Our research team has previously identified some patient- and clinician-specific facilitators of and barriers to LTVV adoption. We have used two state-of-the-art data driven methods—data science and network analysis—to preliminarily quantify the impact of a diverse array of potential factors affecting LTVV adoption, including network- and team-based factors. The proposed research is guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and Rogers' Diffusion of Innovations theory. The overall goals of the proposed research are to understand the differences in facilitators and barriers to LTVV adoption between academic and community settings through a definitive, systematic study in a large, diverse consortium of medical centers, and to advance implementation science by providing a model for how data science and network analysis can be applied to understand the adoption of a complex intervention. The overarching hypothesis is that there are different patient-, clinician-, network-, and team-based facilitators and barriers to LTVV adoption in academic and community settings. We will determine whether different patient- and clinician- (Aim 1 cohort study, clinician survey, and data science analysis), clinician interpersonal network- (Aim 2 network analysis), and team structure and dynamics-based (Aim 3 team construction and modeling) facilitators of and barriers to LTVV adoption exist between academic and community hospital settings. Successful completion of the proposed research will provide a comprehensive understanding of the differences in the facilitators of and barriers to LTVV adoption between academic and community settings, and will advance implementation science by serving as a model of how data science and network analysis can be applied to complex implementation problems. Implementation strategies that account for all these factors may be more likely to lead to significant practice change. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has high prevalence and mortality among critically ill patients; low tidal volume ventilation is the most effective therapy for ARDS but is used infrequently. Successful completion of the proposed research will identify differences in the facilitators of and barriers to adoption of low tidal volume ventilation between academic and community hospital settings in a large and diverse consortium of medical centers. The proposed research will generate a model of how data science and network analysis can be used to understand the implementation of a complex evidence-based practice.",A novel data science and network analysis approach to quantifying facilitators and barriers of low tidal volume ventilation in an international consortium of medical centers,9781491,R01HL140362,"['Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Attitude ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Critically Ill ', ' Critical Illness ', ' Diffusion of Innovation ', ' Environment ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Community Hospitals ', ' Intensive Care Units ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' nurse ', ' Nurses ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' professional society ', ' professional membership ', ' professional association ', ' Professional Organizations ', ' lung edema ', ' Pulmonary Edema ', ' Research ', ' wet lung ', ' Stiff lung ', ' Shock Lung ', ' Da Nang Lung ', ' Adult RDS ', ' Adult ARDS ', ' Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ', ' Acute Respiratory Distress ', ' ARDS ', ' Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' respiratory airway volume ', ' Tidal Volume ', ' Ventilation ', ' Environmental air flow ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Acute ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' lung injury ', ' Lung damage ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' Height ', ' respiratory ', ' Medical center ', ' Performance ', ' computer science ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Hypoxemia ', ' hypoxemic ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' research dissemination ', ' research data dissemination ', ' Evidence based practice ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' International ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Characteristics ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' NHLBI ', ' implementation research ', ' dissemination research ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' implementation science ', ' community setting ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' Data Science ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' health care settings ', ' healthcare settings ', ' implementation strategy ', ' ']",NHLBI,NORTHSHORE UNIVERSITY HEALTHSYSTEM,R01,2019,747700,IL-09,0.263167721519424
"The Role of the Microbiome in the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K23 proposal will complete Robert Dickson, MD's training towards his long-term career goal of improving our understanding and treatment of lung disease by investigation of the microbiome. Dr. Dickson is a Pulmonary and Critical Care physician and scientist at the University of Michigan with established success in the burgeoning field of lung microbiome studies. This proposal builds on Dr. Dickson's previously acquired expertise in pulmonary pathophysiology and microbial ecology with new training in clinical research methods and computational biology. These established and newly-acquired skills will be integrated to improve our understanding of the role of the microbiome in the pathogenesis of the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). This research will be conducted under the guidance of primary mentor Gary B. Huffnagle PhD, co- mentor Theodore J. Standiford MD and an advisory board of accomplished investigators with expertise in clinical research methods, computational biology and lung immunology as well as extensive mentoring success. This 5-year plan includes formal coursework, professional development, and progressively independent research, with defined milestones to ensure productivity and a successful transition to independence. The Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a major cause of morbidity, mortality and expense, responsible for an estimated 74,500 U.S. deaths per year. Numerous studies have identified indirect evidence of translocation of bacteria from the gastrointestinal tract to the lung in patients at risk for ARDS, but to date no study has evaluated the role of microbiome in the pathogenesis of ARDS. This proposal will test the hypothesis that translocation of gut bacteria to the lung provokes the inflammation and injury of ARDS via two specific Scientific Aims. Aim 1 will determine if translocation of enteric bacteria to the lung microbiome precedes the clinical development of ARDS, and Aim 2 will determine the temporal relationship between respiratory dysbiosis, host inflammation and the clinical onset of ARDS. Inherent to completing these high-level aims, Dr. Dickson will execute a prospective cohort study of patients at high risk for ARDS, utilize modern culture-independent techniques of bacterial identification to describe the bacterial communities in the lungs and gastrointestinal tracts of high-risk patients, and apply novel techniques of advanced computational modeling to the complex nonlinear system of ARDS pathogenesis. This work will build to at least two R01 proposals: 1) to determine if the lung microbiome contributes to disease progression among patients with established ARDS and 2) to determine if the lung microbiome can be therapeutically manipulated in critically ill patients to prevent or modulate respiratory disease. n addition to building a foundation for a programmatic line of research to understand the role of the microbiome in lung disease, this proposal will provide Dr. Dickson with research skills applicable to additional domains of human microbiome and ARDS research. This K23 award will equip Dr. Dickson to establish himself as an independent investigator and international leader in this promising field. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a major cause of morbidity, mortality and expense, responsible for an estimated 74,500 U.S. deaths per year; the National Institutes of Health have identified the prevention and early treatment of ARDS as a research priority. We lack an understanding of the pathogenesis of ARDS, impeding our ability to predict and prevent its onset.

"Groundwork for a Synchrotron MicroCT Imaging Resource for Biology (SMIRB) Project Summary We request a high-flux x-ray source and to acquire new team expertise in segmentation from microCT images, in order to apply a new 3D form of histology developed through our parent R24 to begin to characterize the cellular and tissue geometries of COVID-19-associated Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) pneumonia, our pandemic’s most common cause of death. Our novel imaging tool, X-ray histotomography, is based on microCT of fixed and metal-stained tissue. It is unique among 3D imaging methods as the only nondestructive way to achieve pan-cellular imaging (allowing characterization of all cell types and tissues) and is potentially practical. Histotomography uniquely allows direct comparison with today’s 2D standard of tissue diagnosis, histology, capable of producing both 3D renderings and undistorted 2D slices at any angle and any slice thickness. Unlike histology, we will also allow us to precisely characterize cellular arrangements into tissues after fixing and staining of samples with metal. The ability to volumetrically characterize cell types and their arrangements in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is particularly important because it is what kills most patients in coronavirus-based pandemics, including SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus) in 2003, MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) in 2012, COVID-19 now. The proposed work will increase our preparedness for future pandemics. ARDS lungs are an ideal human tissue model for mathematically defining human disease because all cell types are affected. The proposed work with COVID-19 lungs will increase the precision with which we understand the different stages of coronavirus lung infection and serve as a model for characterizing the Geometry of Disease across all organ systems. Histotomography in the parent R24 is currently limited to animal models, focusing on the zebrafish. The supplement will allow us to translate our work to human health, which was originally envisioned by the PI, as part of defining the “Geometry of Disease”. Our experience with this technology tells us that we will be able to characterize the numbers of each of the basic inflammatory cell types, including lymphocytes, neutrophils, and macrophages (which are morphologically distinct) in terms of numbers, volumes, shapes, and density in the inflamed tissue, and to also characterize the changes in the lung epithelia (bronchial ciliated epithelial cells and pneumocytes, cell death, and the filling of airways with fluid and fibrinous exudate, and vascular inflammation. In addition to quantitation of tissue changes, we will also be able to visualize pathological change in the tissues using virtual reality. Histotomography will serve as a way to validate a humanized mouse model of COVID-19 infection by comparing the quantitative changes with those in human autopsy samples. We will be comparing both standard histological sections and histotomographic images from adjacent tissue. Machine learning will ultimately allow us to automate recognition of cell types and pathological change. The proposed augmentation of our instrumentation and expertise will facilitate definitions of the “Geometry of Disease” across organ systems. Project narrative We request an equipment upgrade and acquisition of expertise to accelerate progress and to pilot the translational use of our ORIP-funded technology to provide the first 3D understanding of the pathogenesis of COVID-19 pneumonia. Histotomography, a new 3D form of histology based on microCT, is the first practical way to turn the current standard of 2D, qualitative, tissue analytics into quantitative, morphometrics that is inclusive of all cell types and tissue architecture. Organismal and tissue phenotyping at both scales makes possible the first 3D, complete phenotyping of cells and tissue architecture, promising to transform human tissue diagnostics, preclinical

"Great Lakes Node of the Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network PROJECT SUMMARY  Individuals with substance use disorders are disproportionately experiencing homelessness, poverty, and chronic medical conditions (diabetes and hypertension), which are emerging risk factors for contracting SARS-CoV-2 (official name for the virus that causes COVID-19). Different types of substance use have been associated with development of respiratory infections and progression to severe respiratory failure, also known as Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). However, complex syndromes like ARDS and behavioral conditions like substance misuse are difficult to identify from the electronic health record. Clinical notes and radiology reports provide a rich source of information that may be used to identify cases of substance misuse and ARDS. This information is routinely recorded during hospital care, and automated, data-driven solutions with natural language processing (NLP) can extract semantics and important risk factors from the unstructured data of clinical notes. The computational methods of NLP derive meaning from clinical notes, from which machine learning can predict risk factors for patients leaving AMA or progressing to respiratory failure. Our team developed tools with >80% sensitivity/specificity to identify individual types of substance misuse using NLP with machine learning (ML). Our single-center models delineated risk factors embedded in the notes (e.g., mental health conditions, socioeconomic indicators). Further, we have developed and externally validated a machine learning tool to identify cases of ARDS with high accuracy for early treatment. We aim to expand this work by pooling data across health systems and build a generalizable and comprehensive classifier that captures multiple types of substance misuse for use in risk stratification and prognostication during the COVID pandemic.  We hypothesize that a single-model NLP substance misuse classifier will provide a standardized, interoperable, and accurate approach for universal analysis of hospitalized patients, and that such information can be used to identify those at risk for disrupted care and those at risk for respiratory failure. We aim to train and test our substance misuse classifiers at Rush in a retrospective dataset of over 60,000 hospitalizations that have been manually screened with the universal screen, AUDIT, and DAST. This Administrative Supplement will allow us to examine the correlations between substances of misuse and risk for COVID-19 as well as development of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) in the context of these phenomena. PROJECT NARRATIVE We anticipate that the research proposed will provide novel and critically important tools in artificial intelligence for the detection of substance misuse and COVID-19 from the electronic health record (EHR). Development and validation of a digital classifier would enable a standardized approach to perform screening on all patient encounters on a daily basis in health systems. We will rigorously develop and test the classifier retrospectively on an existing dataset of 60,000 patients. This will serve as the first step towards a comprehensive universal screener that leverages available data in the EHR.",Great Lakes Node of the Drug Abuse Clinical Trials

"Molecular characterization of pulmonary edema: a window to an injured lung Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a heterogeneous, life-threatening condition defined by poor oxygenation and bilateral pulmonary edema that carries a mortality rate >40% in most studies. Every ARDS drug trial to date has failed, perhaps because the clinical criteria defining ARDS include a substantial subset of low-risk patients. Clinical scoring systems poorly predict which ARDS patients will develop prolonged respiratory failure and are at increased risk of death.  Molecular profiling of pulmonary edema fluid could serve as a window on the alveolar microenvironment, enabling identification of high-risk patients. Pulmonary edema directly reflects lung pathobiology including loss of barrier integrity, inflammation, and epithelial damage. Unfortunately, free-flowing pulmonary edema has limited clinical utility because it can only be captured in a minority of patients. Molecular characterization of pulmonary edema is now possible in every patient with ARDS because of two critical innovations. First, we discovered that edema fluid condensing in the HME (heat and moisture exchanger) filter of the ventilator circuit, usually discarded as trash, closely reflects free-flowing edema. Second, we developed a non-targeted metabolomic fingerprinting method using mass spectroscopy that characterizes molecular components in trace quantities of fluid. Together, these innovations make it possible to test the central hypothesis that molecular features of edema fluid reflect pathobiology and enable ARDS risk stratification.  To address the prognostic enrichment potential of HME edema fluid, 300 early ARDS patients will be recruited at 3 US centers, with protocolized HME edema fluid collection. Aim 1 is to study whether high HME edema fluid total protein and lung-injury specific proteins predict prolonged respiratory failure ≥48h in ARDS. Aim 2 is to test whether hypermetabolic edema fluid and inflammatory lipids predict prolonged respiratory failure ≥48h in ARDS. In Aim 3, LASSO machine learning will be used to integrate all proteomic and metabolomic edema features into a prolonged mechanical ventilation classifier. The robustness of the classifier will be assessed by measuring whether it adds prognostic value to clinical ARDS severity scores, identifying how well key molecular features are reflected in plasma, and testing for replication in an independent cohort.  The goal of these studies is to examine to what extent a novel and readily available lung-specific sample, obtained early in the course of ARDS, reflects biology and can predict ARDS outcomes, thus offering prognostic enrichment for future clinical trials. Successful completion of the Specific Aims offers the potential for a much-needed classification scheme to better refine, understand, and therapeutically-target ARDS. PROJECT NARRATIVE Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a common, life-threatening condition with no approved drug treatments. Pulmonary edema is a cardinal feature of ARDS and is mirrored closely by edema fluid collected passively in the Heat Moisture Exchanger (HME) filter; thus HME filter edema provides a novel and completely non-invasive window to the alveolar microenvironment. This proposal seeks to understand whether molecular characteristics of HME filter edema predict prolonged respiratory failure and could facilitate enrollment of high-risk patients into ARDS clinical trials.",Molecular characterization of pulmonary edema: a window to an injured lung,9945838,R01HL152083,"['Biology ', ' Bronchoscopy ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Edema ', ' Dropsy ', ' Hydrops ', ' Electrons ', ' Negative Beta Particle ', ' Negatrons ', ' Epithelium ', ' Epithelium Part ', ' Fingerprint ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Inflammation ', ' Lipids ', ' Lung ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' pulmonary ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Plasma ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Proteins ', ' Pulmonary Edema ', ' lung edema ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome ', ' ARDS ', ' Acute Respiratory Distress ', ' Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ', ' Adult ARDS ', ' Adult RDS ', ' Da Nang Lung ', ' Shock Lung ', ' Stiff lung ', ' wet lung ', ' Risk ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Measures ', ' Intensive Care ', ' Ventilator ', ' AGE receptor ', ' RAGE receptor ', ' advanced glycosylation end product receptor ', ' amphoterin receptor ', ' receptor for AGE ', ' receptor for advanced glycation end product ', ' receptor of AGE ', ' receptor for advanced glycation endproducts ', ' mechanical respiratory assist ', ' Mechanical ventilation ', ' Clinical ', ' prognostic ', ' Epithelial ', ' Lung Alveolar Epithelia ', ' alveolar epithelium ', ' peripheral blood ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Bilateral ', ' Sample Size ', ' Lung damage ', ' lung injury ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Functional disorder ', ' fluid ', ' liquid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' Inflammatory ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Hour ', ' Severities ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' System ', ' ionization ', ' cohort ', ' Informatics ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Proteomics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' pulmonary failure ', ' respiratory insufficiency/failure ', ' Respiratory Failure ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' Alveolar ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' molecular profile ', ' molecular signature ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' Classification Scheme ', ' Collection ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' protein metabolite ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' therapeutic target ', ' high risk ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' treatment strategy ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' prognostic ability ', ' prognostic power ', ' prognostic utility ', ' prognostic value ', ' Risk stratification ', ' recruit ', ' death risk ', ' mortality risk ', ' epithelial injury ', ' ']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,575013,CA-18,0.49161384654395773
"TREAT ECARDS: Translating Evidence into Action: Electronic Clinical Decision Support in ARDS PROJECT SUMMARY With an associated mortality of 35%, Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) contributes to the morbidity and mortality seen in many acute conditions such as pneumonia, influenza, sepsis, trauma and aspiration. Yet studies consistently show that ARDS is under-recognized in up to 40% of patients with generally low and variable adoption of practices shown to improve mortality in ARDS. The overall goal of this proposed project is to improve care delivered to ARDS patients by promoting accurate identification of patients with ARDS and increasing adoption of evidence-based interventions shown to improve outcomes in ARDS. With the recent publication of a multi-professional Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) on mechanical ventilation in ARDS, this proposal specifically aims: 1) To increase identification of ARDS patients with an automated electronic tool (ARDS Sniffer 2.0) powered by the predictive analytics of machine learning algorithms and natural language processing. 2) To translate the recently published multi-professional Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) on mechanical ventilation in ARDS into an evidence-based, context-appropriate, Electronic Clinical decision support system in ARDS (ECARDS) for the management of ARDS. This process will be informed by an expert panel from the CPG committee as well as a semi-qualitative analysis of the cognitive decision making process, data needs and workflow of users in a series of Think-Aloud studies and focus group interviews. ARDS Sniffer 2.0, ECARDS and an ARDS Dashboard to show near real-time data on the incidence of ARDS and rate of utilization of best care will then be incorporated within the hospital EMR for useability testing with another series of Think-Aloud and semi-qualitative studies. 3) To evaluate the effectiveness of ARDS Sniffer 2.0, ARDS Dashboard, and ECARDS in a stepped-wedge, cluster randomized control trial of 3 hospitals within the Montefiore Healthcare System to increase utilization of recommended interventions in ARDS and improve outcomes. 4) To promote the dissemination of the clinical decision support system through our partner professional organizations of American Thoracic Society, Society of Critical Care Medicine, and American Association of Respiratory Care and Program for Emergency Preparedness. Because of the high pressure, high acuity, and rapidly changing status of the acutely ill ARDS patient, clinical decision making often defaults to the automated, pattern-driven cognitive processes which are particularly prone to unconscious biases and errors and cognitive overload from large volumes of shifting data. As such, this proposal is the ideal research demonstration project to develop a new clinical decision support tool that will harness the power of big data and predictive analytics to identify ARDS in the hospital and deliver an evidenced-based, expert and user informed clinical decision support tool to clinicians at the right point during their clinical interaction and workflow with these patients in order to promote the right interventions to the right patients at the right time. PROJECT NARRATIVE Even as Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome constitutes the most severe form of respiratory failure in the hospital with an associated mortality of 35%, it is consistently under-recognized and proven treatments are underutilized. This proposal aims to harness the power of big data in the hospital information system to identify patients with ARDS and prompt clinicians with the evidence-based best management of this condition. By developing a computerized decision support system whose design is informed by the experts and the clinicians themselves, this proposal aims to bring the right care to the right patient at the right time to save lives and promote recovery from this devastating condition.",TREAT ECARDS: Translating Evidence into Action: Electronic Clinical Decision Support in ARDS,9965913,R18HS026188,[''],AHRQ,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R18,2020,397809,NY-14,0.5332536000094062
"A novel data science and network analysis approach to quantifying facilitators and barriers of low tidal volume ventilation in an international consortium of medical centers PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  This application, “A novel data science and network analysis approach to quantifying facilitators and barriers of low tidal volume ventilation in an international consortium of medical centers,” is in response to PAR-16-238, Dissemination and Implementation Research in Health (R01). Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has high prevalence (10% of intensive care unit admissions) and mortality up to 46%. Low tidal volume ventilation (LTVV) is the most effective therapy for ARDS, lowering mortality by 20-25%, and is part of standard practice. However, use of LTVV is as low as 19% of ARDS patients. There is a poor understanding of the barriers to LTVV adoption: current approaches are deficient because they incorporate biases, lack consistency and comprehensiveness, ignore the influence of interpersonal network- or team- based factors, and do not address setting-specific variation. Our research team has previously identified some patient- and clinician-specific facilitators of and barriers to LTVV adoption. We have used two state-of-the-art data driven methods—data science and network analysis—to preliminarily quantify the impact of a diverse array of potential factors affecting LTVV adoption, including network- and team-based factors. The proposed research is guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and Rogers' Diffusion of Innovations theory. The overall goals of the proposed research are to understand the differences in facilitators and barriers to LTVV adoption between academic and community settings through a definitive, systematic study in a large, diverse consortium of medical centers, and to advance implementation science by providing a model for how data science and network analysis can be applied to understand the adoption of a complex intervention. The overarching hypothesis is that there are different patient-, clinician-, network-, and team-based facilitators and barriers to LTVV adoption in academic and community settings. We will determine whether different patient- and clinician- (Aim 1 cohort study, clinician survey, and data science analysis), clinician interpersonal network- (Aim 2 network analysis), and team structure and dynamics-based (Aim 3 team construction and modeling) facilitators of and barriers to LTVV adoption exist between academic and community hospital settings. Successful completion of the proposed research will provide a comprehensive understanding of the differences in the facilitators of and barriers to LTVV adoption between academic and community settings, and will advance implementation science by serving as a model of how data science and network analysis can be applied to complex implementation problems. Implementation strategies that account for all these factors may be more likely to lead to significant practice change. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has high prevalence and mortality among critically ill patients; low tidal volume ventilation is the most effective therapy for ARDS but is used infrequently. Successful completion of the proposed research will identify differences in the facilitators of and barriers to adoption of low tidal volume ventilation between academic and community hospital settings in a large and diverse consortium of medical centers. The proposed research will generate a model of how data science and network analysis can be used to understand the implementation of a complex evidence-based practice.",A novel data science and network analysis approach to quantifying facilitators and barriers of low tidal volume ventilation in an international consortium of medical centers,9963341,R01HL140362,"['Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Attitude ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Critical Illness ', ' Critically Ill ', ' Diffusion of Innovation ', ' Environment ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Community Hospitals ', ' Intensive Care Units ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Professional Organizations ', ' professional association ', ' professional membership ', ' professional society ', ' Pulmonary Edema ', ' lung edema ', ' Research ', ' Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome ', ' ARDS ', ' Acute Respiratory Distress ', ' Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ', ' Adult ARDS ', ' Adult RDS ', ' Da Nang Lung ', ' Shock Lung ', ' Stiff lung ', ' wet lung ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Tidal Volume ', ' respiratory airway volume ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Acute ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Lung damage ', ' lung injury ', ' Inflammatory ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' Height ', ' respiratory ', ' Medical center ', ' Performance ', ' computer science ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' hypoxemic ', ' Hypoxemia ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Evidence based practice ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' International ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Characteristics ', ' NHLBI ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' implementation research ', ' dissemination research ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' implementation science ', ' community setting ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' Data Science ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' healthcare settings ', ' health care settings ', ' implementation strategy ', ' complex data  ', ' ventilation ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NHLBI,NORTHSHORE UNIVERSITY HEALTHSYSTEM,R01,2020,745390,IL-09,0.263167721519424
"Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome after Isolated Traumatic Brain Injury: Platelet Biology, Endothelial Activation, and Mechanical Ventilation PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT This is an application for a K23 award for Dr. Carolyn Hendrickson, a pulmonary and critical care physician at the University of California, San Francisco. Dr. Hendrickson is establishing herself as a young investigator in patient-oriented research of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with a focus on the biologic mechanisms of ARDS after traumatic brain injury (TBI). This K23 award will provide Dr. Hendrickson with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become an expert clinical and translational researcher in ARDS after traumatic injury; (2) to study the biologic mechanisms of ARDS after TBI involving platelet biology, endothelial activation, and lung injury induced by mechanical ventilation; (3) to implement advanced analyses of complex observational data, including machine learning; (4) to develop an independent translational research career. Dr. Hendrickson's plan to achieve these goals is supported by a multidisciplinary mentoring team of experts. Her primary mentor, Dr. Michael Matthay, has extensive experience in translational ARDS research and in the career development of early stage investigators. Dr. Hendrickson will work with four co-mentors: Dr. Mitchell Cohen, a translational researcher studying coagulation after trauma, Dr. Alan Hubbard, a biostatistician specializing in causal inference, Dr. Geoffrey Manley, a neurosurgeon and leading investigator in TBI research, and Dr. Mark Looney, an expert platelet biology and lung injury. The development of ARDS after TBI is common and is associated with worse neurological outcomes. The biologic mechanisms driving ARDS after TBI are poorly understood. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the risk of ARDS after TBI is mediated through activated vascular endothelium and platelets as well as non-protective mechanical ventilation strategies that use large tidal volumes. Dr. Hendrickson will investigate these causal pathways utilizing previously collected data and plasma from an ongoing observational cohort study. In this same cohort she will prospectively collect biospecimens, detailed mechanical ventilation data, and lung ultrasound images. This proposal represents an innovative approach to studying ARDS after TBI using carefully adjudicated exposures and outcomes. Dr. Hendrickson will test whether plasma biomarkers of endothelial activation, vascular permeability, and inflammation (Aim 1) and platelet function, activation, and aggregation (Aim 2) are associated with ARDS after TBI. She will collect lung ultrasound images and frequent mechanical ventilation data including tidal volumes and plateau pressures. She will test whether early exposure to non-protective mechanical ventilation is associated with ARDS after TBI (Aim 3). Addressing this gap in knowledge may lead to interventions that prevent ARDS and improve outcomes in this patient population. The research and training outlined in this proposal will form the basis for an R01-level proposal designed to study interventions to prevent and treat ARDS after traumatic injury. Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because each year in the United States 1.7 million people sustain a Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and over 20% of patients with severe isolated TBI develop Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), a form of serious lung disease associated with poor neurological outcomes after TBI. Identification of biologic factors and mechanical ventilation parameters that contribute to ARDS pathogenesis after TBI is the first step in a continuum of research that will pave the way to prevention, personalized risk assessment, improved early management, and targeted treatments for ARDS in patients with TBI. Additionally, understanding the mechanisms of disease in this vulnerable population will expand the understanding of lung injury pathogenesis after a variety of traumatic injuries and perhaps in other high-risk populations.","Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome after Isolated Traumatic Brain Injury: Platelet Biology, Endothelial Activation, and Mechanical Ventilation",9983146,K23HL133495,"['Adult

"Understanding Response Shift in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) survivors Project Summary / Abstract Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a severe lung injury usually requiring mechanical ventilation in an intensive care unit (ICU). While the number of ICU patients requiring mechanical ventilation is steadily increasing, in-hospital mortality is declining, creating a growing population of ARDS survivors. Such survivorship comes at a high “cost,” with ARDS patients frequently experiencing new or worsening physical, cognitive, and/or mental health impairments that last for years after ARDS. NHLBI and professional societies identify improving quality of life for ARDS survivors as a key research priority. Some ARDS survivors may adapt to new impairments over time and report improving quality of life not explained by improvements in objective measures of their physical, cognitive, and mental health. This adaptation phenomenon is known as “response shift.” We hypothesize that ARDS survivors demonstrate widely varying degrees of response shift, and that patients' baseline characteristics prior to ARDS have important associations with the magnitude of response shift after ICU discharge. We also investigate how psychosocial factors, including trait anxiety, social support, resilience, and survivor expectations for functional recovery, impact quality of life during recovery as a first step toward designing and evaluating new interventions for ARDS survivors.  This proposal will exploit a unique, pre-existing cohort of very well-characterized ARDS survivors from the NHLBI ARDS Network Long Term Outcome Study (ALTOS) containing hundreds of data elements per patient. Using modern data science methods, I will empirically evaluate the association between baseline patient characteristics and response shift between 6 and 12 months after ARDS [Aim 1], and identify the changes in specific aspects of physical, cognitive, and mental health, from among ~165 candidate measures, that best predict changes in quality of life [Aim 2]. To investigate how psychosocial factors impact quality of life, I will conduct a new, prospective, ICU cohort study of ARDS survivors to collect data for these novel analyses [Aim 3]. The results from these three Aims will generate new knowledge regarding empirically-derived, testable hypotheses about important determinants of quality of life, and provide essential data for designing future studies of interventions aimed at improving the quality of life of ARDS survivors.  This career development award provides training in data science, patient outcomes-oriented clinical research, and machine learning statistical techniques for the applicant who is a PhD-trained epidemiologist without these skills. Immediate, short-term, and long-term career goals include: (1) publishing results of the proposed research, (2) successfully competing for R-level funding to explore whether addressing psychosocial issues, including setting appropriate patient expectations for recovery, is a potentially modifiable, low-cost intervention to improve ARDS survivor's quality of life, and (3) becoming an NHLBI-funded independent research scientist who conducts innovative and methodologically rigorous data science research on ARDS outcomes. Project Narrative A large and growing number of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) survivors frequently experience new and long-lasting physical, cognitive, and mental health impairments. ARDS survivors may exhibit a phenomenon known as “response shift” in which survivors adapt to new impairments and report improving quality of life not explained by improvements in objective measures of their physical, cognitive, and mental health. Using a cohort of very well-characterized ARDS survivors, this project will evaluate the association between individual-level response shift and patient characteristics, identify the changes in specific aspects of physical, cognitive, and mental health that best predict changes in quality of life between 6 and 12 months after ICU discharge, and evaluate the association between psychosocial factors including patient expectations for functional recovery and quality of life during recovery from ARDS.",Understanding Response Shift in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) survivors,9925813,K01HL141637,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Anxiety ', ' Climacteric ', ' life change ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Critical Care ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Exhibits ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Intensive Care Units ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Learning ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Modernization ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Professional Organizations ', ' professional association ', ' professional membership ', ' professional society ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Publishing ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome ', ' ARDS ', ' Acute Respiratory Distress ', ' Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ', ' Adult ARDS ', ' Adult RDS ', ' Da Nang Lung ', ' Shock Lung ', ' Stiff lung ', ' wet lung ', ' Self Care ', ' personal care ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Societies ', ' survivorship ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Hospital Mortality ', ' In-house Mortalities ', ' Inhospital Mortality ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Task Forces ', ' advisory team ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' mechanical respiratory assist ', ' Mechanical ventilation ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Phase ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Survivors ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' satisfaction ', ' Funding ', ' Acute respiratory failure ', ' Lung damage ', ' lung injury ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Research Priority ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' Perceived quality of life ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Outcome Study ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' functional recovery ', ' Recovery of Function ', ' trait ', ' skills ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' Impaired health ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Thorace ', ' Thoracic ', ' Thorax ', ' Chest ', ' response ', ' Functional impairment ', ' functional disability ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Data Element ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Population Sciences ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' K-Awards ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' Cognitive ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Preparation ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' work group ', ' working group ', ' NHLBI ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' cost ', ' health related quality of life ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' analytical tool ', ' patient expectation ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy design ', ' Psychosocial Issues ', ' Psychosocial Influences ', ' health data ', ' Data Science ', ' BD2K ', ' Big Data to Knowledge ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' patient subsets ', ' Prospective cohort study ', ' Epidemiologic trend ', ' Epidemiology trend ', ' Epidemiological trend ', ' intervention cost ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' ']",NHLBI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K01,2020,170750,MD-07,0.4714740431485713
"Data-Driven Identification of the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This K01 proposal will complete Michael Sjoding, MD, MSc's training towards his long-term career goal of improving care of patients with acute respiratory disease. Dr. Sjoding is a Pulmonary and Critical Physician at the University of Michigan with master's level training in clinical study design and biostatistics. This proposal builds on Dr. Sjoding's prior expertise, providing protected time for additional training in data science, the technical methods for deriving new knowledge about human disease from “Big Biomedical Data” in the rich training environment at the University of Michigan. The project's research goal is to develop real-time systems to improve accuracy and timeliness of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) diagnosis using electronic health record data. ARDS is a critical illness syndrome affecting 200,000 people each year with high mortality. Under-recognition of this syndrome is the key barrier to providing evidence-based care to patients with ARDS. The research will be completed under the guidance of primary mentor Theodore J. Iwashyna, MD, PhD and co-mentors Timothy P. Hofer, MD, MSc, and Kayvan Najarian, PhD, and a scientific advisory board with additional expertise in data science and applied clinical informatics. The 5-year plan includes didactic coursework, mentored research, and professional development activities, with defined milestones to ensure successful transition to independence. The mentored research has 2 specific Aims: Aim 1. Develop a novel system for identifying ARDS digital signatures in electronic health data to accurately identify patients meeting ARDS criteria. Aim 2. Define the early natural history of developing ARDS, to more accurately predict patients' future ARDS risk. Both Aims will utilize rigorous 2-part designs, with the ARDS diagnostic and prediction models developed in the same retrospective cohort and validated in temporally distinct cohorts. In completing these high-level aims, the research will leverage high-resolution electronic health record and beside-monitoring device data to study ARDS with unprecedented detail, providing new insights into ARDS epidemiology and early natural history. This work will build to at least two R01 proposals: (1) testing the impact of a real-time electronic health record- based ARDS diagnostic system to improve evidence-based care practice, (2) defining ARDS subtypes using deep clinical phenotypic data. The work will build toward a programmatic line of research using high-resolution electronic health data to improve understanding of critical illness and respiratory disease. In completing this proposal, Dr. Sjoding will acquire unique computational expertise in data science methods, complementing his previous training, which he can then readily apply to address other research challenges in respiratory health. The ambitious but feasible training and mentored research proposed during this K01 award will allow him to achieve his goal of becoming an independent investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE The Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a critical illness syndrome affecting 200,000 people each year in intensive care units with a 30% mortality rate. To improve ARDS care, new approaches are urgently needed to improve ARDS identification—the critical first step to ensuring patients receive life-saving treatments.

"CTSA Administrative Supplement for Informatics Core: A novel AI/ML system to predict respiratory failure and ARDS in Covid-19 patients PROJECT SUMMARY The Einstein-Montefiore Institute for Clinical and Translational Research (ICTR) proposes an Administrative Supplement pursuant to NOT-TR-20-011, CTSA Program Applications to Address 2019 Novel Coronavirus (Covid-19). Specifically, this application addresses the urgent need for research on the coronavirus pandemic with a project focusing on informatics and data science to preemptively identify patients with the life- threatening complications of SARS-CoV-2, using CTSA-supported core resources. Characterized by severe hypoxemia, tachypnea, and decreased lung compliance, the diagnosis of acute respiratory failure (ARF) is a bad prognostic sign, and in a subset, leads to development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The rates of Covid-19 infection and death in the Bronx have been higher than any other borough of NYC. As the major regional health system, our experience with Covid-19 provides guideposts that may prevent future victims of this pandemic. The bleak picture for ARDS in the 4,452 patients admitted showed that 78% of our intubated Covid-19 patients developed ARDS, with 42% mortality. The overall goal of this proposal is to leverage our novel informatics and analytics platforms enabled by the Einstein-Montefiore CTSA (NIH/NCATS 1ULTR002556), and extensive Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning resources to implement a novel, situational awareness and clinical decision support system for ARF and ARDS (SA-ARDS). We will re-train our existing deep learning models with data collected from Covid-19 patients and contextualize its implementation with data from the Covid-19 response during the pandemic in NYC. The SA-ARDS data platform will provide longitudinally integrated clinical data for research and multi-institutional and national collaborations, with the following specific aims: Aim 1: To integrate, re-train, and validate our novel, near real-time, Electronic Risk Assessment System (ERAS 1.0) optimized for early recognition of ARF, ARDS, and inpatient mortality; Aim 2: To develop an evidence based, real-time, and context appropriate Situational Awareness clinical decision support system targeting ARF and ARDS response (SA-ARDS); and Aim 3: Through our partner CTSA organizations, to standardize and disseminate ERAS 1.0 and the SA-ARDS to other health systems, including the NYC consortium of CTSA hubs and the PCORI INSIGHT network. We will use the clinical data underlying the SA-ARDS to support research in local, regional, and national collaborations. All the methods and tools developed will be shared with the CTSA community via NCATS' National Center for Data to Health (CD2H). PROJECT NARRATIVE The US is in the midst of a public health crisis of the Covid-19 pandemic. We will create an artificial intelligence system to provide an early warning system optimized for recognition of ARF, ARDS, and inpatient mortality, and provide a base for application of artificial intelligence to detection of other debilitating and potentially fatal outcomes of Covid-19.",CTSA Administrative Supplement for Informatics Core: A novel AI/ML system to predict respiratory failure and ARDS in Covid-19 patients,10158737,UL1TR002556,"['preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Health system ', ' Administrative Supplement ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Research ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pandemic ', ' pandemic disease ', ' model of data ', ' model the data ', ' modeling of the data ', ' data modeling ', ' software systems ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' flu ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' evidence base ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' health data ', ' Data Science ', ' primary care provider ', ' care providers ', ' preemptive intervention ', ' deep learning ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' Data Scientist ', ' COVID19 ', ' corona virus disease 2019 ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 ', ' COVID-19 ', ' 2019 novel coronavirus ', ' SARS-CoV-2 ', ' SARS-CoV2 ', ' SARS-associated coronavirus 2 ', ' SARS-coronavirus-2 ', ' SARS-related coronavirus 2 ', ' Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ', ' Wuhan coronavirus ', ' 2019-nCoV ', ' complex data  ', ' COVID-19 epidemic ', ' COVID19 epidemic ', ' COVID19 pandemic ', ' corona virus disease 2019 epidemic ', ' corona virus disease 2019 pandemic ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic ', ' COVID-19 pandemic ', ' COVID ', ' CoV disease ', ' corona virus disease ', ' coronavirus disease ', ' rate of infection ', ' infection rate ', ' Arrhythmia ', ' Cardiac Arrhythmia ', ' Heart Arrhythmias ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Award ', ' Awareness ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communities ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Engineering ', ' Expert Systems ', ' Intelligent systems ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heart Injuries ', ' cardiac injury ', ' Hospitals ', ' Infection ', ' Inpatients ', ' Institutes ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Literature ', ' Lung Compliance ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' New York City ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Pneumonia ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Research Support ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome ', ' ARDS ', ' Acute Respiratory Distress ', ' Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ', ' Adult ARDS ', ' Adult RDS ', ' Da Nang Lung ', ' Shock Lung ', ' Stiff lung ', ' wet lung ', ' Seasons ', ' Software Engineering ', ' Computer Software Development ', ' Computer Software Engineering ', ' Standardization ', ' Thromboembolism ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Upper Respiratory Infections ', ' Upper Respiratory Tract Infection ', ' Generations ', ' Competence ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' kidney injury ', ' renal injury ', ' Injury to Kidney ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' mechanical respiratory assist ', ' Mechanical ventilation ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Fatal Outcome ', ' Coronaviridae ', ' corona virus ', ' Coronavirus ', ' Link ', ' prognostic ', ' Training ', ' Funding ', ' Acute respiratory failure ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Clinical Decision Support Systems ', ' Medical center ', ' experience ', ' care delivery ', ' cohort ', ' Informatics ', ' novel ', ' hypoxemic ', ' Hypoxemia ', ' Deterioration ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' pulmonary failure ', ' respiratory insufficiency/failure ', ' Respiratory Failure ', ' ']",NCATS,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,UL1,2020,1003424,NY-14,0.41175084308518567
"A Real-Time Computational System for Detecting ARDS Using Ventilator Waveform Data Project Summary:  Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a severe form of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure affecting 10% of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) in the United States. In-hospital mortality of 35-46% has been reported across the spectrum of mild-severe ARDS, and one third of patients with initially mild ARDS will progress to moderate or severe ARDS. Over the last 20 years, multiple studies have reported improved outcomes for ARDS patients using specific ARDS targeted therapies. However, ARDS remains persistently under-recognized and challenging to diagnose. Only one third of ICU providers correctly identify ARDS on the first day when diagnostic criteria are met, and less than two thirds ever recognize the diagnosis in the ICU. This under recognition of ARDS may prevent some patients from receiving lifesaving therapies necessary for treating the disease. Attempts to automate ARDS diagnosis using rule- based algorithms have seen limited success, and require analysis of subjective data from patient histories, like chest scans, which limit diagnosis automation, timeliness, and study reproducibility.  To improve the current state of the art of ARDS detection technology, we intend to utilize objective and readily available data including both ventilator waveform data, (VWD) and electronic health record (EMR) data to 1) improve the recognition of ARDS, and 2) identify high-risk ARDS patients most likely to benefit from additional ARDS treatments. For this task, we will make use of an existing dataset of VWD from over 500 patients receiving mechanical ventilation, including 156 patients with confirmed ARDS. Our preliminary analyses using a machine learned model and a subset of lung physiology features derived solely from VWD, suggest that ARDS can be diagnosed in the absence of a chest scan or medical history. In Aim 1 of this proposal, we will improve our existing model used for discriminating ARDS by adding objective EMR data, and additional features extracted from VWD, such as patient respiratory compliance and airway resistance. Our next focus will be to predict worsening of ARDS severity in intubated patients based on Berlin criteria. So in Aim 2, we will evaluate the best tools for predicting increases in ARDS severity, and which types of temporal information yield the best predictive results.  We hypothesize that model development using additional objective data derived from VWD analysis and the EMR, along with advanced analytic techniques, will further improve ARDS diagnosis, and enable the prediction of clinical trajectories in patients with ARDS. The proposed work will yield innovative clinical decision support models that can be used to improve the state of the art in automated ARDS diagnosis. Our predictive modeling will also enable greater insight into the times when physicians can perform clinical interventions to arrest ARDS induced physiologic deterioration. Ultimately, these innovations could save lives by quickly detecting ARDS, and alerting physicians to begin or intensify ARDS focused therapies based on patient pathophysiologic state. Project Narrative: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a highly lethal disease contracted by over 100,000 Americans each year. We seek to address whether we can create automated technologies to detect onset and change in severity of ARDS in critically ill patients using widely available ventilator waveform data. With these automated diagnostic testing technologies, doctors can promptly deliver necessary treatments for ARDS before the disease worsens.",A Real-Time Computational System for Detecting ARDS Using Ventilator Waveform Data,9980981,F31HL144028,"['Affect ', ' Airway Resistance ', ' Algorithms ', ' Automation ', ' Berlin ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Critical Illness ', ' Critically Ill ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Intensive Care Units ', ' Learning ', ' Lung ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' pulmonary ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Physiology ', ' Research ', ' Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome ', ' ARDS ', ' Acute Respiratory Distress ', ' Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ', ' Adult ARDS ', ' Adult RDS ', ' Da Nang Lung ', ' Shock Lung ', ' Stiff lung ', ' wet lung ', ' Savings ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Hospital Mortality ', ' In-house Mortalities ', ' Inhospital Mortality ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' Decision Support Model ', ' Ventilator ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' mechanical respiratory assist ', ' Mechanical ventilation ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Phase ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Series ', ' prognostic ', ' insight ', ' Discipline ', ' Personal Medical History ', ' Personal Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Medical History ', ' Acute respiratory failure ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Contracts ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Hour ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Scanning ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' respiratory ', ' American ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' computer science ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' hypoxemic ', ' Hypoxemia ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Thorace ', ' Thoracic ', ' Thorax ', ' Chest ', ' Deterioration ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' model development ', ' Provider ', ' pulmonary failure ', ' respiratory insufficiency/failure ', ' Respiratory Failure ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Reproducibility ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' markov model ', ' adjudicate ', ' Outcome ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' computer algorithm ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' high risk ', ' clinical predictors ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapy ', ' targeted treatment ', ' improved outcome ', ' predictive tools ', ' clinical translation ', ' high dimensionality ', ' clinical decision support ', ' recurrent neural network ', ' deep learning ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' advanced analytics ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,F31,2020,15376,CA-03,0.5692053992432872
