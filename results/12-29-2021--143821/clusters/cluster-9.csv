"New Computational Methods for Data-driven Protein Structure Prediction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proteins play a central role in all biological processes. Akin to the complete sequencing of genomes, complete description of protein structures is a fundamental step towards understanding biological life, and is also highly relevant medically in the development of therapeutics and drugs. The broad, long-term goal of the project is to develop machine learning methods for data-driven protein structure prediction through two independent but complementary strategies: 1) much more accurate template-based modeling for proteins with remote homologs in the Protein Data Bank and 2) better template-free modeling method for proteins without detectable templates and for improving template-based models. The specific aims are: Aim 1) to greatly improve template-based modeling by 1a) improving protein sequence-template alignment using a regression-tree-based nonlinear scoring function, especially when good sequence profiles are unavailable; and 1b) improving fold recognition using a machine learning method to combine both residue-level and atom-level features; Aim 2) to improve protein conformation sampling in a continuous space and thus template-free modeling by three independent but complementary approaches: 2a) modeling nonlinear sequence- structure relationship using Conditional (Markov) Random Fields (CRF) models; 2b) simultaneously sampling secondary and tertiary structure; and 2c) learning structure information from template. The core of the project is to develop various CRF models for data-driven protein structure prediction, by learning protein sequence-structure relationship from existing sequence/structure databases. The product of this research includes a regression-tree-based CRF model for accurate protein alignment, especially for proteins without close homologs in the PDB or without very good sequence profiles; a SVM model for protein fold recognition; a few CRF models for efficient protein conformation sampling in a continuous space; and a complete protein structure prediction software package. Also, it will produce a web server publicly available for various academic and biomedical users. Protein structure prediction will lead to a broad range of biomedical applications, such as the development of novel diagnostics, better understanding of disease processes and improved preventive therapies leading to reduced health care costs. Protein modeling is also widely applied in the pharmaceutical industry and integrated into most stages of pharmaceutical research.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:       Novel protein structure prediction will lead to a broad range of biomedical applications, such as the development of novel diagnostics, better understanding of disease processes and improved preventive therapies leading to reduced health care costs.

"A Wireless Multiscale Distributed Interface to the Cortex    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The development of advanced neuroprosthetic systems and brain-machine interfaces for high-capacity, real-time, bi-directional communication with the nervous system is a major challenge to the emerging neural engineering discipline.  While recent advances in the fabrication of high-density microelectrode arrays (HDMEAs) for multiunit recording and stimulation have triggered numerous neurobiological discoveries, the resulting large data throughput and the variability of cortical responses over repeated trials preclude the ability to design a wireless, adaptive, fully implantable large-scale interface to the cortex.  This severely limits the feasibility and space of experimental paradigms needed to improve our understanding of the nervous system functionality and characterize cortical responses in freely behaving subjects interacting naturally with their surroundings.  The objective of this project is to develop a wireless interface to the cortex capable of processing simultaneously recorded neural signalsfrom 64 electrode channels in real time.  The project has 3 aims:  1.  Develop advanced signal processing algorithms for sensing and decoding neuronal response properties from distributed intra-cortical neural activity:  1) Optimize our existing signal processing algorithms for hardware implementation to extract the desired neural activity early in the data stream; 2) Develop new algorithms for decoding these responses to characterize the natural behavior of awake, behaving animal models.  2.  Design low-power integrated circuits and wireless telemetry for a 64 channel system:  1) Optimize the design of a low power Neural Interface Node (NIN) module to feature wireless communication and powering capability for subcutaneous implantation; 2) Design and fabricate an extracranial Manager Interface Module (MIM) to permit:  a) wireless powering and data exchange with up to 2 implanted NIN modules; b) wireless bidirectional exchange of data and control with a central base station.  3.  Demonstrate the system functionality in vitro and vivo:  1) Build a 32 channel system and test its performance in vitro in retinal slices and in vivo in awake behaving rodents; 2) Demonstrate the real time functionality of a 64 channel system in vitro and explore its feasibility in vivo; 3) Optimize the entire system design, and benchmark it against a commercial 64 channel wired data acquisition system.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This project seeks to develop a wireless electronic microsystem to be implanted in the rat brain to continuously monitor neural signals when the rat is freely behaving in an open environment.  This system will help understand how brain cells process information.  This will help design assistive technology for people with severe paralysis.       ",A Wireless Multiscale Distributed Interface to the Cortex,7903986,R01NS062031,"['computerized data processing ', ' signal processing ', ' data processing ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Electrodes ', ' Electronics ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' in vivo ', ' Rodent Model ', ' Slice ', ' Wireless Technology ', ' wireless ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' density ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' improved ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Algorithms ', ' Area ', ' In Vitro ', ' disability ', ' Learning ', ' Stimulus ', ' awake ', ' Discipline ', ' Microelectrodes ', ' Miniaturized Electrodes ', ' Nervous system structure ', ' Neurologic Organ System ', ' Neurologic Body System ', ' Nervous System ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurons ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Animals ', ' Perception ', ' tool ', ' Rattus ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Rat ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Research ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Rodentia ', ' Self-Help Devices ', ' assistive device ', ' Assistive Technology ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Computer software ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Telemetry ', ' Telemetries ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Investigation ', ' Stream ', ' subcutaneous ', ' Sensory ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Behavior ', ' Paralysed ', ' paralytic ', ' paralysis ', ' Plegia ', ' Palsy ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' brain cell ', ' Performance ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Devices ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' neural circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' Cavia ', ' Guinea Pigs Mammals ', ' Guinea Pigs ', ' Mediating ', ' Property ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' response ', ' Communication ', ' microsystems ', ' Advanced Development ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' quantum ', ' Outcome ', ' brain machine interface ', ' Retinal ', ' Imaging technology ', ' Population ', ' data acquisition ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' Implant ', ' implantation ', ' prototype ', ' information processing ', ' public health relevance ', ' data exchange ', ' data transmission ', ' operation ', ' ']",NINDS,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2010,511198,MI-08,-0.007309925954977565
"Enabling Population-Scale Physical Activity Measurement on Common Mobile Phones    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The primary aim of this U01 project is the technical development, deployment, and evaluation of hardware and software technology that will enable population-scale, longitudinal measurement of physical activity using common mobile phones. Mobile phones available in Asia and soon in the U.S. already include internal accelerometers and low-power wireless communication capabilities. This study will investigate how to use these computing devices for accurate measurement of physical activity type, intensity and bout duration. By exploiting consumer expenditures on phones that many Americans will purchase, maintain, and carry, it may be possible to run large-scale studies where the physical activity of hundreds of thousands of participants is measured and remotely monitored for months or years at an affordable cost. Wireless accelerometers designed at MIT will be redesigned so that they can send data to common mobile phones available in 2011. Laboratory testing using the current version of the sensors will be used to compare the relative information gain that can be obtained by combining the phone accelerometer data and data obtained by wearing one or more wireless sensors on different convenient body locations (e.g., in a watch or bag, on a shoe, at the hip, etc.). Optimal but practical configurations of accelerometers will be determined so that software running on the mobile phone can automatically detect specific physical activities such as brisk walking, running, cycling, climbing stairs, sweeping, playing sports, etc. Technical challenges that will be addressed by the sensor and software design include, (1) obtaining practical battery life, (2) acquiring physical activity data at high temporal resolution, (3) enabling person-specific customization of the detection algorithms, (4) addressing practical end-user concerns about ergonomics, comfort, and social acceptability, (5) permitting real-time and low-cost remote monitoring and maintenance for studies with hundreds of thousands of phone users, and (4) enabling use of other off-the-shelf sensor devices, such as heart rate monitors, as they become available. A participatory design process will be employed to develop strategies for obtaining longitudinal compliance from typical phone users. After two rounds of iterative technical development, each with laboratory validation conducted at Stanford, the technology will be deployed with 50 typical phone users for 10 months. Validity relative to self report, acceptability, and longitudinal compliance will be measured.          ",Enabling Population-Scale Physical Activity Measurement on Common Mobile Phones,7895863,U01HL091737,"['Running ', ' Shoes ', ' Computer software ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Software Design ', ' Designing computer software ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Life ', ' Sports ', ' Technology ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Asia ', ' Time ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Frequency ', ' Side ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Location ', ' American ', ' Participant ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Devices ', ' social ', ' Measures ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Walking ', ' ergonomics ', ' Sampling ', ' software development ', ' developing computer software ', ' develop software ', ' Communication ', ' cost ', ' software systems ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Physical activity scale ', ' Population ', ' open source ', ' remote sensor ', ' prototype ', ' Data Collection ', ' Car Phone ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Resolution ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Validation ', ' Wireless Technology ', ' wireless ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Expenditure ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Goals ', ' sensor ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Hip region structure ', ' Hip ', ' Coxa ', ' Algorithms ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Laboratories ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Maintenance ', ' Marketing ', ' Motion ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Internet ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' ']",NHLBI,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,U01,2010,534121,MA-07,0.014764058518731986
"Clinical Image Retrieval: User needs assessment, toolbox development & evaluation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Advances in digital imaging technologies have led to a substantial growth in the number of digital images being created and stored in hospitals, medical systems, and on the Internet in recent years. Effective medical image retrieval systems can play an important role in teaching, research, diagnosis and treatment. Images were historically retrieved using text-based methods. The quality of annotations associated with images can reduce the effectiveness of text-based image retrieval. Despite recent advances, purely content- based image retrieval techniques lag significantly behind their textual counterparts in their ability to capture the semantic essence of the user's query. Preliminary research suggests that a more promising approach is to adaptively combine these complementary techniques to suit the user and their information needs. However, for these approaches to succeed, the researcher needs to enhance her computational skills in addition to acquiring a comprehensive understanding of the relevant clinical domain. This Pathway to Independence (K99/R00) grant application describes a training and career development plan that will allow the candidate, an NLM postdoctoral fellow in Medical Informatics at Oregon Health & Science University to achieve these objectives. The training component will be carried out under the mentorship of Dr. W. Hersh with Dr. Gorman (user studies). Dr. Fuss (radiation medicine) and Dr. Erdogmus (machine learning) providing additional mentoring in their areas of expertise.       The long-term goal of this Pathway to Independence (K99/R00) project is to improve visual information retrieval by better understanding user needs and proposing adaptive methodologies for multimodal image retrieval that will close the semantic gap. During the award period, activities will be focused on the following specific aims: (1) Understand the image retrieval needs of novice and expert users in radiation oncology and develop gold standards for evaluation; (2) Develop algorithms for semantic, multimodal image retrieval; (3) Perform user based evaluation of adaptive image retrieval in radiation oncology; (4) Extend the techniques developed to create a multimodal image retrieval system in pathology          ","Clinical Image Retrieval: User needs assessment, toolbox development & evaluation",7921476,K99LM009889,"['Diagnosis ', ' Diagnostic Imaging ', ' Diffusion ', ' Effectiveness ', ' data mining ', ' datamining ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Address ', ' Affinity ', ' Data ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Multimodal Imaging ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' NCI Organization ', ' Retrieval ', ' Ontology ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Text ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Feedback ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Output ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Au element ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' improved ', ' Hospitals ', ' Algorithms ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Institutes ', ' Interview ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Judgment ', ' Learning ', ' Visual ', ' Libraries ', ' Lung ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' satisfaction ', ' Development Plans ', ' Radiation Oncology ', ' Maps ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Medical Informatics ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Metric System ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' oncology ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' Head and Neck Cancer ', ' malignant head and neck tumor ', ' Malignant Head and Neck Neoplasm ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic ', ' Internet ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Online Systems ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Oregon ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' Quality Control ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Nature ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Semantics ', ' Archives ', ' Computer software ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Arts ', ' Students ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Vocabulary ', ' Vocabulary Words ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Award ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' meetings ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' digital imaging ', ' computer imaging ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' care delivery ', ' treatment planning ', ' Distance Learning ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Reporting ', ' Information Retrieval ', ' Measures ', ' Pathology Report ', ' Radiation ', ' ray (radiation) ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' Property ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' cancer site ', ' cancer location ', ' Accounting ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' biomedical informatics ', ' biomed informatics ', ' Imaging technology ', ' Image retrieval system ', ' open source ', ' visual information ', ' ']",NLM,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,K99,2010,110591,OR-03,0.03852502191209953
"Human Variation Detection and Visualization on the DNAnexus Web 2.0 platform    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): DNAnexus proposes to develop a complete solution for the identification and stratification of personal genetic variation from ultra-high-throughput sequencing projects. The solution will be implemented as a Web 2.0 service and online browsing tool that will integrate public data sources such as the 1000 genomes project, comparative information, and the ENCODE II project data. Users will be able to browse and stratify the identified variation in the context of these genomic annotations, and according to the likely functional impact. In Phase I of our project, we will develop a basic browser for displaying sequence reads that are mapped to a reference genome with our state-of-the-art read mapper. The browser will support viewing mate paired reads as well as display of the variation between these reads and the reference genome. It will facilitate the algorithmic development that we will perform during Phase II, and it will be the foundation for the more sophisticated variation browser also proposed in Phase II. In Phase II, we will develop algorithms for detecting genomic variation, and a state-of-the-art browser for viewing variation in the context of existing genome annotations, functional genomic and comparative genomic data. Our algorithms for detecting variation will support all major types of genomic variation, including SNPs, microindels, larger insertions and deletions, duplications, copy number variations, inversions, and translocations. Our algorithms will be based on state-of-the-art statistical and machine learning methodology for human genome resequencing. The DNAnexus browser will have two components: a list browser that displays variation as a list filtered and stratified by criteria that a user chooses, and a powerful GUI whose navigation capabilities are inspired by modern online tools such as Google Maps.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: DNAnexus proposes to develop a complete solution for identifying and analyzing personal genetic variation for individuals whose genomes are sequenced using new sequencing technologies.

"Continued development of CellProfiler cell image analysis software Most laboratories studying biological processes and human disease use light/fluorescence microscopes to image cells and other biological samples. There is strong and growing demand for software to analyze these images, as automated microscopes collect images faster than can be examined by eye and the information sought from images is increasingly quantitative and complex.  We have begun to address this demand with CellProfiler, a versatile, open-source software tool for quantifying data from biological images, particularly in high-throughput experiments (www.cellprofiler.org). CellProfiler can extract valuable biological information from images quickly while increasing the objectivity and statistical power of assays. In the three years since its release, it has become widely used, having been downloaded more than 8,000 times by users in over 60 countries. Using CellProfiler's point-and-click interface, researchers build a customized chain of image analysis modules to identify and measure biological objects in images. The software evolved in an intensely collaborative and interdisciplinary research environment with dozens of ongoing projects and has been successfully applied to a wide range of biological samples and assays, from counting cells to scoring complex phenotypes by machine learning.  To enable further biological imaging research, meet the needs of the growing user base, and expand the community that benefits from CellProfiler, we propose to improve its capabilities, interface, and support:  First, we will add user-requested capabilities, leveraging existing open-source projects by interoperating with them where feasible. These new features will include object tracking in time-lapse movies, compatibility with additional file formats, new image processing algorithms, and expanded tools for quality control, performance evaluation, cluster computing, and workflow management.  Second, we will improve the interface, increase processing speed, and simplify the addition of new features by refactoring and porting the MATLAB-based code to an open-source language and instituting proven software development practices.  Third, we will provide user, educator, and developer support and outreach for CellProfiler. These activities will facilitate research in the scientific community and help guide usability improvements.  These improvements to the only open-source software for modular, high-throughput biological image analysis will enable hundreds of NIH-funded laboratories to make high-impact biological discoveries from cell images across all disciplines within biology. Most laboratories studying biological processes and human disease use microscopy to analyze cells and  other samples. We will enable these researchers to rapidly and accurately extract numerical data from  microscopy images by continuing to develop and support our user-friendly, open-source cell image  analysis software, CellProfiler (www.cellprofiler.org).",Continued development of CellProfiler cell image analysis software,7761085,R01GM089652,"['Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Email ', ' E-Mail ', ' Electronic Mail ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Whole Organism ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cell imaging ', ' cellular imaging ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' Grant ', ' Microscope ', ' improved ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Algorithms ', ' Biological ', ' Institutes ', ' Evaluation ', ' Laboratories ', ' Language ', ' Libraries ', ' Discipline ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Manuals ', ' Microscopy ', ' Persons ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' Paper ', ' Phenotype ', ' tool ', ' Quality Control ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Software Tools ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Stains ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Country ', ' Stainings ', ' Staining method ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biology ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' meetings ', ' processing speed ', ' Performance ', ' resource guides ', ' Speed ', ' Speed (motion) ', ' movie ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Laboratory Study ', ' outreach ', ' laboratory fluorescence light microscope ', ' fluorescent microscope ', ' fluorescence/UV microscope ', ' Ultraviolet Microscopes ', ' UV laboratory microscope ', ' fluorescence microscope ', ' Metric ', ' Cell Number ', ' Cell Count ', ' Cells ', ' Measures ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Process Measure ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' repository ', ' developing computer software ', ' develop software ', ' software development ', ' Communities ', ' grid computing ', ' distributed computing ', ' datagrid ', ' data grid ', ' computational grid ', ' cluster computing ', ' interoperability ', ' file format ', ' user-friendly ', ' web interface ', ' open source ', ' human disease ', ' usability ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NIGMS,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",R01,2010,463608,MA-07,0.025239184008395133
"A mobile Enabling Technology to promote adherence to behavioral therapy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses broad Challenge Area (06) Enabling Technologies, 06-DA-105: Improving health through ICT/mobile technologies. The ultimate goal of this research is to fundamentally change the ways in which behavioral interventions are delivered. We propose an innovative mobile Enabling Technology-iHeal-that recognizes stressors that threaten a patient's recovery and then delivers evidence-based interventions exactly at the moment of greatest need. Our objective is to determine, within subjects, the extent to which physiologic and affective changes detected by iHeal are predictive, within subjects, of posttraumatic stress or drug cues. The study team has considerable expertise in technology development and in assessment of behavioral interventions in co-occurring disorders. We will study 25 subjects drawn from an existing SAMHSA-funded investigation that utilizes intense case management to monitor progression of PTSD and substance abuse in returning combat veterans. Our proposed investigation will share interventions with the SMAHSA study that are based upon a blending of Motivational Interviewing and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy approaches for PTSD and substance abuse. Specific aims: 1) To evaluate the accuracy with which iHeal characterizes physiological and affective phenomena as acute stress reactions related to PTSD and environmental drug cues; and 2) To evaluate the effect of Motivational Interviewing-based interventions on acute stress reactions related to PTSD and environmental drug cues. This initial proposal is extremely innovative. The proposed iHeal device will employ cutting-edge wireless technology to link wearable sensors to personal mobile computing platforms (e.g., iPhone). This linkage will allow iHeal to detect co-occurring biological and behavioral processes, while embedded computing in the mobile platform permits iHeal to deliver evidence-based empathetic interventions at the opportune moment. iHeal can learn to intervene in ways that are most effective for the user, including scripted text-based dialogues modeled after brief interventions; use of motivating images or messages from loved ones; playing a meaningful song; or contacting a counselor at the moment of greatest need. Ultimately, a wearable wireless device that anticipates stressors and intervenes at a likely transition to risky activities has enormous potential in a variety of social, behavioral, and biomedical research enterprises. Importantly, iHeal has immediate commercial applications that will encourage job growth in behavioral science, biomedical, computer science, telecommunication, and electrical engineering enterprises. iHeal is an innovative device that uses wearable sensors to detect pulse, skin conductance, and acceleration; the sensor array links wirelessly to an iPhone which has an app that identifies changes in the user's physiology. Changes consistent with acute stress from PTSD exacerbations or drug use cues generate an empathetic conversation between the iPhone and the user, who enters real-time data on social/behavioral/environmental contexts. The iPhone (which tracks time and GPS data) uses predictive software to anticipate upcoming stressors and helps the user avoid them. The public health significance of this proposal is 1) iHeal will detect co-occurring biological and behavioral processes in real time; 2) it will discern undiscovered behavioral states; 3) it will predict a behavior of interest; and 4) it will deliver empathetic interventions to the user at the opportune moment for intervention. Because it is based on the union of existing technology and has immediate commercial applications, iHeal will encourage job growth in behavioral science, biomedical, computer science, telecommunication, and electrical engineering enterprises.               Project Narrative iHeal is an innovative device that uses wearable sensors to detect pulse, skin conductance, and acceleration; the sensor array links wirelessly to an iPhone which has an app that identifies changes in the user's physiology.

"The Development of a Noninvasive Monitoring System for Cigarette Smoking    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in the United States. Smoking produces over 440,000 deaths each year in this country and generates an estimated $167 billion in annual health-related economic losses. Available methods of smoking assessment (e.g., self-report, portable puff-topography instruments) do not permit the collection of accurate, non-reactive measures of smoking behavior that capture real-time smoking frequency and comprehensive within-cigarette puff topography. The objective of this project is to develop a non-invasive wearable system (Personal Automatic Cigarette Tracker - PACT) that is completely transparent to the end user and does not require any conscience effort to achieve reliable monitoring of smoking behavior in free living individuals. Methodologically, PACT will consist of two major components: 1. Wearable sensors. Miniature sensors integrated into the clothing will monitors the breathing and activity patterns of individuals. The signals from the sensors will be processed and recognized to identify and objectively characterize each individual puff. 2. Software for signal processing and pattern recognition. Automatic computer software will analyze sensor signals and detect patterns uniquely identifying smoking events. Objective metrics such as number of puffs and inter-puff interval will be extracted. The software will be based on the state-of-art machine learning methods. The development of the PACT system will be addressed in four specific aims: Specific Aim 1: Develop a wearable sensor system comprised of a breathing sensor integrated into conventional underwear and a hand gesture sensor integrated into a hand bracelet. Specific Aim 2: Collect sensor data from individuals wearing the instrumented system and performing everyday activities (including smoking) in laboratory conditions. Specific Aim 3: Develop pattern recognition methods to recognize individual puffs and smoke inhalation. Specific Aim 4: Evaluate the utility and sensitivity of the wearable sensor PACT system and pattern recognition method in people smoking in the natural environment.

"Coding of auditory space in the avian brain    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): All auditory information used for sound localization ascends through the brainstem auditory nuclei. We will use physiological and theoretical approaches to understand how multidimensional features of sound, relevant to sound localization, are processed and encoded in the avian auditory brainstem. A primary advantage of using barn owls for the exploration of auditory processing is the substantial body of behavioral, anatomical and neurophysiological work that has elucidated the mechanisms of sound localization. The main cues owls use to compute sound direction are the interaural level difference (ILD) and the interaural time difference (ITD). Unlike mammals, owls use ILD to determine the vertical coordinate of the sound source and ITD to determine the horizontal coordinate. Two independent brainstem pathways process ITD and ILD and converge in the midbrain, where a spatiotopic map of auditory space emerges. Activity of neurons in the map precedes, and stimulation evokes, a head-orienting response towards the sound source. Thus, in barn owls, the neural algorithm for sound localization can be viewed as a system in which two input variables (ITD and ILD) are processed in parallel in order to control two output variables (horizontal and vertical coordinates of head saccades). We have used theoretical models to describe the neural responses that encode spatial information in the owl's auditory system. This approach has guided our experiments and aided the interpretation of our findings. Behavioral experiments in humans have used a similar approach to sound localization. However, due to a lack of neural data in humans, the predictive power of models of sound localization with regard to the neural bases of behavior has been a persistent question. Our studies in barn owls address this issue by investigating the mechanism of neural computations that are fundamental to models developed for human sound localization. This proposal is organized around three primary questions: 1) What are the computational primitives of auditory-space processing in the owl's brainstem? 2) How is spectrotemporal information encoded, transmitted and processed in parallel with spatial information? 3) What fundamental changes in information coding occur at the crossroads between the auditory midbrain and forebrain? We will address these questions using a wide range of strategies and techniques - intracellular in vivo recordings, cell-attached recording in vivo, multi-neuron tetrode recording, and modeling - which will make our approach interdisciplinary and of broad scope. Our research seeks to understand the function of the auditory brainstem and midbrain. In doing so, we will identify the types of information that are available to upstream nuclei and show how this information is encoded. A comprehensive approach to information processing in the auditory brainstem has the potential to provide new avenues for better understanding disorders of the central auditory system and cognitive impairments involving hearing. By linking biology and engineering, mathematical formulations of brain processes can advance technology related to robotics and neural prosthetics. Cochlear implants that provide encoding of stimuli in ways that are more biologically relevant can be built, while devices acting downstream of the cochlea could aid patients with compromised or non-functional auditory nerves. By its differences and similarities with other species, the avian brain provides an excellent model system to define fundamental properties of neural processing and neural coding.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research will test hypotheses based on human models, of how the auditory system computes sound direction. This approach has the potential of providing new avenues for better understanding disorders of the central auditory system and cognitive impairments involving hearing. By linking biology and engineering, mathematical formulations of brain processes can advance technology related to artificial intelligence and neural prosthetics; smarter cochlear implants can be built, as well as devices acting downstream of the cochlea could aid patients with compromised or non-functional auditory nerves.           The proposed research will test hypotheses based on human models, of how the auditory system computes sound direction.

"Continued development of CellProfiler cell image analysis software    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        Most laboratories studying biological processes and human disease use light/fluorescence microscopes to image cells and other biological samples. There is strong and growing demand for software to analyze these images, as automated microscopes collect images faster than can be examined by eye and the information sought from images is increasingly quantitative and complex.  We have begun to address this demand with CellProfiler, a versatile, open-source software tool for quantifying data from biological images, particularly in high-throughput experiments (www.cellprofiler.org). CellProfiler can extract valuable biological information from images quickly while increasing the objectivity and statistical power of assays. In the three years since its release, it has become widely used, having been downloaded more than 8,000 times by users in over 60 countries. Using CellProfiler's point-and-click interface, researchers build a customized chain of image analysis modules to identify and measure biological objects in images. The software evolved in an intensely collaborative and interdisciplinary research environment with dozens of ongoing projects and has been successfully applied to a wide range of biological samples and assays, from counting cells to scoring complex phenotypes by machine learning.  To enable further biological imaging research, meet the needs of the growing user base, and expand the community that benefits from CellProfiler, we propose to improve its capabilities, interface, and support:  First, we will add user-requested capabilities, leveraging existing open-source projects by interoperating with them where feasible. These new features will include object tracking in time-lapse movies, compatibility with additional file formats, new image processing algorithms, and expanded tools for quality control, performance evaluation, cluster computing, and workflow management.  Second, we will improve the interface, increase processing speed, and simplify the addition of new features by refactoring and porting the MATLAB-based code to an open-source language and instituting proven software development practices.  Third, we will provide user, educator, and developer support and outreach for CellProfiler. These activities will facilitate research in the scientific community and help guide usability improvements.  These improvements to the only open-source software for modular, high-throughput biological image analysis will enable hundreds of NIH-funded laboratories to make high-impact biological discoveries from cell images across all disciplines within biology.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:           Most laboratories studying biological processes and human disease use microscopy to analyze cells and  other samples.

"A Study of Social Web Data on Buprenorphine Abuse Using Semantic Web Technology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The non-medical use of pharmaceutical opioids has been identified as one of the fastest growing forms of drug abuse in the U.S. There is a critical need to enhance current epidemiological monitoring, early warning, and post-marketing surveillance systems by providing additional and more timely data. The World Wide Web has been identified as one of the ""leading edge"" data sources for detecting patterns and changes in drug use practices. Many websites provide a venue for individuals to freely share their own experiences, post questions, and offer comments about different drugs. Such User Generated Content (UGC) can be used as a very rich data source to study knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to illicit drugs. To harness the full potential of the Web for drug abuse research, the field needs to develop a highly automated way of accessing, extracting, and analyzing Web-based data related to illicit drug use. This exploratory R21 is a multi-principal investigator, collaborative effort between researchers at the Center for Interventions, Treatment and Addictions Research (CITAR) and the Center for Knowledge-Enabled Information Services and Science (Kno.e.sis) at Wright State University. The purpose of this Web-based study is to apply cutting-edge information processing techniques, such as the Semantic Web, Natural Language Processing, and Machine Learning, to qualitative and quantitative content analysis of user generated content to achieve the following aims: 1) Describe drug users' knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to the illicit use of Suboxone(R) (buprenorphine/naloxone) and Subutex(R) (buprenorphine); 2) Identify and describe temporal patterns of the illicit use of these drugs as reflected on web-based forums. To collect data, the study will use websites that allow for the free discussion of illicit drugs, contain information on illicit prescription drug use, and are accessible for public viewing. The study will generate new information about the practices of buprenorphine abuse and will contribute to the advancement of public health and substance abuse research by providing automatic coding and information extraction tools needed to handle rapidly growing Web-based data.

"Coding of auditory space in the avian brain    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): All auditory information used for sound localization ascends through the brainstem auditory nuclei. We will use physiological and theoretical approaches to understand how multidimensional features of sound, relevant to sound localization, are processed and encoded in the avian auditory brainstem. A primary advantage of using barn owls for the exploration of auditory processing is the substantial body of behavioral, anatomical and neurophysiological work that has elucidated the mechanisms of sound localization. The main cues owls use to compute sound direction are the interaural level difference (ILD) and the interaural time difference (ITD). Unlike mammals, owls use ILD to determine the vertical coordinate of the sound source and ITD to determine the horizontal coordinate. Two independent brainstem pathways process ITD and ILD and converge in the midbrain, where a spatiotopic map of auditory space emerges. Activity of neurons in the map precedes, and stimulation evokes, a head-orienting response towards the sound source. Thus, in barn owls, the neural algorithm for sound localization can be viewed as a system in which two input variables (ITD and ILD) are processed in parallel in order to control two output variables (horizontal and vertical coordinates of head saccades). We have used theoretical models to describe the neural responses that encode spatial information in the owl's auditory system. This approach has guided our experiments and aided the interpretation of our findings. Behavioral experiments in humans have used a similar approach to sound localization. However, due to a lack of neural data in humans, the predictive power of models of sound localization with regard to the neural bases of behavior has been a persistent question. Our studies in barn owls address this issue by investigating the mechanism of neural computations that are fundamental to models developed for human sound localization. This proposal is organized around three primary questions: 1) What are the computational primitives of auditory-space processing in the owl's brainstem? 2) How is spectrotemporal information encoded, transmitted and processed in parallel with spatial information? 3) What fundamental changes in information coding occur at the crossroads between the auditory midbrain and forebrain? We will address these questions using a wide range of strategies and techniques - intracellular in vivo recordings, cell-attached recording in vivo, multi-neuron tetrode recording, and modeling - which will make our approach interdisciplinary and of broad scope. Our research seeks to understand the function of the auditory brainstem and midbrain. In doing so, we will identify the types of information that are available to upstream nuclei and show how this information is encoded. A comprehensive approach to information processing in the auditory brainstem has the potential to provide new avenues for better understanding disorders of the central auditory system and cognitive impairments involving hearing. By linking biology and engineering, mathematical formulations of brain processes can advance technology related to robotics and neural prosthetics. Cochlear implants that provide encoding of stimuli in ways that are more biologically relevant can be built, while devices acting downstream of the cochlea could aid patients with compromised or non-functional auditory nerves. By its differences and similarities with other species, the avian brain provides an excellent model system to define fundamental properties of neural processing and neural coding.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research will test hypotheses based on human models, of how the auditory system computes sound direction. This approach has the potential of providing new avenues for better understanding disorders of the central auditory system and cognitive impairments involving hearing.

"Longitudinal Assessment of Fall Risk    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Falling is not a normal part of the aging process and yet 1/3 to 1/2 of adults 65 years and older sustain at least one fall annually. Older adults are hospitalized for fall related injuries five times more often than from injuries from other causes contributing to a cost of $19 billion for nonfatal falls in the United States. Projected for the increasing aging population in the year 2020, it is expected that the costs related to falls will reach a staggering 54.9 billion dollars. Current research and clinical practice guidelines focus on multifactorial fall risk assessments as the critical deterrent to falls in the elderly. A primary factor within these assessments is activity of daily living performance of the individual elder. While current standardized clinical balance assessment tools have been proven effective for predicting fall risk, the tests are most commonly performed in the clinical environment and at isolated times during an individual's day. The goal of this application is to develop and validate a novel wearable device (Automatic Longitudinal Assessment Risk Monitor - ALARM) for longitudinal assessment of risk of falling. Such a device: - will allow early detection of risk of falling, when therapeutic interventions are most efficient - will provide real-time feedback about activity pattern - will provide feedback about compliance with interventions and effectiveness of interventions - will be incorporated into conventional footwear and require no extra effort to operate - can be used in research, clinical and potentially in consumer applications The development of the ALARM system will be addressed in three specific aims:  Specific Aims 1: Develop a pattern recognition method that will improve recognition accuracy for activities of interest (such as walking and stepping up) by reducing the range of variation from current 76%- 100% to 9911%. Specific Aim 2: Collect data using the ALARM device on a group of elderly adults during clinical tests. Specific Aim 3: Develop algorithms for automatic assessment of risk of falling. In this Aim we will develop signal processing algorithms that automatically evaluate metrics indicative of the risk of falling in each activity of interest (e.g. duration of swing and stance phase during walking). Specific Aim 4: Validate the ALARM device in a double-blind unrestricted free living study. This set of Specific Aims will validate lead to creation of a unique wearable device capable of objective characterization of risk of falling.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This application aims at development of a novel wearable device (Automatic Longitudinal Assessment Risk Monitor - ALARM) for longitudinal assessment of risk of falling. In our previous research we have shown that major activities and posture allocations such as standing, sitting, walking, etc. can be recognized with high degree of accuracy (76%-100%) by a wearable device incorporated into conventional footwear. We also have shown that sensor signals captured by the wearable shoe device during activities such as walking are well- correlated with the risk of falling (with numerical estimates of risk obtained through signal processing being directly proportional to the normalized scores from the clinical tests).

"New Computational Methods for Data-driven Protein Structure Prediction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proteins play a central role in all biological processes. Akin to the complete sequencing of genomes, complete description of protein structures is a fundamental step towards understanding biological life, and is also highly relevant medically in the development of therapeutics and drugs. The broad, long-term goal of the project is to develop machine learning methods for data-driven protein structure prediction through two independent but complementary strategies: 1) much more accurate template-based modeling for proteins with remote homologs in the Protein Data Bank and 2) better template-free modeling method for proteins without detectable templates and for improving template-based models. The specific aims are: Aim 1) to greatly improve template-based modeling by 1a) improving protein sequence-template alignment using a regression-tree-based nonlinear scoring function, especially when good sequence profiles are unavailable; and 1b) improving fold recognition using a machine learning method to combine both residue-level and atom-level features; Aim 2) to improve protein conformation sampling in a continuous space and thus template-free modeling by three independent but complementary approaches: 2a) modeling nonlinear sequence- structure relationship using Conditional (Markov) Random Fields (CRF) models; 2b) simultaneously sampling secondary and tertiary structure; and 2c) learning structure information from template. The core of the project is to develop various CRF models for data-driven protein structure prediction, by learning protein sequence-structure relationship from existing sequence/structure databases. The product of this research includes a regression-tree-based CRF model for accurate protein alignment, especially for proteins without close homologs in the PDB or without very good sequence profiles; a SVM model for protein fold recognition; a few CRF models for efficient protein conformation sampling in a continuous space; and a complete protein structure prediction software package. Also, it will produce a web server publicly available for various academic and biomedical users.

"Clinical Image Retrieval: User needs assessment toolbox development & evaluation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Advances in digital imaging technologies have led to a substantial growth in the number of digital images being created and stored in hospitals, medical systems, and on the Internet in recent years. Effective medical image retrieval systems can play an important role in teaching, research, diagnosis and treatment. Images were historically retrieved using text-based methods. The quality of annotations associated with images can reduce the effectiveness of text-based image retrieval. Despite recent advances, purely content- based image retrieval techniques lag significantly behind their textual counterparts in their ability to capture the semantic essence of the user's query. Preliminary research suggests that a more promising approach is to adaptively combine these complementary techniques to suit the user and their information needs. However, for these approaches to succeed, the researcher needs to enhance her computational skills in addition to acquiring a comprehensive understanding of the relevant clinical domain. This Pathway to Independence (K99/R00) grant application describes a training and career development plan that will allow the candidate, an NLM postdoctoral fellow in Medical Informatics at Oregon Health & Science University to achieve these objectives. The training component will be carried out under the mentorship of Dr. W. Hersh with Dr. Gorman (user studies). Dr. Fuss (radiation medicine) and Dr. Erdogmus (machine learning) providing additional mentoring in their areas of expertise.       The long-term goal of this Pathway to Independence (K99/R00) project is to improve visual information retrieval by better understanding user needs and proposing adaptive methodologies for multimodal image retrieval that will close the semantic gap.

"Interactive, Self-programming, AI System for Activity Monitoring of the Elderly    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Elderly patients with dementia present a massive care challenge for family members and care professionals. In the last year of a patient's life, half of family caregivers report spending 46 or more hours a week assisting him/her with activities of daily living (ADL). More than half felt they were ""on duty"" 24 hours a day, and half had to end/reduce employment due to the demands of care-giving. Ingenium proposes to create a practical, self-learning, system for activity monitoring and support of elderly persons. This advanced activity monitoring combined with Ingenium's interactive communications and support system will extend independent living and the successful conduct of everyday tasks for the elderly, disabled, and soldiers with PTSD and TBI. The goal in this proposal is to produce a system that can reliably recognize activities using only one Ingenium wireless room-master per room and an Ingenium wearable wireless badge linked to an AI system with self-learning capability. This is accomplished through the interactive badge and room masters. In contrast, existing technology uses many sensors and requires off-line processing to train the activity recognizer and is not useable beyond laboratory environments. Additionally, no current commercial system has interactive planning and scheduling support. Ingenium will utilize the assistance of the AI lab staff at Washington State University which is an acknowledged leader in recognizing activities of daily living. Aim #1 will re-create the WSU technology, transfer activity knowledge to the Ingenium platform and enhance the platform with interactive self learning Aim #2 will outfit the WSU smart apartment with the Ingenium system. The smart apartment has a complex set of 37 sensors. The Ingenium system will both simplify and enhance the WSU configuration by utilizing only 7 Ingenium room-masters. Twenty students will participate in a study to verify that the Ingenium system provides superior activity location and recognition than the current wired multiple motion sensor system. Aim #3 will test the ability of the enhanced interactive prompting and learning capability of the Ingenium system to learn the same activities without the knowledge transfer hence validating a real time learning activity recognizer is possible in a commercializable system. One of goals of Ingenium's business plan is to commercialize this system. .      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Today, 60 million Americans - one in five - require assistance in their living arrangements and daily activities. These are primarily elderly individuals and persons with disabilities. By applying the latest monitoring and artificial intelligence technologies, the outcomes of this research would enable the Ingenium system to improve the quality of home and institutional health care, and at the same time, reduce the cost of providing that care. The marketplace for technology to assist the elderly will grow sharply from $2 billion today to more than $20 billion by 2020, according to new reports from Frost & Sullivan and Forester Research (Liz Boehm, Principal Analyst for Healthcare and Life Sciences) entitled ""Healthcare Unbound's Early Self-Pay Market"".           Today, 60 million Americans - one in five - require assistance in their living arrangements and daily activities.

"Coding of auditory space in the avian brain    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): All auditory information used for sound localization ascends through the brainstem auditory nuclei. We will use physiological and theoretical approaches to understand how multidimensional features of sound, relevant to sound localization, are processed and encoded in the avian auditory brainstem. A primary advantage of using barn owls for the exploration of auditory processing is the substantial body of behavioral, anatomical and neurophysiological work that has elucidated the mechanisms of sound localization. The main cues owls use to compute sound direction are the interaural level difference (ILD) and the interaural time difference (ITD). Unlike mammals, owls use ILD to determine the vertical coordinate of the sound source and ITD to determine the horizontal coordinate. Two independent brainstem pathways process ITD and ILD and converge in the midbrain, where a spatiotopic map of auditory space emerges. Activity of neurons in the map precedes, and stimulation evokes, a head-orienting response towards the sound source. Thus, in barn owls, the neural algorithm for sound localization can be viewed as a system in which two input variables (ITD and ILD) are processed in parallel in order to control two output variables (horizontal and vertical coordinates of head saccades). We have used theoretical models to describe the neural responses that encode spatial information in the owl's auditory system. This approach has guided our experiments and aided the interpretation of our findings. Behavioral experiments in humans have used a similar approach to sound localization. However, due to a lack of neural data in humans, the predictive power of models of sound localization with regard to the neural bases of behavior has been a persistent question. Our studies in barn owls address this issue by investigating the mechanism of neural computations that are fundamental to models developed for human sound localization. This proposal is organized around three primary questions: 1) What are the computational primitives of auditory-space processing in the owl's brainstem? 2) How is spectrotemporal information encoded, transmitted and processed in parallel with spatial information? 3) What fundamental changes in information coding occur at the crossroads between the auditory midbrain and forebrain? We will address these questions using a wide range of strategies and techniques - intracellular in vivo recordings, cell-attached recording in vivo, multi-neuron tetrode recording, and modeling - which will make our approach interdisciplinary and of broad scope. Our research seeks to understand the function of the auditory brainstem and midbrain. In doing so, we will identify the types of information that are available to upstream nuclei and show how this information is encoded. A comprehensive approach to information processing in the auditory brainstem has the potential to provide new avenues for better understanding disorders of the central auditory system and cognitive impairments involving hearing. By linking biology and engineering, mathematical formulations of brain processes can advance technology related to robotics and neural prosthetics. Cochlear implants that provide encoding of stimuli in ways that are more biologically relevant can be built, while devices acting downstream of the cochlea could aid patients with compromised or non-functional auditory nerves. By its differences and similarities with other species, the avian brain provides an excellent model system to define fundamental properties of neural processing and neural coding.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research will test hypotheses based on human models, of how the auditory system computes sound direction. This approach has the potential of providing new avenues for better understanding disorders of the central auditory system and cognitive impairments involving hearing. By linking biology and engineering, mathematical formulations of brain processes can advance technology related to artificial intelligence and neural prosthetics; smarter cochlear implants can be built, as well as devices acting downstream of the cochlea could aid patients with compromised or non-functional auditory nerves.

"A Wireless Multiscale Distributed Interface to the Cortex    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The development of advanced neuroprosthetic systems and brain-machine interfaces for high-capacity, real-time, bi-directional communication with the nervous system is a major challenge to the emerging neural engineering discipline.  While recent advances in the fabrication of high-density microelectrode arrays (HDMEAs) for multiunit recording and stimulation have triggered numerous neurobiological discoveries, the resulting large data throughput and the variability of cortical responses over repeated trials preclude the ability to design a wireless, adaptive, fully implantable large-scale interface to the cortex.  This severely limits the feasibility and space of experimental paradigms needed to improve our understanding of the nervous system functionality and characterize cortical responses in freely behaving subjects interacting naturally with their surroundings.  The objective of this project is to develop a wireless interface to the cortex capable of processing simultaneously recorded neural signalsfrom 64 electrode channels in real time.  The project has 3 aims:  1.  Develop advanced signal processing algorithms for sensing and decoding neuronal response properties from distributed intra-cortical neural activity:  1) Optimize our existing signal processing algorithms for hardware implementation to extract the desired neural activity early in the data stream; 2) Develop new algorithms for decoding these responses to characterize the natural behavior of awake, behaving animal models.  2.  Design low-power integrated circuits and wireless telemetry for a 64 channel system:  1) Optimize the design of a low power Neural Interface Node (NIN) module to feature wireless communication and powering capability for subcutaneous implantation; 2) Design and fabricate an extracranial Manager Interface Module (MIM) to permit:  a) wireless powering and data exchange with up to 2 implanted NIN modules; b) wireless bidirectional exchange of data and control with a central base station.  3.  Demonstrate the system functionality in vitro and vivo:  1) Build a 32 channel system and test its performance in vitro in retinal slices and in vivo in awake behaving rodents; 2) Demonstrate the real time functionality of a 64 channel system in vitro and explore its feasibility in vivo; 3) Optimize the entire system design, and benchmark it against a commercial 64 channel wired data acquisition system.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This project seeks to develop a wireless electronic microsystem to be implanted in the rat brain to continuously monitor neural signals when the rat is freely behaving in an open environment.

"SLASH: SCALABLE LARGE ANALYTIC SEGMENTATION HYBRID DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Advanced instrumentation and cellular imaging techniques using high-throughput 3D electron microscopy are driving a new revolution in the exploration of complex biological systems by providing near seamless views across multiple scales of resolution. These datasets provide the necessary breadth and depth to analyze multicellular, cellular, and subcelluar structure across large swathes of neural tissue. While these new imaging procedures are generating extremely large datasets of enormous value, the quantities are such that no single user or even laboratory team can possibly analyze the full content of their own imaging activities through traditional means. To address this challenge, we propose to further develop and refine a prototype hybrid system for high-throughput segmentation of large neuropil datasets that: 1) advances automatic algorithms for segmentation of cellular and sub-cellular structures using machine learning techniques; 2) couples these techniques to a scalable and flexible process or tool suite allowing multiple users to simultaneously review, edit and curate the results of these automatic approaches; and, 3) builds a knowledge base of training data guiding and improving automated processing. This system will allow project scientists to select areas of interest, execute automatic segmentation algorithms, and distribute workload, curate data, and deposit final results into the Cell Centered Database (Martone et al. 2008) via accessible web-interfaces. Emerging techniques in cellular and subcellular 3D imaging are generating datasets of enormous value to the study of disease processes and to the pursuit of greater insight into the structure and function of the nervous system. To unlock the potential of these data, new solutions are needed to improve the capability to segment and label the individual molecular, subcellular and cellular components within very large volumetric expanses.

"Low-Cost Electronic Nose for Groundwater Contaminants    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Several US agencies and regulators require low-cost chemical sensors for detecting and monitoring environmental clean-up, remediation, and decommissioning processes where groundwater may be contaminated. The sensors must be capable of detecting contaminants in the sub-surface groundwater and must be compatible with use in a range of environments. Most significantly, these customers require a low-cost alternative to its current expensive and labor intensive methods, namely using mobile laboratories. The project will result in the innovative use of low-cost sensor systems that will be capable of detecting and monitoring for dense non-aqueous phase liquids in the subsurface and groundwater, unattended, and in real- time from within a push-probe, using a chemicapacitor array and miniature preconcentrator.  The ultimate goal of this SBIR project is to provide the DOD, DOE, and other agencies with a method to map and track subsurface contamination plumes in real-time without requiring an operator. In Phase I, Seacoast successfully demonstrated the feasibility of using a microsensor array with a proprietary trap-and- purge preconcentrator to detect chlorinated solvents, specifically TCE, and TCA, at levels low enough to meet EPA mandated levels for drinking water. In Phase II Seacoast proposes to improve the selectivity and sensitivity of the system to better meet the needs identified by the Phase I consultant. The systems have MEMS microcapacitor sensor arrays that can monitor for leaks of toxic chemicals, contaminants from wastes, and changes in groundwater streams. A preconcentrator traps the contaminants and releases them to a microsensor array. These sensor arrays are filled with several chemoselective polymers whose dielectric permittivity changes when exposed to different vapors, creating a fingerprint response for each chemical.  In Phase II Seacoast will specifically develop new materials to improve the sensor array selectivity, 1) by using impedance spectroscopy to study the mechanisms by which the polymer-based sensors sorb the target chemicals, 2) by implementing pattern recognition algorithms to identify chemicals for the sensor responses, and 3) by designing new preconcentrator materials that can bind these chemicals more strongly.  The most important application to public health and safety is unattended monitoring of drinking water, water treatment processes, and water sources. Potential markets include building chemical process monitoring and control, toxic vapor leak detection, industrial process control, and industrial health and safety. Transitioning the developed prototype to other markets where worker and public health, environmental health and regulatory compliance will be investigated to reduce the financial risks and broaden the acceptance of the technology.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal describes a novel technology that specifically addresses the need for detecting groundwater contaminants and long-term monitoring of contaminated sites, by providing an unattended sensor system that tracks contamination in real-time and transmits contaminant concentrations.

"Ancillary Comparative Effectiveness of Atrial Fibrillation Ablation Surgery    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This proposal describes an ancillary study to a recently initiated comparative effectiveness trial ""Surgical Ablation versus No Surgical Ablation for Patients with Persistent or Longstanding Persistent Atrial Fibrillation Undergoing Mitral Valve Surgery"" (NCT00903370), which is part of the NHLBI-sponsored Cardiothoracic Surgery Network (CTSN). Its aims are to perform a time-sensitive substudy of continuous heart rhythm monitoring and to develop and apply novel statistical tools to assess ablation effectiveness in groups of patients. As such, it will provide critical new knowledge to support a secondary objective of the parent trial: to inform rhythm monitoring and analysis strategies for future trials of rhythm control in atrial fibrillation (AF).  Great enthusiasm for innovative tissue-destroying (ablation) procedures to treat AF has led to technology outstripping science. Mechanisms of AF (which afflicts >3 million Americans) remain poorly understood, methods to assess its cure are primitive, and guidelines for analyzing rhythm outcomes are flawed due to lack of appropriate statistical methodology. Why? After ablation procedures, AF may recur in episodes of varying duration. Yet current monitoring consists of ""snapshots"" of semiannual rhythm recording (Holter), or more frequent-but short-transtelephonic monitoring (TTM). Ideally, an implantable monitoring device could detect all these episodes over a patient's lifetime; however, even if this were possible, statistical methods to analyze this series of occurrences in groups of patients for comparative effectiveness of AF therapies or to identify risk factors are poorly developed. Right now a window of opportunity exists to make important strides in more thorough AF assessment and proper data analysis because the CTSN has just launched a randomized trial of surgical AF therapies that includes weekly TTM of atrial rhythm as well as traditional 6- and 12-month Holter assessment. We propose a time-sensitive substudy of implanting an FDA-approved miniature loop recorder to capture AF episodes continuously. These data will be used in the development of a suite of new analytic methods for aggregating data such as these across time and across patients to characterize time course and identify modulating factors. They will then be used to assess the trial's rhythm endpoints and suggest designs for more informative future trials with substantially reduced sample size. We have assembled a team of clinicians and statisticians, including individuals who designed the parent trial, who are experienced in implanting the monitoring device, and who are experts in analytic methods research, to develop and apply novel methods to these several types of rhythm data. We will leverage developments from an intramural NHLBI machine learning program at Cleveland Clinic and State of Ohio-funded Atrial Fibrillation Innovation Center. The analytic methods have wide applicability to the important field of longitudinal data analysis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  A chaotic heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation (AF), which affects more than 3 million Americans, especially the elderly, causes strokes, and commonly accompanies heart valve disease. AF treatments outstrip scientific understanding of the rhythm and how to assess treatment success across time in clinical trials. Thus, the Institute of Medicine has placed trials of AF treatment in the first tier of 100 comparative effectiveness priorities for the nation. An NIH-sponsored trial of surgical treatment of AF is has just been launched, and we propose a substudy of an implanted rhythm monitoring device (Medtronic REVEAL XT) and new methods of AF analysis for groups of patients that will help assess the trial's endpoints and inform future trials. Thus, this ancillary study application proposes to (1) collect, in a subset of patients, more refined rhythm data than proposed in the parent trial, (2) develop generalizable new methods of analysis, and (3) apply these methods to both the data collected through continuous monitoring as well as the follow-up data collected in the parent trial through Holter and trans-telephonic monitoring.

"Longitudinal Assessment of Fall Risk    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Falling is not a normal part of the aging process and yet 1/3 to 1/2 of adults 65 years and older sustain at least one fall annually. Older adults are hospitalized for fall related injuries five times more often than from injuries from other causes contributing to a cost of $19 billion for nonfatal falls in the United States. Projected for the increasing aging population in the year 2020, it is expected that the costs related to falls will reach a staggering 54.9 billion dollars. Current research and clinical practice guidelines focus on multifactorial fall risk assessments as the critical deterrent to falls in the elderly. A primary factor within these assessments is activity of daily living performance of the individual elder. While current standardized clinical balance assessment tools have been proven effective for predicting fall risk, the tests are most commonly performed in the clinical environment and at isolated times during an individual's day. The goal of this application is to develop and validate a novel wearable device (Automatic Longitudinal Assessment Risk Monitor - ALARM) for longitudinal assessment of risk of falling. Such a device: - will allow early detection of risk of falling, when therapeutic interventions are most efficient - will provide real-time feedback about activity pattern - will provide feedback about compliance with interventions and effectiveness of interventions - will be incorporated into conventional footwear and require no extra effort to operate - can be used in research, clinical and potentially in consumer applications The development of the ALARM system will be addressed in three specific aims:  Specific Aims 1: Develop a pattern recognition method that will improve recognition accuracy for activities of interest (such as walking and stepping up) by reducing the range of variation from current 76%- 100% to 9911%. Specific Aim 2: Collect data using the ALARM device on a group of elderly adults during clinical tests. Specific Aim 3: Develop algorithms for automatic assessment of risk of falling. In this Aim we will develop signal processing algorithms that automatically evaluate metrics indicative of the risk of falling in each activity of interest (e.g. duration of swing and stance phase during walking). Specific Aim 4: Validate the ALARM device in a double-blind unrestricted free living study. This set of Specific Aims will validate lead to creation of a unique wearable device capable of objective characterization of risk of falling.        This application aims at development of a novel wearable device (Automatic Longitudinal Assessment Risk Monitor - ALARM) for longitudinal assessment of risk of falling. In our previous research we have shown that major activities and posture allocations such as standing, sitting, walking, etc. can be recognized with high degree of accuracy (76%-100%) by a wearable device incorporated into conventional footwear. We also have shown that sensor signals captured by the wearable shoe device during activities such as walking are well- correlated with the risk of falling (with numerical estimates of risk obtained through signal processing being directly proportional to the normalized scores from the clinical tests). The goal of this application is to develop and validate a novel wearable device (ALARM) for longitudinal assessment of risk of falling.

"Continued development of CellProfiler cell image analysis software    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        Most laboratories studying biological processes and human disease use light/fluorescence microscopes to image cells and other biological samples. There is strong and growing demand for software to analyze these images, as automated microscopes collect images faster than can be examined by eye and the information sought from images is increasingly quantitative and complex.  We have begun to address this demand with CellProfiler, a versatile, open-source software tool for quantifying data from biological images, particularly in high-throughput experiments (www.cellprofiler.org). CellProfiler can extract valuable biological information from images quickly while increasing the objectivity and statistical power of assays. In the three years since its release, it has become widely used, having been downloaded more than 8,000 times by users in over 60 countries. Using CellProfiler's point-and-click interface, researchers build a customized chain of image analysis modules to identify and measure biological objects in images. The software evolved in an intensely collaborative and interdisciplinary research environment with dozens of ongoing projects and has been successfully applied to a wide range of biological samples and assays, from counting cells to scoring complex phenotypes by machine learning.  To enable further biological imaging research, meet the needs of the growing user base, and expand the community that benefits from CellProfiler, we propose to improve its capabilities, interface, and support:  First, we will add user-requested capabilities, leveraging existing open-source projects by interoperating with them where feasible. These new features will include object tracking in time-lapse movies, compatibility with additional file formats, new image processing algorithms, and expanded tools for quality control, performance evaluation, cluster computing, and workflow management.  Second, we will improve the interface, increase processing speed, and simplify the addition of new features by refactoring and porting the MATLAB-based code to an open-source language and instituting proven software development practices.  Third, we will provide user, educator, and developer support and outreach for CellProfiler. These activities will facilitate research in the scientific community and help guide usability improvements.  These improvements to the only open-source software for modular, high-throughput biological image analysis will enable hundreds of NIH-funded laboratories to make high-impact biological discoveries from cell images across all disciplines within biology.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:           Most laboratories studying biological processes and human disease use microscopy to analyze cells and  other samples. We will enable these researchers to rapidly and accurately extract numerical data from  microscopy images by continuing to develop and support our user-friendly, open-source cell image  analysis software, CellProfiler (www.cellprofiler.org).",Continued development of CellProfiler cell image analysis software,8274831,R01GM089652,"['Cell Number ', ' Cell Count ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Biology ', ' Cells ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Algorithms ', ' Environment ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye ', ' Email ', ' E-Mail ', ' Electronic Mail ', ' Grant ', ' Communities ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Paper ', ' Microscopy ', ' Manuals ', ' Laboratories ', ' Language ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Institutes ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Software Tools ', ' Stains ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research ', ' Persons ', ' Quality Control ', ' Reading ', ' Phenotype ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Biological ', ' Process Measure ', ' Measures ', ' image processing ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Microscope ', ' Time ', ' Testing ', ' Dependence ', ' Complex ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' meetings ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' tool ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Funding ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Image Analysis ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Discipline ', ' Evaluation ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Measurement ', ' outreach ', ' Sampling ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Laboratory Study ', ' Modeling ', ' repository ', ' developing computer software ', ' develop software ', ' software development ', ' laboratory fluorescence light microscope ', ' fluorescent microscope ', ' fluorescence/UV microscope ', ' Ultraviolet Microscopes ', ' UV laboratory microscope ', ' fluorescence microscope ', ' movie ', ' Speed ', ' Speed (motion) ', ' resource guides ', ' Performance ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' processing speed ', ' Country ', ' Stainings ', ' Staining method ', ' cell imaging ', ' cellular imaging ', ' grid computing ', ' distributed computing ', ' datagrid ', ' data grid ', ' computational grid ', ' cluster computing ', ' Whole Organism ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Data ', ' Address ', ' usability ', ' user-friendly ', ' web interface ', ' open source ', ' interoperability ', ' human disease ', ' file format ', ' ']",NIGMS,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",R01,2012,503268,MA-07,0.025239184008395133
"Ancillary Comparative Effectiveness of Atrial Fibrillation Ablation Surgery    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This proposal describes an ancillary study to a recently initiated comparative effectiveness trial ""Surgical Ablation versus No Surgical Ablation for Patients with Persistent or Longstanding Persistent Atrial Fibrillation Undergoing Mitral Valve Surgery"" (NCT00903370), which is part of the NHLBI-sponsored Cardiothoracic Surgery Network (CTSN). Its aims are to perform a time-sensitive substudy of continuous heart rhythm monitoring and to develop and apply novel statistical tools to assess ablation effectiveness in groups of patients. As such, it will provide critical new knowledge to support a secondary objective of the parent trial: to inform rhythm monitoring and analysis strategies for future trials of rhythm control in atrial fibrillation (AF).  Great enthusiasm for innovative tissue-destroying (ablation) procedures to treat AF has led to technology outstripping science. Mechanisms of AF (which afflicts >3 million Americans) remain poorly understood, methods to assess its cure are primitive, and guidelines for analyzing rhythm outcomes are flawed due to lack of appropriate statistical methodology. Why? After ablation procedures, AF may recur in episodes of varying duration. Yet current monitoring consists of ""snapshots"" of semiannual rhythm recording (Holter), or more frequent-but short-transtelephonic monitoring (TTM). Ideally, an implantable monitoring device could detect all these episodes over a patient's lifetime; however, even if this were possible, statistical methods to analyze this series of occurrences in groups of patients for comparative effectiveness of AF therapies or to identify risk factors are poorly developed. Right now a window of opportunity exists to make important strides in more thorough AF assessment and proper data analysis because the CTSN has just launched a randomized trial of surgical AF therapies that includes weekly TTM of atrial rhythm as well as traditional 6- and 12-month Holter assessment. We propose a time-sensitive substudy of implanting an FDA-approved miniature loop recorder to capture AF episodes continuously. These data will be used in the development of a suite of new analytic methods for aggregating data such as these across time and across patients to characterize time course and identify modulating factors. They will then be used to assess the trial's rhythm endpoints and suggest designs for more informative future trials with substantially reduced sample size. We have assembled a team of clinicians and statisticians, including individuals who designed the parent trial, who are experienced in implanting the monitoring device, and who are experts in analytic methods research, to develop and apply novel methods to these several types of rhythm data. We will leverage developments from an intramural NHLBI machine learning program at Cleveland Clinic and State of Ohio-funded Atrial Fibrillation Innovation Center. The analytic methods have wide applicability to the important field of longitudinal data analysis.    A chaotic heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation (AF), which affects more than 3 million Americans, especially the elderly, causes strokes, and commonly accompanies heart valve disease. AF treatments outstrip scientific understanding of the rhythm and how to assess treatment success across time in clinical trials. Thus, the Institute of Medicine has placed trials of AF treatment in the first tier of 100 comparative effectiveness priorities for the nation. An NIH-sponsored trial of surgical treatment of AF is has just been launched, and we propose a substudy of an implanted rhythm monitoring device (Medtronic REVEAL XT) and new methods of AF analysis for groups of patients that will help assess the trial's endpoints and inform future trials. Thus, this ancillary study application proposes to (1) collect, in a subset of patients, more refined rhythm data than proposed in the parent trial, (2) develop generalizable new methods of analysis, and (3) apply these methods to both the data collected through continuous monitoring as well as the follow-up data collected in the parent trial through Holter and trans-telephonic monitoring.

"Noninvasive Assessment of Neuromuscular Disease using Electrical Impedance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The neuromuscular disorders include a wide group of conditions ranging from relatively mild focal problems, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, to severe, generalized diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Current methods for evaluating these disorders remain limited to a variety of tests and procedures that are either invasive or remarkably qualitative in nature. One newer technique, electrical impedance myography (EIM), offers the prospect of obtaining quantitative data on muscle condition painlessly and non-invasively. However, no commercial devices specifically tailored for EIM use exist, with nearly all previous EIM work relying upon off-the-shelf bioimpedance devices designed for ""whole-body"" rather than single-muscle assessment. In Phase 1 of this SBIR, Convergence Medical Devices, Inc (CMD) developed an initial prototype system to test proof-of-principle innovative concepts in circuit design and data acquisition to provide highly sensitive and accurate data at an extended frequency range (out to 10 MHz) and over multiple angles relative to the major muscle fiber direction. This work was followed by supplemental work that produced the first hand-held device with robust electronics capable of similar measurements with a detachable, interchangeable electrode array. In this 3-year Phase 2 SBIR, CMD proposes to further refine that technology so as to assist in disease diagnosis and for following disease progression, with a specific focus on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In Aim 1 of the proposed grant, testing of multiple electrode array designs will be performed on a group of normal subjects and those with ALS to determine which electrode array designs offer the greatest reproducibility and ability to discriminate healthy from diseased individuals. In Aim 2, the device and the 3 ""best"" array designs identified in Aim 1 will be tested in 30 ALS patients, 30 patients with syndromes mimicking ALS (e.g., polyradiculopathy and motor-predominant neuropathy), and 30 subjects with suspected/possible ALS to determine the single best array design for diagnosis and to determine its sensitivity and specificity. This study will take place at CMD and four external sites and will be managed by the Northeast ALS trials Consortium (NEALS), the premier organization for overseeing clinical trials in ALS. In Aim 3, the 30 suspected/possible ALS patients recruited in SA2 and 30 additional suspected/possible ALS patients will be assessed monthly using EIM and the 3 arrays identified in SA1. All subjects will also undergo standard measurements of disease progression including handheld dynamometry, ALS Functional Rating Scale, and spirometry. The best array design for assessing disease progression will be identified and compared to conventional markers of disease progression to determine EIM's sensitivity to disease status. Thus, at the conclusion of this research program, we anticipate having developed and vigorously tested an EIM device and associated electrode designs that together will serve as a powerful new diagnostic and monitoring tool for neuromuscular disease.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The neuromuscular disorders are a group of conditions that impact the lives of millions of people in the United States alone. In this study, Convergence Medical Devices, in collaboration with neurologists at several medical centers, will develop and test a new device based on the concept of electrical impedance myography, a technique that offers the promise of rapid and accurate disease assessment. With the completion of this study, a new, painless tool will be developed and studied that will assist in individual patient care and will speed drug testing in clinical trials in diseases ranging from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and muscular dystrophy to radiculopathy and polyneuropathy.              The neuromuscular disorders are a group of conditions that impact the lives of millions of people in the United States alone.

"Context-Sensitive Search of Human Expression Compendia    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gene expression experiments are an abundant and robust source of functional genomics data, with thousands of microarray and a growing number of high throughput RNA sequencing studies publicly available, most interrogating clinical and biological systems relevant to disease. They hold the promise of data-driven characterization of gene function and regulation, including in specific tissues, cell lines, and disease states, and can advance the understanding and modeling of regulatory changes that form the basis of human disease. However, these data remain largely underutilized, as biology researchers do not have effective tools to explore and analyze the entire data collection to generate novel hypotheses and direct experiments. The situation is similar to that of the Internet before the search engines - a biology researcher has to know a priori which datasets pertain to the biological question she is asking, reflect the tissue/cell-lineage specific signals of interest to her, and accurately measure the expression of genes related to her pathways of interest. There is a clear need for methods that will enable biology researchers to use their domain-specific knowledge to direct their exploration of public human expression data, enabling them to generate hypotheses and direct experiments addressing challenging biomedical questions. Such a system should provide users with ability to effectively explore automatically identified datasets relevant to their biological question of interest, leverage metazoan complexity including cell lineage and disease specific signals, and allow the researcher to securely include their unpublished data in the analysis. To address these challenges, this proposal describes a ""Google-style"" public search engine for large collections of gene expression data built using novel search algorithms and leveraging cloud-computing technologies. This system implements a novel query-based context-sensitive algorithm for search of large expression compendia that exploits the complexity of metazoan organisms, including cell-lineage complexity and disease aspects inherent to human expression studies. Furthermore, the challenge of heterogeneity in human samples will be addressed by developing novel hierarchical learning methods to predict cell-lineage or tissue-specific gene expression based on the compendium and to identify these signals in each dataset. This will enable users to explore tissue-specific expression and also will be integrated with the search algorithm to improve search accuracy. Proposed algorithms, search engine, and user interface will be extensively evaluated in close collaboration with biology researchers, and top predictions will be tested experimentally. These methods will be implemented in a user-friendly public search system that will leverage cloud computing to provide robust interactive query response and will enable biology researchers to explore both published data collections and their own pre-publication datasets in a context-specific, integrated, and secure manner.        We will develop a ""Google-style"" search engine for massive collections of human gene expression data.

"Passive Activity Monitoring with Patient Identification and Gesture Detection     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Elderly patients with Alzheimer's disease and dementia present a massive care challenge for family members and care professionals. In the last year of a patient's life, half of family caregivers report spending 46 or more hours a week assisting him/her with activities of daily living (ADL). Ingenium Care proposes to create a passive, self-learning, system for activity monitoring and support of elderly persons using the novel technology of Microsoft's Kinect device. This advanced activity monitoring combined with Ingenium Care's interactive communications and support system will extend independent living and the successful conduct of everyday tasks for the elderly with Alzheimer's disease, dementia, people with disabilities, and soldiers with PTSD and TBI. Existing monitoring technology has limited activity recognition capability or uses many sensors and wearable devices. The need for wearable devices requires cooperation from the elderly that may not reminder or resent to wear it. We propose to replace our existing wearable badge technology with a passive device based on the Kinect device from Microsoft. A network of these sensors provides precise location information within a home or facility and detects falls and gestures such as eating, drinking or taking medications. This device will eliminate the need to wear any device. Aim #1 - Goal: Develop Algorithms for Proof of Concept Gesture Recognition. Aim #2 - Goal: Do laboratory training and testing of detection algorithms utilizing a single work station. Aim #3 - Goal: Perform randomized activities and gestures in a simulated living environment and iteratively improve algorithms.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Narrative Today, 60 million Americans - one in five - require assistance in their living arrangements and daily activities.

"Coding of auditory space in the avian brain    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): All auditory information used for sound localization ascends through the brainstem auditory nuclei. We will use physiological and theoretical approaches to understand how multidimensional features of sound, relevant to sound localization, are processed and encoded in the avian auditory brainstem. A primary advantage of using barn owls for the exploration of auditory processing is the substantial body of behavioral, anatomical and neurophysiological work that has elucidated the mechanisms of sound localization. The main cues owls use to compute sound direction are the interaural level difference (ILD) and the interaural time difference (ITD). Unlike mammals, owls use ILD to determine the vertical coordinate of the sound source and ITD to determine the horizontal coordinate. Two independent brainstem pathways process ITD and ILD and converge in the midbrain, where a spatiotopic map of auditory space emerges. Activity of neurons in the map precedes, and stimulation evokes, a head-orienting response towards the sound source. Thus, in barn owls, the neural algorithm for sound localization can be viewed as a system in which two input variables (ITD and ILD) are processed in parallel in order to control two output variables (horizontal and vertical coordinates of head saccades). We have used theoretical models to describe the neural responses that encode spatial information in the owl's auditory system. This approach has guided our experiments and aided the interpretation of our findings. Behavioral experiments in humans have used a similar approach to sound localization. However, due to a lack of neural data in humans, the predictive power of models of sound localization with regard to the neural bases of behavior has been a persistent question. Our studies in barn owls address this issue by investigating the mechanism of neural computations that are fundamental to models developed for human sound localization. This proposal is organized around three primary questions: 1) What are the computational primitives of auditory-space processing in the owl's brainstem? 2) How is spectrotemporal information encoded, transmitted and processed in parallel with spatial information? 3) What fundamental changes in information coding occur at the crossroads between the auditory midbrain and forebrain? We will address these questions using a wide range of strategies and techniques - intracellular in vivo recordings, cell-attached recording in vivo, multi-neuron tetrode recording, and modeling - which will make our approach interdisciplinary and of broad scope. Our research seeks to understand the function of the auditory brainstem and midbrain. In doing so, we will identify the types of information that are available to upstream nuclei and show how this information is encoded. A comprehensive approach to information processing in the auditory brainstem has the potential to provide new avenues for better understanding disorders of the central auditory system and cognitive impairments involving hearing. By linking biology and engineering, mathematical formulations of brain processes can advance technology related to robotics and neural prosthetics. Cochlear implants that provide encoding of stimuli in ways that are more biologically relevant can be built, while devices acting downstream of the cochlea could aid patients with compromised or non-functional auditory nerves. By its differences and similarities with other species, the avian brain provides an excellent model system to define fundamental properties of neural processing and neural coding.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research will test hypotheses based on human models, of how the auditory system computes sound direction. This approach has the potential of providing new avenues for better understanding disorders of the central auditory system and cognitive impairments involving hearing. By linking biology and engineering, mathematical formulations of brain processes can advance technology related to artificial intelligence and neural prosthetics; smarter cochlear implants can be built, as well as devices acting downstream of the cochlea could aid patients with compromised or non-functional auditory nerves.

"New Computational Methods for Data-driven Protein Structure Prediction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proteins play a central role in all biological processes. Akin to the complete sequencing of genomes, complete description of protein structures is a fundamental step towards understanding biological life, and is also highly relevant medically in the development of therapeutics and drugs. The broad, long-term goal of the project is to develop machine learning methods for data-driven protein structure prediction through two independent but complementary strategies: 1) much more accurate template-based modeling for proteins with remote homologs in the Protein Data Bank and 2) better template-free modeling method for proteins without detectable templates and for improving template-based models. The specific aims are: Aim 1) to greatly improve template-based modeling by 1a) improving protein sequence-template alignment using a regression-tree-based nonlinear scoring function, especially when good sequence profiles are unavailable; and 1b) improving fold recognition using a machine learning method to combine both residue-level and atom-level features; Aim 2) to improve protein conformation sampling in a continuous space and thus template-free modeling by three independent but complementary approaches: 2a) modeling nonlinear sequence- structure relationship using Conditional (Markov) Random Fields (CRF) models; 2b) simultaneously sampling secondary and tertiary structure; and 2c) learning structure information from template. The core of the project is to develop various CRF models for data-driven protein structure prediction, by learning protein sequence-structure relationship from existing sequence/structure databases. The product of this research includes a regression-tree-based CRF model for accurate protein alignment, especially for proteins without close homologs in the PDB or without very good sequence profiles; a SVM model for protein fold recognition; a few CRF models for efficient protein conformation sampling in a continuous space; and a complete protein structure prediction software package. Also, it will produce a web server publicly available for various academic and biomedical users. Protein structure prediction will lead to a broad range of biomedical applications, such as the development of novel diagnostics, better understanding of disease processes and improved preventive therapies leading to reduced health care costs.

"Sensor Activity Monitoring, Feedback, and Outcome Measures, Stroke Rehabilitation     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ""Technologies for Healthy Independent Living"" coincides with our goal to test and further develop inexpensive wireless sensors with communication and analysis platforms to monitor everyday activities, such as walking and exercise, in disabled persons. Our Medical Daily Activity Wireless Network (MDAWN) aims to enable researchers, trialists, and clinicians to acquire reliable data about daily physical activites in the home and community, rather than only during clinic and laboratory visits or by questionnaires. Novel machine-learning algorithms developed for each person from ankle accelerometers will identify the type, quantity and quality of exercise and walking on a continuous basis. In addition, we will test an inexpensive, instrumented, ergometric pedaler designed for disabled persons, called the UCFit, to promote home-based fitness exercise. The MDAWN and UFCFit sensors send data to an Android smartphone, then over the Internet to a UCLA server for analysis. We will nest further evaluation of the utility of these remote sensing devices within the real-world setting of a clinical trial of patients with recent disabling stroke,for whom formal rehabilitation often falls short of enabling functional walking and cardiovascular fitness. In a phase 2, randomized controlled trial, we will compare two levels of weekly telephonic feedback about daily performance, made possible for the first time by remote data acquisition. The high feedback group will receive everyday performance data that includes the number of bouts and minutes of pedaling plus rate/RPMs and forces used, as well as the number of bouts of walking, duration, and average speed and distance used in home and community. The minimal feedback group only hears about total daily UCFit exercise and walking time. After 4 months of encouraging up to four 30-min sessions per week of UCFit exercise, we will test for a 50% between-group difference in amount of daily exercise and walking time. Secondary outcomes examine change in level of fitness, walking speed, and physical functioning. The two groups then cross over to high or low feedback for 4 more months, before outcomes are reassessed. Then, no feedback is given and participants are tested for amount of exercise and fitness at 12 months. We will determine which form of feedback motivates better self-management to optimize fitness and walking. We will gather unique data about mobility in the transition from rehabilitation hospital to home; quantify gait training durin usual care; assess walking skills under more complex conditions than in a laboratory; and test the responsiveness of sensor data as a ratio scale outcome measurement during a time of expected gains. This study will be the first comprehensive demonstration of mHealth remote monitoring and outcome measures of daily physical activity!        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Several important public health needs will be met by testing, within a clinical trial in the home and community, a system of wearable activity and exercise monitoring technologies that measure the type, quantity and quality of walking and exercise. Our trial aims to increase fitness and enable more functional levels of daily activities in disable persons after stroke, while providing a proof-of-principle for the utility of wireless health toolsto reliably monitor real-world physical functioning and to provide clinically meaningful outcome measures.

"Clinical Image Retrieval: User needs assessment toolbox development & evaluation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Advances in digital imaging technologies have led to a substantial growth in the number of digital images being created and stored in hospitals, medical systems, and on the Internet in recent years. Effective medical image retrieval systems can play an important role in teaching, research, diagnosis and treatment. Images were historically retrieved using text-based methods. The quality of annotations associated with images can reduce the effectiveness of text-based image retrieval. Despite recent advances, purely content- based image retrieval techniques lag significantly behind their textual counterparts in their ability to capture the semantic essence of the user's query. Preliminary research suggests that a more promising approach is to adaptively combine these complementary techniques to suit the user and their information needs. However, for these approaches to succeed, the researcher needs to enhance her computational skills in addition to acquiring a comprehensive understanding of the relevant clinical domain. This Pathway to Independence (K99/R00) grant application describes a training and career development plan that will allow the candidate, an NLM postdoctoral fellow in Medical Informatics at Oregon Health & Science University to achieve these objectives. The training component will be carried out under the mentorship of Dr. W. Hersh with Dr. Gorman (user studies). Dr. Fuss (radiation medicine) and Dr. Erdogmus (machine learning) providing additional mentoring in their areas of expertise.

"SLASH: SCALABLE LARGE ANALYTIC SEGMENTATION HYBRID DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Advanced instrumentation and cellular imaging techniques using high-throughput 3D electron microscopy are driving a new revolution in the exploration of complex biological systems by providing near seamless views across multiple scales of resolution. These datasets provide the necessary breadth and depth to analyze multicellular, cellular, and subcelluar structure across large swathes of neural tissue. While these new imaging procedures are generating extremely large datasets of enormous value, the quantities are such that no single user or even laboratory team can possibly analyze the full content of their own imaging activities through traditional means. To address this challenge, we propose to further develop and refine a prototype hybrid system for high-throughput segmentation of large neuropil datasets that: 1) advances automatic algorithms for segmentation of cellular and sub-cellular structures using machine learning techniques; 2) couples these techniques to a scalable and flexible process or tool suite allowing multiple users to simultaneously review, edit and curate the results of these automatic approaches; and, 3) builds a knowledge base of training data guiding and improving automated processing. This system will allow project scientists to select areas of interest, execute automatic segmentation algorithms, and distribute workload, curate data, and deposit final results into the Cell Centered Database (Martone et al. 2008) via accessible web-interfaces. Emerging techniques in cellular and subcellular 3D imaging are generating datasets of enormous value to the study of disease processes and to the pursuit of greater insight into the structure and function of the nervous system. To unlock the potential of these data, new solutions are needed to improve the capability to segment and label the individual molecular, subcellular and cellular components within very large volumetric expanses. To address this challenge, we propose a hybrid system for high-throughput segmentation of large neuropil datasets that advances machine learning algorithms for automatic segmentation and couples these techniques to a scalable tool suite for multiple users to simultaneously review, edit and curate results.",SLASH: SCALABLE LARGE ANALYTIC SEGMENTATION HYBRID,8259135,R01NS075314,"['Adoption ', ' Algorithms ', ' driving ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' plasmalemma ', ' Plasma Membrane ', ' Cytoplasmic Membrane ', ' Cell membrane ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cells ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Computers ', ' Couples ', ' intracellular skeleton ', ' Cytoskeletal System ', ' Cellular Matrix ', ' Cytoskeleton ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Negatrons ', ' Negative Beta Particle ', ' Electrons ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Hybrids ', ' Institutes ', ' Laboratories ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Electron Microscopy ', ' Microscopy, Electron, Scanning ', ' mitochondrial ', ' Mitochondria ', ' Names ', ' Neurologic Organ System ', ' Neurologic Body System ', ' Nervous System ', ' Nervous system structure ', ' nervous system function ', ' Neurological function ', ' Neurologic function ', ' Nervous System Physiology ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' Organelles ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Solutions ', ' Stains ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' tomography ', ' Universities ', ' Utah ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Work Load ', ' Workload ', ' tangle ', ' neurofibrillary pathology ', ' neurofibrillary lesion ', ' neurofibrillary degeneration ', ' Neurofibrillary Tangles ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' image processing ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Microscopic ', ' Biological ', ' Training ', ' Neuropil ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Cell Structure ', ' Cell Components ', ' Cellular Structures ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' Deposit ', ' Deposition ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Stainings ', ' Staining method ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' computer imaging ', ' digital imaging ', ' electron optics ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Devices ', ' Intracellular Structure ', ' Subcellular structure ', ' Three Dimensional Medical Imaging ', ' 3D imaging ', ' 3-D Imaging ', ' Three-Dimensional Imaging ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Target ', ' Resolution ', ' Computer Instrumentation ', ' Advanced Instrumentation ', ' Computers and Advanced Instrumentation ', ' Validation ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' cell imaging ', ' cellular imaging ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' web interface ', ' scientific computing ', ' prototype ', ' public health relevance ', ' biological systems ', ' complex biological systems ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' ']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2012,445075,CA-52,0.018230483238334157
"Low-Cost Electronic Nose for Groundwater Contaminants    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Several US agencies and regulators require low-cost chemical sensors for detecting and monitoring environmental clean-up, remediation, and decommissioning processes where groundwater may be contaminated. The sensors must be capable of detecting contaminants in the sub-surface groundwater and must be compatible with use in a range of environments. Most significantly, these customers require a low-cost alternative to its current expensive and labor intensive methods, namely using mobile laboratories. The project will result in the innovative use of low-cost sensor systems that will be capable of detecting and monitoring for dense non-aqueous phase liquids in the subsurface and groundwater, unattended, and in real- time from within a push-probe, using a chemicapacitor array and miniature preconcentrator.  The ultimate goal of this SBIR project is to provide the DOD, DOE, and other agencies with a method to map and track subsurface contamination plumes in real-time without requiring an operator. In Phase I, Seacoast successfully demonstrated the feasibility of using a microsensor array with a proprietary trap-and- purge preconcentrator to detect chlorinated solvents, specifically TCE, and TCA, at levels low enough to meet EPA mandated levels for drinking water. In Phase II Seacoast proposes to improve the selectivity and sensitivity of the system to better meet the needs identified by the Phase I consultant. The systems have MEMS microcapacitor sensor arrays that can monitor for leaks of toxic chemicals, contaminants from wastes, and changes in groundwater streams. A preconcentrator traps the contaminants and releases them to a microsensor array. These sensor arrays are filled with several chemoselective polymers whose dielectric permittivity changes when exposed to different vapors, creating a fingerprint response for each chemical.  In Phase II Seacoast will specifically develop new materials to improve the sensor array selectivity, 1) by using impedance spectroscopy to study the mechanisms by which the polymer-based sensors sorb the target chemicals, 2) by implementing pattern recognition algorithms to identify chemicals for the sensor responses, and 3) by designing new preconcentrator materials that can bind these chemicals more strongly.  The most important application to public health and safety is unattended monitoring of drinking water, water treatment processes, and water sources. Potential markets include building chemical process monitoring and control, toxic vapor leak detection, industrial process control, and industrial health and safety. Transitioning the developed prototype to other markets where worker and public health, environmental health and regulatory compliance will be investigated to reduce the financial risks and broaden the acceptance of the technology.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal describes a novel technology that specifically addresses the need for detecting groundwater contaminants and long-term monitoring of contaminated sites, by providing an unattended sensor system that tracks contamination in real-time and transmits contaminant concentrations. Such a system would be used in tandem with other methods, to provide comprehensive contamination management at DOE, DOD, and Superfund sites where ground and water clean-up projects are already underway. The proposed work will focus on detection of chlorinated hydrocarbons, which are described as among the most common pollutants in groundwater and soils at DOE sites.

"Real-Time Automated Detection of Craving States with fMRI and EEG  Project Summary/Abstract Neurofeedback by real time functional MRI (rt-fMRI) has potential for addiction research and treatment that will be realized only if the feedback given the subject is related meaningfully to the cognitive states that must be controlled. The mental operations of the brain are too distributed to be represented by the raw rt-fMRI signal in any one brain region or small group of regions. Our aims are to: 1) Use computational machine learning to rapidly detect patterned activation in the rt-fMRI signal that better expresses cognitive state; 2) augment these data with concurrently-collected electroencephalographic (EEG) data; 3) develop an atlas of brain data that identifies brain patterns with cognitive states relevant to addiction and drug abuse research and 4) to explore rt-fMRI neurofeedback using this rt-fMRI/EEG machine learning method. Our approach will be to first create rapid algorithms for pattern matching that are fast compared with the imaging, thereby allowing ""real-time"" application. To do so we will select features from the images that express the differences among state concisely (more technically, we will use a method known as independent components analysis to reduce the data dimensionality.) We will similarly condense the EEG features by studying them by the location of their sources within the brain, and by examining the frequencies that they contain. We will run experiments on volunteers designed to help us see their tendency to make impulsive choices - which is known to relate to their likelihood to become drug users, as well as experiments that track changes in their brain as they control their craving urges. For these studies we will look at heavy cigarette users. Cigarette use on its own is a serious health burden to the nation, and it is also an excellent model for addiction more generally, as it is known to have many neural features in common with use of other drugs of abuse, such as cocaine and methamphetamine. This is a phased innovation proposal. The first phase will be focused on the developments of the rt-fMRI analysis and instrumentation technology. On its successful completion, based on specific milestones, we will move to the more applied work with human subjects.  Project Narrative Our research aims to develop and characterize a means of rapidly detecting brain states relevant to addiction research through the use of magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography. We are interested specifically in states and markers of impulsivity and cigarette craving. Our goal ultimately is to have a tool that can be used in the context of neurofeedback, allowing human subject or patient to receive an indication of activity in their brains associated with these states and to enable them to learn to control these cognitive/affective states by controlling the brain activity.",Real-Time Automated Detection of Craving States with fMRI and

"A Study of Social Web Data on Buprenorphine Abuse Using Semantic Web Technology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The non-medical use of pharmaceutical opioids has been identified as one of the fastest growing forms of drug abuse in the U.S. There is a critical need to enhance current epidemiological monitoring, early warning, and post-marketing surveillance systems by providing additional and more timely data. The World Wide Web has been identified as one of the ""leading edge"" data sources for detecting patterns and changes in drug use practices. Many websites provide a venue for individuals to freely share their own experiences, post questions, and offer comments about different drugs. Such User Generated Content (UGC) can be used as a very rich data source to study knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to illicit drugs. To harness the full potential of the Web for drug abuse research, the field needs to develop a highly automated way of accessing, extracting, and analyzing Web-based data related to illicit drug use. This exploratory R21 is a multi-principal investigator, collaborative effort between researchers at the Center for Interventions, Treatment and Addictions Research (CITAR) and the Center for Knowledge-Enabled Information Services and Science (Kno.e.sis) at Wright State University. The purpose of this Web-based study is to apply cutting-edge information processing techniques, such as the Semantic Web, Natural Language Processing, and Machine Learning, to qualitative and quantitative content analysis of user generated content to achieve the following aims: 1) Describe drug users' knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to the illicit use of Suboxone(R) (buprenorphine/naloxone) and Subutex(R) (buprenorphine); 2) Identify and describe temporal patterns of the illicit use of these drugs as reflected on web-based forums. To collect data, the study will use websites that allow for the free discussion of illicit drugs, contain information on illicit prescription drug use, and are accessible for public viewing. The study will generate new information about the practices of buprenorphine abuse and will contribute to the advancement of public health and substance abuse research by providing automatic coding and information extraction tools needed to handle rapidly growing Web-based data. Automated information extraction methods applied in this study will enhance current early warning and epidemiological surveillance systems and could advance qualitative and Web-based research methods in other areas of public health.        Building on inter-disciplinary collaboration and cutting-edge information processing techniques, this exploratory, Web-based study will generate new information about Suboxone(R) (buprenorphine/naloxone) and Subutex(R) (buprenorphine) abuse practices, thereby informing public health interventions and policy. It will also contribute to the advancement of public health and substance abuse research methods by providing automatic coding and information extraction tools needed to handle rapidly growing Web-based data.

"New Computational Methods for Data-driven Protein Structure Prediction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proteins play a central role in all biological processes. Akin to the complete sequencing of genomes, complete description of protein structures is a fundamental step towards understanding biological life, and is also highly relevant medically in the development of therapeutics and drugs. The broad, long-term goal of the project is to develop machine learning methods for data-driven protein structure prediction through two independent but complementary strategies: 1) much more accurate template-based modeling for proteins with remote homologs in the Protein Data Bank and 2) better template-free modeling method for proteins without detectable templates and for improving template-based models. The specific aims are: Aim 1) to greatly improve template-based modeling by 1a) improving protein sequence-template alignment using a regression-tree-based nonlinear scoring function, especially when good sequence profiles are unavailable; and 1b) improving fold recognition using a machine learning method to combine both residue-level and atom-level features; Aim 2) to improve protein conformation sampling in a continuous space and thus template-free modeling by three independent but complementary approaches: 2a) modeling nonlinear sequence- structure relationship using Conditional (Markov) Random Fields (CRF) models; 2b) simultaneously sampling secondary and tertiary structure; and 2c) learning structure information from template. The core of the project is to develop various CRF models for data-driven protein structure prediction, by learning protein sequence-structure relationship from existing sequence/structure databases. The product of this research includes a regression-tree-based CRF model for accurate protein alignment, especially for proteins without close homologs in the PDB or without very good sequence profiles; a SVM model for protein fold recognition; a few CRF models for efficient protein conformation sampling in a continuous space; and a complete protein structure prediction software package. Also, it will produce a web server publicly available for various academic and biomedical users. Protein structure prediction will lead to a broad range of biomedical applications, such as the development of novel diagnostics, better understanding of disease processes and improved preventive therapies leading to reduced health care costs.

Novel machine-learning algorithms developed for each person from ankle accelerometers will identify the type, quantity and quality of exercise and walking on a continuous basis. In addition, we will test an inexpensive, instrumented, ergometric pedaler designed for disabled persons, called the UCFit, to promote home-based fitness exercise. The MDAWN and UFCFit sensors send data to an Android smartphone, then over the Internet to a UCLA server for analysis. We will nest further evaluation of the utility of these remote sensing devices within the real-world setting of a clinical trial of patients with recent disabling stroke,for whom formal rehabilitation often falls short of enabling functional walking and cardiovascular fitness. In a phase 2, randomized controlled trial, we will compare two levels of weekly telephonic feedback about daily performance, made possible for the first time by remote data acquisition. The high feedback group will receive everyday performance data that includes the number of bouts and minutes of pedaling plus rate/RPMs and forces used, as well as the number of bouts of walking, duration, and average speed and distance used in home and community. The minimal feedback group only hears about total daily UCFit exercise and walking time. After 4 months of encouraging up to four 30-min sessions per week of UCFit exercise, we will test for a 50% between-group difference in amount of daily exercise and walking time. Secondary outcomes examine change in level of fitness, walking speed, and physical functioning. The two groups then cross over to high or low feedback for 4 more months, before outcomes are reassessed. Then, no feedback is given and participants are tested for amount of exercise and fitness at 12 months. We will determine which form of feedback motivates better self-management to optimize fitness and walking. We will gather unique data about mobility in the transition from rehabilitation hospital to home; quantify gait training durin usual care; assess walking skills under more complex conditions than in a laboratory; and test the responsiveness of sensor data as a ratio scale outcome measurement during a time of expected gains. This study will be the first comprehensive demonstration of mHealth remote monitoring and outcome measures of daily physical activity!          Several important public health needs will be met by testing, within a clinical trial in the home and community, a system of wearable activity and exercise monitoring technologies that measure the type, quantity and quality of walking and exercise. Our trial aims to increase fitness and enable more functional levels of daily activities in disable persons after stroke, while providing a proof-of-principle for the utility of wireless health toolsto reliably monitor real-world physical functioning and to provide clinically meaningful outcome measures. These generic tools for daily care and research can be deployed across diseases and disabilities.

"Clinical Image Retrieval: User needs assessment toolbox development & evaluation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Advances in digital imaging technologies have led to a substantial growth in the number of digital images being created and stored in hospitals, medical systems, and on the Internet in recent years. Effective medical image retrieval systems can play an important role in teaching, research, diagnosis and treatment. Images were historically retrieved using text-based methods. The quality of annotations associated with images can reduce the effectiveness of text-based image retrieval. Despite recent advances, purely content- based image retrieval techniques lag significantly behind their textual counterparts in their ability to capture the semantic essence of the user's query. Preliminary research suggests that a more promising approach is to adaptively combine these complementary techniques to suit the user and their information needs. However, for these approaches to succeed, the researcher needs to enhance her computational skills in addition to acquiring a comprehensive understanding of the relevant clinical domain. This Pathway to Independence (K99/R00) grant application describes a training and career development plan that will allow the candidate, an NLM postdoctoral fellow in Medical Informatics at Oregon Health & Science University to achieve these objectives. The training component will be carried out under the mentorship of Dr. W. Hersh with Dr. Gorman (user studies). Dr. Fuss (radiation medicine) and Dr. Erdogmus (machine learning) providing additional mentoring in their areas of expertise.       The long-term goal of this Pathway to Independence (K99/R00) project is to improve visual information retrieval by better understanding user needs and proposing adaptive methodologies for multimodal image retrieval that will close the semantic gap. During the award period, activities will be focused on the following specific aims: (1) Understand the image retrieval needs of novice and expert users in radiation oncology and develop gold standards for evaluation; (2) Develop algorithms for semantic, multimodal image retrieval; (3) Perform user based evaluation of adaptive image retrieval in radiation oncology; (4) Extend the techniques developed to create a multimodal image retrieval system in pathology          ",Clinical Image Retrieval: User needs assessment toolbox development & evaluation,8522304,R00LM009889,"['Accounting ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomy ', ' Archives ', ' Award ', ' Dorsum ', ' Back ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diagnostic Imaging ', ' Diffusion ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Feedback ', ' Goals ', ' Au element ', ' Gold ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Hospitals ', ' Interview ', ' Judgment ', ' Learning ', ' Libraries ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Lung ', ' Maps ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Medical Informatics ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Metric System ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' Oregon ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Quality Control ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Semantics ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Students ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Teaching ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Vocabulary Words ', ' Vocabulary ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Information Retrieval ', ' Measures ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Visual ', ' satisfaction ', ' Development Plans ', ' Radiation Oncology ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' oncology ', ' malignant head and neck tumor ', ' Malignant Head and Neck Neoplasm ', ' Head and Neck Cancer ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Techniques ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' meetings ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' computer imaging ', ' digital imaging ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' care delivery ', ' treatment planning ', ' Distance Learning ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' Reporting ', ' Pathology Report ', ' ray (radiation) ', ' Radiation ', ' career development ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Property ', ' cancer location ', ' cancer site ', ' Effectiveness ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' Address ', ' Affinity ', ' Data ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Multimodal Imaging ', ' NCI Organization ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' Retrieval ', ' Ontology ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Text ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Output ', ' biomed informatics ', ' biomedical informatics ', ' Imaging technology ', ' Image retrieval system ', ' open source ', ' visual information ', ' information model ', ' ']",NLM,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R00,2013,216041,MA-08,0.03852502191209953
"Ancillary Comparative Effectiveness of Atrial Fibrillation Ablation Surgery    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This proposal describes an ancillary study to a recently initiated comparative effectiveness trial ""Surgical Ablation versus No Surgical Ablation for Patients with Persistent or Longstanding Persistent Atrial Fibrillation Undergoing Mitral Valve Surgery"" (NCT00903370), which is part of the NHLBI-sponsored Cardiothoracic Surgery Network (CTSN). Its aims are to perform a time-sensitive substudy of continuous heart rhythm monitoring and to develop and apply novel statistical tools to assess ablation effectiveness in groups of patients. As such, it will provide critical new knowledge to support a secondary objective of the parent trial: to inform rhythm monitoring and analysis strategies for future trials of rhythm control in atrial fibrillation (AF).  Great enthusiasm for innovative tissue-destroying (ablation) procedures to treat AF has led to technology outstripping science. Mechanisms of AF (which afflicts >3 million Americans) remain poorly understood, methods to assess its cure are primitive, and guidelines for analyzing rhythm outcomes are flawed due to lack of appropriate statistical methodology. Why? After ablation procedures, AF may recur in episodes of varying duration. Yet current monitoring consists of ""snapshots"" of semiannual rhythm recording (Holter), or more frequent-but short-transtelephonic monitoring (TTM). Ideally, an implantable monitoring device could detect all these episodes over a patient's lifetime; however, even if this were possible, statistical methods to analyze this series of occurrences in groups of patients for comparative effectiveness of AF therapies or to identify risk factors are poorly developed. Right now a window of opportunity exists to make important strides in more thorough AF assessment and proper data analysis because the CTSN has just launched a randomized trial of surgical AF therapies that includes weekly TTM of atrial rhythm as well as traditional 6- and 12-month Holter assessment. We propose a time-sensitive substudy of implanting an FDA-approved miniature loop recorder to capture AF episodes continuously. These data will be used in the development of a suite of new analytic methods for aggregating data such as these across time and across patients to characterize time course and identify modulating factors. They will then be used to assess the trial's rhythm endpoints and suggest designs for more informative future trials with substantially reduced sample size. We have assembled a team of clinicians and statisticians, including individuals who designed the parent trial, who are experienced in implanting the monitoring device, and who are experts in analytic methods research, to develop and apply novel methods to these several types of rhythm data. We will leverage developments from an intramural NHLBI machine learning program at Cleveland Clinic and State of Ohio-funded Atrial Fibrillation Innovation Center. The analytic methods have wide applicability to the important field of longitudinal data analysis.    A chaotic heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation (AF), which affects more than 3 million Americans, especially the elderly, causes strokes, and commonly accompanies heart valve disease. AF treatments outstrip scientific understanding of the rhythm and how to assess treatment success across time in clinical trials. Thus, the Institute of Medicine has placed trials of AF treatment in the first tier of 100 comparative effectiveness priorities for the nation. An NIH-sponsored trial of surgical treatment of AF is has just been launched, and we propose a substudy of an implanted rhythm monitoring device (Medtronic REVEAL XT) and new methods of AF analysis for groups of patients that will help assess the trial's endpoints and inform future trials. Thus, this ancillary study application proposes to (1) collect, in a subset of patients, more refined rhythm data than proposed in the parent trial, (2) develop generalizable new methods of analysis, and (3) apply these methods to both the data collected through continuous monitoring as well as the follow-up data collected in the parent trial through Holter and trans-telephonic monitoring.

"Context Understanding Technology to improve internet accessibility for users with     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this SBIR project is to develop a new tool to improve the ability of blind and visually impaired people to quickly get to the right web pages, to avoid ending up on the wrong web pages, and to reach the desired part of each web page efficiently. The motivation for this effort is that getting a 'big picture' understanding of a web page is one of the biggest challenges facing this population of computer users. Existing tools for blind and visually impaired people, such as screen readers and screen magnifiers, present the entire web page serially, in full detail, either by textual output of the details, or b providing a magnified view of a small part of the page. However, if the user is not already familiar with the website, the resulting lack of context requires a laborious and time-consuming process to scan through sometimes hundreds of details before knowing whether anything of interest even exists on the page in question. In contrast, the proposed technology analyzes web pages in a similar way that sighted users quickly scan pages before reading in detail, to provide a succinct, informative guidance on the context and layout of the page, so that a user quickly gains a much richer ""big-picture"" understanding. The proposed Phase II project builds on a successful Phase I user evaluation of a proof- of-concept of the software, in which users expressed a strong preference for the contextual cues provided by the approach. Phase II includes creating a fully-functional prototype of the software tool. Throughout the technology development, feedback from users and practitioners will guide the path of the R&D for maximum usability. At the conclusion of Phase II, an end-user, in-home evaluation study will verify the effectiveness of the tool, providing the starting point for full-scale commercialization.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The R&D in this Phase II SBIR project will result in an improved way to use the Internet for individuals with visual disabilities. The technology will help to overcome the lack of accessibility and high level of frustration currently found among blind and visually impaired users. The results of the project will enable such individuals to explore new opportunities and be more productive, thus providing improved employment potential and an increase in the quality of life.                ",Context Understanding Technology to improve internet accessibility for users with,8459121,R44EY020082,"['Arizona ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Boxing ', ' Color ', ' Computers ', ' Cues ', ' Employment ', ' Evaluation Studies ', ' Feedback ', ' Frustration ', ' Government ', ' Interest Group ', ' Literature ', ' Marketing ', ' Motivation ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' Persons ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' research and development ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Software Tools ', ' Speech ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' visually impaired ', ' Subnormal Vision ', ' Reduced Vision ', ' Partial Sight ', ' Low Vision ', ' Diminished Vision ', ' Visual impairment ', ' Generations ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' tool ', ' Scanning ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' visually impaired people ', ' blind person ', ' blind people ', ' blind individual ', ' Visually Impaired Persons ', ' interest ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' technology development ', ' phrases ', ' Advertisements ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Reader ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' SBIRS (R43/44) ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' groupings ', ' Grouping ', ' Text ', ' Output ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' blind ', ' Population ', ' usability ', ' prototype ', ' commercialization ', ' public health relevance ', ' webpage ', ' web page ', ' natural language ', ' ']",NEI,"VORTANT TECHNOLOGIES, LLC",R44,2013,371933,NC-11,0.04365435737411122
"Artificial Intelligence in a Mobile Intervention for Depression (AIM)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary aim of this proposal is to develop and evaluate the use of state of the art machine learning approaches within a mobile intervention application for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). Machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, focuses on the development of algorithms that automatically improve and evolve based on collected data. Machine learning models can learn to detect complex, latent patterns in data and apply such knowledge to decision making in real time. The proposed intervention, called IntelliCare, will use ongoing data collected from the patient and intervention application to continuously adapt intervention content, content form, and motivational messaging to create a highly tailored and user-responsive treatment system. Behavioral intervention technologies (BITs), including web-based and mobile interventions, have been developed and are increasingly being used to treat MDD. BITs are moderately effective in treating depression, particularly when guided by human coaching via email or telephone. However, lack of personalization and inability to adapt to patient needs or preferences, which results in a perceived lack of relevance, contributes to poorer adherence and outcomes. IntelliCare will be designed as a mobile application, but will be accessible via computer web browsers and tablets. The IntelliCare machine learning framework will use individual data obtained from use data (e.g., length of time using a treatment component), embedded sensors in the phone (e.g., GPS), and the user's self-reports (e.g., ""like"" and usefulness ratings of treatment components) to provide a highly tailored intervention that can learn from the patient and adapt intervention and motivational materials to the patient's preferences and state. Low intensity coaching will serve as a backstop to support adherence. This project will contain three phases.  Phase 1 will involve the development of IntelliCare and its optimization through usability testing.  Phase 2 will be a field trial of 200 users who will receive IntelliCare for 12 weeks. The field trial has two aims: first to complete usability testing and optimization of the treatment framework, and second to develop the machine learning models and algorithms. Phase 3 will subject IntelliCare to a double blind, randomized controlled trial, comparing it to MobilCare. MobilCare will be identical to IntelliCare except that it will use standard presentation and presentation, rather than machine learning, to provide treatment and motivational materials. We will recruit half the participants from primary care settings, as this is the de facto site for treatment of depression in the United States, and half through the Internet, which is the main portal to health apps. The application of adaptive machine learning analytics to a mobile intervention has the potential to create a new generation of BITs that could revolutionize the way that such interventions are conceptualized, designed, and deployed. These innovations would have broad consequences and could be extended a broader range of BITS, including web- based interventions, and to other interventions targeting a wide range of health and mental health problems.            PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will create and evaluate IntelliCare, a mobile intervention also accessible by web browser, for depression. IntelliCare will harness modern adaptive machine learning analytics that can learn from a user's activity on the application, embedded phone sensors, and patient report to tailor intervention elements and motivational messaging to the needs and preferences of the user. This unprecedented level of tailoring could revolutionize the way such interventions are conceptualized, designed, and deployed.                   ",Artificial Intelligence in a Mobile Intervention for Depression (AIM),8496352,R01MH100482,"['post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' Aftercare ', ' Algorithms ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Australia ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Computers ', ' Decision Making ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Double-Masked Study ', ' Double-Masked Method ', ' Double-Blinded ', ' Double-Blind Study ', ' Double-Blind Method ', ' Email ', ' E-Mail ', ' Electronic Mail ', ' Elements ', ' employee assistance program ', ' Employee Assistance Program (Health Care) ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Recommendation ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' tablet (pharmacologic) ', ' Tablets ', ' Technology ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Testing ', ' fabric ', ' Textiles ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Veterans Affairs (U.S.) ', ' Veterans Administration ', ' United States Veterans Administration ', ' United States Department of Veterans Affairs ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Mediating ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Phase ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Individual ', ' satisfaction ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' tool ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Depressed mood ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Knowledge ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' meetings ', ' preference ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Car Phone ', ' major depression ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' Length ', ' Adherence ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Data ', ' Testred ', ' Testovis ', ' Testotonic B ', ' Testomet ', ' Oreton methyl ', ' Orchisterone-M ', ' Neohombreol M ', ' Metandren ', ' Malogen ', ' Estratest ', ' Ero Test ', ' Eldec ', ' Android ', ' Glosso-Sterandryl ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cost ', ' care systems ', ' time use ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' psychopharmacological ', ' psychopharmacologic ', ' web-enabled ', ' web-accessible ', ' tailored messaging ', ' usability ', ' trial comparing ', ' treatment site ', ' motivational intervention ', ' public health relevance ', ' primary care setting ', ' secondary outcome ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' Secure ', ' ']",NIMH,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2013,636036,IL-07,-0.00803044776946765
"Smart Anatomic Recognition System to Guide Emergency Intubation and Resuscitation     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over 3 million emergency intubations are performed in the US every year and failure rates can be as high as 50% (3-5). Success is highly dependent on how frequently the responder performs this life-saving procedure on humans (6). Brio Device, LLC, an airway management medical device company, is addressing the need to decouple the success of the procedure from the experience of the user with their ""smart"" intubation device which integrates anatomic structure recognition algorithms and visual guidance feedback with an articulating stylet. Brio's intubation device is specifically designed fo the needs of emergency responders, such as paramedics, emergency department personnel, code teams in hospitals and military medics, who often arrive at the patient first. The smart intubation device will reduce failure rates by providing the user with visual instruction of the correct path to the trachea as he places the endotracheal tube. The guidance software uses machine learning and computer vision algorithms to recognize the anatomy and determine the path to insert the tube. Ultimately, the intubation device will include both a guidance display on an LCD screen and an optical stylet that has single-axis angulation control of the distal tip. For the purpose of this Phase I study, a laptop or desktop computer will be used for the image processing and the guidance display that accompanies the articulating stylet. The long-term goal is to create a device that is compact, light-weight and portable to suit the needs of ambulances and hospital crash carts.  The hypothesis for this study is that by incorporating a video guidance display with an articulating stylet, inexperienced users will be more successful in correctly placing the endotracheal tube using this device compared to direct laryngoscopy. To achieve this goal, image processing and machine learning algorithms will be developed to recognize key anatomic structures in the airway. Software will also be developed determine the path the tube should follow and to display this information for the user. Finally, the efficacy of the device will be validated in airway simulation mannequins with medical students serving as the inexperienced users. Phase II will focus on integrating the guidance software, articulating optical stylet and display into a portable device with embedded hardware and software contained within the stylet handle. At completion of Phase II, the device will be ready for clinica trials and FDA testing.  Brio will enter the $20 billion airway market with its intubation device. Initial sales will begin with anesthesiologists who are early adopters of new technology to assist with difficult airways. Brio will market its product to ~327,000 clinicians who use intubation devices. The U.S. addressable market for emergency intubation is ~$900M for the 41,000 ambulances and 5,800 emergency departments and hospital code teams.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this SBIR Phase I, Brio Device, LLC plans to create and evaluate a device that improves the success rate of emergency intubations by coupling a smart guidance display with a user-controlled single-axis articulating stylet. Emergency intubations are often performed in challenging situations by personnel who do the procedure infrequently. Since failure rates are as high as 50% and approximately 180,000 deaths occur each year from failed pre-hospital intubations, a device is needed to provide visual guidance information to assist the users and increase their success rates in emergency situations.            ",Smart Anatomic Recognition System to Guide Emergency Intubation and Resuscitation,8453607,R43HL114160,"['Algorithms ', ' Ambulances ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomy ', ' cerebral death ', ' Coma Depasse ', ' Brain Dead ', ' Brain Death ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' computer vision ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' Computers ', ' Critical Care ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Emergencies ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Feedback ', ' Goals ', ' Hospitals ', ' Military Hospitals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Intubation ', ' Laryngoscopy ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Lung ', ' Mannequins ', ' Manikins ', ' Marketing ', ' Medical Device ', ' Military ', ' Armed Forces Personnel ', ' Military Personnel ', ' optical ', ' Optics ', ' O2 element ', ' O element ', ' Oxygen ', ' Paramedic ', ' Paramedical Personnel ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Resuscitation ', ' Sales ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Medical Students ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' windpipe ', ' Trachea Proper ', ' Trachea ', ' Destinations ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Visualization ', ' Imagery ', ' Tube ', ' image processing ', ' Laryngoscopes ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Left ', ' Distal ', ' Phase ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' Visual ', ' brain lesion (from injury) ', ' brain damage ', ' Acquired brain injury ', ' Brain Injuries ', ' light (weight) ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' laptop ', ' endotracheal ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Devices ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Human Resources ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Address ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' SBIRS (R43/44) ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Instruction ', ' information display ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Coupling ', ' commercial application ', ' public health relevance ', ' secondary outcome ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' Phase I Study ', ' phase 1 study ', ' ']",NHLBI,"BRIO DEVICE, LLC",R43,2013,244710,MI-12,0.01602223528636784
"Context-Sensitive Search of Human Expression Compendia    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gene expression experiments are an abundant and robust source of functional genomics data, with thousands of microarray and a growing number of high throughput RNA sequencing studies publicly available, most interrogating clinical and biological systems relevant to disease. They hold the promise of data-driven characterization of gene function and regulation, including in specific tissues, cell lines, and disease states, and can advance the understanding and modeling of regulatory changes that form the basis of human disease. However, these data remain largely underutilized, as biology researchers do not have effective tools to explore and analyze the entire data collection to generate novel hypotheses and direct experiments. The situation is similar to that of the Internet before the search engines - a biology researcher has to know a priori which datasets pertain to the biological question she is asking, reflect the tissue/cell-lineage specific signals of interest to her, and accurately measure the expression of genes related to her pathways of interest. There is a clear need for methods that will enable biology researchers to use their domain-specific knowledge to direct their exploration of public human expression data, enabling them to generate hypotheses and direct experiments addressing challenging biomedical questions. Such a system should provide users with ability to effectively explore automatically identified datasets relevant to their biological question of interest, leverage metazoan complexity including cell lineage and disease specific signals, and allow the researcher to securely include their unpublished data in the analysis. To address these challenges, this proposal describes a ""Google-style"" public search engine for large collections of gene expression data built using novel search algorithms and leveraging cloud-computing technologies. This system implements a novel query-based context-sensitive algorithm for search of large expression compendia that exploits the complexity of metazoan organisms, including cell-lineage complexity and disease aspects inherent to human expression studies. Furthermore, the challenge of heterogeneity in human samples will be addressed by developing novel hierarchical learning methods to predict cell-lineage or tissue-specific gene expression based on the compendium and to identify these signals in each dataset. This will enable users to explore tissue-specific expression and also will be integrated with the search algorithm to improve search accuracy. Proposed algorithms, search engine, and user interface will be extensively evaluated in close collaboration with biology researchers, and top predictions will be tested experimentally. These methods will be implemented in a user-friendly public search system that will leverage cloud computing to provide robust interactive query response and will enable biology researchers to explore both published data collections and their own pre-publication datasets in a context-specific, integrated, and secure manner.        We will develop a ""Google-style"" search engine for massive collections of human gene expression data. Our system will enable researchers to use their domain knowledge to explore the entirety of public human expression data to generate hypotheses and direct experiments addressing a diverse range of challenging biomedical questions. Public availability of our system will advance genome-level understanding of human biology and facilitate development of novel drugs, therapies, and personalized medical treatments.

"SLASH: SCALABLE LARGE ANALYTIC SEGMENTATION HYBRID DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Advanced instrumentation and cellular imaging techniques using high-throughput 3D electron microscopy are driving a new revolution in the exploration of complex biological systems by providing near seamless views across multiple scales of resolution. These datasets provide the necessary breadth and depth to analyze multicellular, cellular, and subcelluar structure across large swathes of neural tissue. While these new imaging procedures are generating extremely large datasets of enormous value, the quantities are such that no single user or even laboratory team can possibly analyze the full content of their own imaging activities through traditional means. To address this challenge, we propose to further develop and refine a prototype hybrid system for high-throughput segmentation of large neuropil datasets that: 1) advances automatic algorithms for segmentation of cellular and sub-cellular structures using machine learning techniques; 2) couples these techniques to a scalable and flexible process or tool suite allowing multiple users to simultaneously review, edit and curate the results of these automatic approaches; and, 3) builds a knowledge base of training data guiding and improving automated processing. This system will allow project scientists to select areas of interest, execute automatic segmentation algorithms, and distribute workload, curate data, and deposit final results into the Cell Centered Database (Martone et al. 2008) via accessible web-interfaces. Emerging techniques in cellular and subcellular 3D imaging are generating datasets of enormous value to the study of disease processes and to the pursuit of greater insight into the structure and function of the nervous system. To unlock the potential of these data, new solutions are needed to improve the capability to segment and label the individual molecular, subcellular and cellular components within very large volumetric expanses.

"Brain Science Computer Cluster     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Computational requirements of contemporary brain science research often exceed financial and resource management limits of individual investigator laboratories. Many contemporary neuroscience research projects require analysis of large data sets with advanced statistical methods and anatomical reconstruction techniques. These methods require high speed computational and graphics engines operating in a multiple processor environments equipped with large capacity, high-speed storage devices. A limitation in the Brown brain science effort at understanding neural processing is the lack of a readily accessible high-speed computational resource. A central computational resource based on a unified cluster of contemporary Linux CPUs and GPUs will serve the computational needs of a core group of brain science investigators at Brown without compromising individual access common to stand-alone workstations. The requested computer cluster has system software that automatically balances CPU and GPU usage, thereby ensuring maximum access to the computational resource for all users. Intensive 3D graphics are off-loaded either to GPUs or to client workstations, thereby further reducing the central computational load. Commercial or open-source software with an open operating environment will be used for analysis using standard and novel statistical and machine learning approaches to assess significance of large data sets. This proposal details the architecture and benefits of a contemporary computational resource for the major and minor users, and more generally the Brown brain science community. The resource was designed to fill immediate and near-term computational and storage needs of a core group of Brown brain scientists. The system can be readily expansion as needs, either computational, storage, or new users, arise. Expansion of the existing core investigators group can occur easily since the computational power or storage capacity of the system can be readily enhanced at relatively low cost. The flexible nature of the system will serve a variety of research needs of the Brown brain science community. The computational resource is expected to bring together researchers at Brown working on the common problem of neural processing.             ",Brain Science Computer Cluster,8447697,S10OD016366,"['Engineering / Architecture ', ' Architecture ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Client ', ' Communities ', ' Environment ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Laboratories ', ' Methods ', ' Minor ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Science ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Work ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Nature ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Scientist ', ' Techniques ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Speed ', ' Speed (motion) ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Neurosciences Research ', ' Process ', ' cost ', ' reconstruction ', ' software systems ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Linux ', ' computational resources ', ' computing resources ', ' open source ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' computer cluster ', ' ']",OD,BROWN UNIVERSITY,S10,2013,599598,RI-01,0.016325381534695333
"Cloud Based Resource for Data Hosting, Visualization and Analysis Using UCSC Canc     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cancer genomics resources are growing at an unprecedented pace. However, a comprehensive analysis of the cancer genome still remains a daunting challenge. This is in part due to the difficulties in visualizing, integrating, and analyzng cancer genomics data with current technologies. We propose to develop a cloud-based platform to empower researchers with the ability to host, visualize and analyze their own data. The platform is composed of a set of Cancer Analytics Virtual Machines (CAVMs). The main component of each CAVM is a data server which functions to store and serve user data to applications, such as the UCSC Cancer Genomics Browser, to provide data visualization. The second component is a modified Galaxy workflow system to provide data analysis capability. UCSC's suite of analysis tools for nextgen sequencing data analysis and pathway inference will be prepackaged with the system. The two components will be highly integrated to allow tightly coupled cycles of data visualization and analysis. The data server component will be modular such that it can provide data independently to applications besides the Cancer Browser and Galaxy. We will deliver virtual machine images that can be easily initiated in a commercial cloud such as Amazon, or can be installed within a user's own institution. The CAVM also functions as a way for users to Integrate with external large-scale databases. We will deliver a UCSC CAVM that other CAVM instances can connect to, to provide authorized data access from the UCSC cancer genomics data repository. The system allows the dynamic formation of new datasets composed of data slices from multiple sources. This ability to combine data into larger samples will provide the statistical power to allow discoveries that would otherwise not be possible. We aim to eliminate, or significantly reduce, the overhead of system configuration and software installation. Our tools will provide users the capability to access a cloud-based cluster computing environment, which will make sophisticated, computationally intensive analyses accessible to researchers who might not, have access to compute servers. The software platform we develop can be used by individual bench biologists, and also by large projects to serve data to individual users or to other projects. This design has the potential to form an expansive federated database accessible through the same software interface.         RELEVANCE: Currently, clinicians and bench biologists typically depend on external collaborators for data analysis. The proposed system will provide these scientists with data analysis and visualization methods that are both powerful and easy to use. This will accelerate research in the understanding and treatment of cancer, the second-leading cause of death in the U.S.              ","Cloud Based Resource for Data Hosting, Visualization and Analysis Using UCSC Canc",8607380,U24CA180951,"['neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Environment ', ' Genome ', ' Methods ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Science ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' synapse ', ' Synaptic ', ' Synapses ', ' Technology ', ' Work ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Ecological Systems ', ' Ecologic Systems ', ' Ecosystem ', ' Visualization ', ' Imagery ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Galaxy ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Source ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' empowered ', ' secondary cancer ', ' Secondary Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Secondary Malignancy (After Treatment of Primary Cancer) ', ' Secondary Malignancy ', ' Second Cancer ', ' Second Primary Cancers ', ' Sampling ', ' repository ', ' Genomics ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer therapy ', ' text mining ', ' literature searching ', ' literature mining ', ' discovery mining ', ' text searching ', ' Institution ', ' Data ', ' Collection ', ' Slice ', ' Update ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' oncogenomics ', ' cancer genomics ', ' cancer genome ', ' virtual ', ' data integration ', ' grid computing ', ' distributed computing ', ' datagrid ', ' data grid ', ' computational grid ', ' cluster computing ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Coupled ', ' large-scale data base ', ' large-scale database ', ' web interface ', ' sharing data ', ' federated database ', ' federated data ', ' federated computing ', ' TCGA ', ' The Cancer Genome Atlas ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ,U24,2013,621154,CA-20,0.03463301236792748
"Noninvasive Assessment of Neuromuscular Disease using Electrical Impedance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The neuromuscular disorders include a wide group of conditions ranging from relatively mild focal problems, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, to severe, generalized diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Current methods for evaluating these disorders remain limited to a variety of tests and procedures that are either invasive or remarkably qualitative in nature. One newer technique, electrical impedance myography (EIM), offers the prospect of obtaining quantitative data on muscle condition painlessly and non-invasively. However, no commercial devices specifically tailored for EIM use exist, with nearly all previous EIM work relying upon off-the-shelf bioimpedance devices designed for ""whole-body"" rather than single-muscle assessment. In Phase 1 of this SBIR, Convergence Medical Devices, Inc (CMD) developed an initial prototype system to test proof-of-principle innovative concepts in circuit design and data acquisition to provide highly sensitive and accurate data at an extended frequency range (out to 10 MHz) and over multiple angles relative to the major muscle fiber direction. This work was followed by supplemental work that produced the first hand-held device with robust electronics capable of similar measurements with a detachable, interchangeable electrode array. In this 3-year Phase 2 SBIR, CMD proposes to further refine that technology so as to assist in disease diagnosis and for following disease progression, with a specific focus on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In Aim 1 of the proposed grant, testing of multiple electrode array designs will be performed on a group of normal subjects and those with ALS to determine which electrode array designs offer the greatest reproducibility and ability to discriminate healthy from diseased individuals. In Aim 2, the device and the 3 ""best"" array designs identified in Aim 1 will be tested in 30 ALS patients, 30 patients with syndromes mimicking ALS (e.g., polyradiculopathy and motor-predominant neuropathy), and 30 subjects with suspected/possible ALS to determine the single best array design for diagnosis and to determine its sensitivity and specificity. This study will take place at CMD and four external sites and will be managed by the Northeast ALS trials Consortium (NEALS), the premier organization for overseeing clinical trials in ALS. In Aim 3, the 30 suspected/possible ALS patients recruited in SA2 and 30 additional suspected/possible ALS patients will be assessed monthly using EIM and the 3 arrays identified in SA1. All subjects will also undergo standard measurements of disease progression including handheld dynamometry, ALS Functional Rating Scale, and spirometry. The best array design for assessing disease progression will be identified and compared to conventional markers of disease progression to determine EIM's sensitivity to disease status. Thus, at the conclusion of this research program, we anticipate having developed and vigorously tested an EIM device and associated electrode designs that together will serve as a powerful new diagnostic and monitoring tool for neuromuscular disease.          The neuromuscular disorders are a group of conditions that impact the lives of millions of people in the United States alone. In this study, Convergence Medical Devices, in collaboration with neurologists at several medical centers, will develop and test a new device based on the concept of electrical impedance myography, a technique that offers the promise of rapid and accurate disease assessment. With the completion of this study, a new, painless tool will be developed and studied that will assist in individual patient care and will speed drug testing in clinical trials in diseases ranging from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and muscular dystrophy to radiculopathy and polyneuropathy.

"Coding of auditory space in the avian brain DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): All auditory information used for sound localization ascends through the brainstem auditory nuclei. We will use physiological and theoretical approaches to understand how multidimensional features of sound, relevant to sound localization, are processed and encoded in the avian auditory brainstem. A primary advantage of using barn owls for the exploration of auditory processing is the substantial body of behavioral, anatomical and neurophysiological work that has elucidated the mechanisms of sound localization. The main cues owls use to compute sound direction are the interaural level difference (ILD) and the interaural time difference (ITD). Unlike mammals, owls use ILD to determine the vertical coordinate of the sound source and ITD to determine the horizontal coordinate. Two independent brainstem pathways process ITD and ILD and converge in the midbrain, where a spatiotopic map of auditory space emerges. Activity of neurons in the map precedes, and stimulation evokes, a head-orienting response towards the sound source. Thus, in barn owls, the neural algorithm for sound localization can be viewed as a system in which two input variables (ITD and ILD) are processed in parallel in order to control two output variables (horizontal and vertical coordinates of head saccades). We have used theoretical models to describe the neural responses that encode spatial information in the owl's auditory system. This approach has guided our experiments and aided the interpretation of our findings. Behavioral experiments in humans have used a similar approach to sound localization. However, due to a lack of neural data in humans, the predictive power of models of sound localization with regard to the neural bases of behavior has been a persistent question. Our studies in barn owls address this issue by investigating the mechanism of neural computations that are fundamental to models developed for human sound localization. This proposal is organized around three primary questions: 1) What are the computational primitives of auditory-space processing in the owl's brainstem? 2) How is spectrotemporal information encoded, transmitted and processed in parallel with spatial information? 3) What fundamental changes in information coding occur at the crossroads between the auditory midbrain and forebrain? We will address these questions using a wide range of strategies and techniques - intracellular in vivo recordings, cell-attached recording in vivo, multi-neuron tetrode recording, and modeling - which will make our approach interdisciplinary and of broad scope. Our research seeks to understand the function of the auditory brainstem and midbrain. In doing so, we will identify the types of information that are available to upstream nuclei and show how this information is encoded. A comprehensive approach to information processing in the auditory brainstem has the potential to provide new avenues for better understanding disorders of the central auditory system and cognitive impairments involving hearing. By linking biology and engineering, mathematical formulations of brain processes can advance technology related to robotics and neural prosthetics. Cochlear implants that provide encoding of stimuli in ways that are more biologically relevant can be built, while devices acting downstream of the cochlea could aid patients with compromised or non-functional auditory nerves. By its differences and similarities with other species, the avian brain provides an excellent model system to define fundamental properties of neural processing and neural coding.

"Continued development of CellProfiler cell image analysis software Most laboratories studying biological processes and human disease use light/fluorescence microscopes to image cells and other biological samples. There is strong and growing demand for software to analyze these images, as automated microscopes collect images faster than can be examined by eye and the information sought from images is increasingly quantitative and complex. We have begun to address this demand with CellProfiler, a versatile, open-source software tool for quantifying data from biological images, particularly in high-throughput experiments (www.cellprofiler.org). CellProfiler can extract valuable biological information from images quickly while increasing the objectivity and statistical power of assays. In the three years since its release, it has become widely used, having been downloaded more than 8,000 times by users in over 60 countries. Using CellProfiler's point-and-click interface, researchers build a customized chain of image analysis modules to identify and measure biological objects in images. The software evolved in an intensely collaborative and interdisciplinary research environment with dozens of ongoing projects and has been successfully applied to a wide range of biological samples and assays, from counting cells to scoring complex phenotypes by machine learning. To enable further biological imaging research, meet the needs of the growing user base, and expand the community that benefits from CellProfiler, we propose to improve its capabilities, interface, and support: First, we will add user-requested capabilities, leveraging existing open-source projects by interoperating with them where feasible. These new features will include object tracking in time-lapse movies, compatibility with additional file formats, new image processing algorithms, and expanded tools for quality control, performance evaluation, cluster computing, and workflow management. Second, we will improve the interface, increase processing speed, and simplify the addition of new features by refactoring and porting the MATLAB-based code to an open-source language and instituting proven software development practices. Third, we will provide user, educator, and developer support and outreach for CellProfiler. These activities will facilitate research in the scientific community and help guide usability improvements. These improvements to the only open-source software for modular, high-throughput biological image analysis will enable hundreds of NIH-funded laboratories to make high-impact biological discoveries from cell images across all disciplines within biology. Most laboratories studying biological processes and human disease use microscopy to analyze cells and  other samples. We will enable these researchers to rapidly and accurately extract numerical data from  microscopy images by continuing to develop and support our user-friendly, open-source cell image  analysis software, CellProfiler (www.cellprofiler.org).",Continued development of CellProfiler cell image analysis software,8479372,R01GM089652,"['Algorithms ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biology ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Cell Number ', ' Cell Count ', ' Cells ', ' Communities ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Email ', ' E-Mail ', ' Electronic Mail ', ' Environment ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye ', ' Grant ', ' Institutes ', ' Laboratories ', ' Language ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Manuals ', ' Microscopy ', ' Persons ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Paper ', ' Phenotype ', ' Quality Control ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Software Tools ', ' Stains ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Process Measure ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' Microscope ', ' improved ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Biological ', ' Evaluation ', ' Discipline ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Country ', ' Stainings ', ' Staining method ', ' meetings ', ' processing speed ', ' Performance ', ' resource guides ', ' Speed ', ' Speed (motion) ', ' movie ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Laboratory Study ', ' outreach ', ' laboratory fluorescence light microscope ', ' fluorescent microscope ', ' fluorescence/UV microscope ', ' Ultraviolet Microscopes ', ' UV laboratory microscope ', ' fluorescence microscope ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' repository ', ' developing computer software ', ' develop software ', ' software development ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Whole Organism ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cell imaging ', ' cellular imaging ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' grid computing ', ' distributed computing ', ' datagrid ', ' data grid ', ' computational grid ', ' cluster computing ', ' interoperability ', ' file format ', ' user-friendly ', ' web interface ', ' open source ', ' human disease ', ' usability ', ' ']",NIGMS,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",R01,2013,474880,MA-07,0.025239184008395133
"Cloud Based Resource for Data Hosting, Visualization and Analysis Using UCSC Canc     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cancer genomics resources are growing at an unprecedented pace. However, a comprehensive analysis of the cancer genome still remains a daunting challenge. This is in part due to the difficulties in visualizing, integrating, and analyzng cancer genomics data with current technologies. We propose to develop a cloud-based platform to empower researchers with the ability to host, visualize and analyze their own data. The platform is composed of a set of Cancer Analytics Virtual Machines (CAVMs). The main component of each CAVM is a data server which functions to store and serve user data to applications, such as the UCSC Cancer Genomics Browser, to provide data visualization. The second component is a modified Galaxy workflow system to provide data analysis capability. UCSC's suite of analysis tools for nextgen sequencing data analysis and pathway inference will be prepackaged with the system. The two components will be highly integrated to allow tightly coupled cycles of data visualization and analysis. The data server component will be modular such that it can provide data independently to applications besides the Cancer Browser and Galaxy. We will deliver virtual machine images that can be easily initiated in a commercial cloud such as Amazon, or can be installed within a user's own institution. The CAVM also functions as a way for users to Integrate with external large-scale databases. We will deliver a UCSC CAVM that other CAVM instances can connect to, to provide authorized data access from the UCSC cancer genomics data repository. The system allows the dynamic formation of new datasets composed of data slices from multiple sources. This ability to combine data into larger samples will provide the statistical power to allow discoveries that would otherwise not be possible. We aim to eliminate, or significantly reduce, the overhead of system configuration and software installation. Our tools will provide users the capability to access a cloud-based cluster computing environment, which will make sophisticated, computationally intensive analyses accessible to researchers who might not, have access to compute servers. The software platform we develop can be used by individual bench biologists, and also by large projects to serve data to individual users or to other projects. This design has the potential to form an expansive federated database accessible through the same software interface.         RELEVANCE: Currently, clinicians and bench biologists typically depend on external collaborators for data analysis. The proposed system will provide these scientists with data analysis and visualization methods that are both powerful and easy to use. This will accelerate research in the understanding and treatment of cancer, the second-leading cause of death in the U.S.              ","Cloud Based Resource for Data Hosting, Visualization and Analysis Using UCSC Canc",8735909,U24CA180951,"['neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Environment ', ' Genome ', ' Methods ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Science ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' synapse ', ' Synaptic ', ' Synapses ', ' Technology ', ' Work ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Ecological Systems ', ' Ecologic Systems ', ' Ecosystem ', ' Visualization ', ' Imagery ', ' Clinical ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Galaxy ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Source ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' empowered ', ' secondary cancer ', ' Secondary Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Secondary Malignancy (After Treatment of Primary Cancer) ', ' Secondary Malignancy ', ' Second Cancer ', ' Second Primary Cancers ', ' Sampling ', ' repository ', ' Genomics ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer therapy ', ' text mining ', ' literature searching ', ' literature mining ', ' discovery mining ', ' text searching ', ' Institution ', ' Data ', ' Collection ', ' Slice ', ' Update ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' oncogenomics ', ' cancer genomics ', ' cancer genome ', ' virtual ', ' data integration ', ' grid computing ', ' distributed computing ', ' datagrid ', ' data grid ', ' computational grid ', ' cluster computing ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Coupled ', ' large-scale data base ', ' large-scale database ', ' web interface ', ' sharing data ', ' federated database ', ' federated data ', ' federated computing ', ' TCGA ', ' The Cancer Genome Atlas ', ' data hosting ', ' cloud based ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ,U24,2014,674379,CA-20,0.03463301236792748
"NRI: An Egocentric Computer Vision based Active Learning Co-Robot Wheelchair     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The aim of this proposal is to conduct research on the foundational models and algorithms in computer vision and machine learning for an egocentric vision based active learning co-robot wheelchair system to improve the quality of life of elders and disabled who have limited hand functionality or no hand functionality at all, and rely on wheelchairs for mobility. In this co-robt system, the wheelchair users wear a pair of egocentric camera glasses, i.e., the camera is capturing the users' field-of-the-views. This project help reduce the patients' reliance on care-givers. It fits NINR's mission in addressing key issues raised by the Nation's aging population and shortages of healthcare workforces, and in supporting patient-focused research that encourage and enable individuals to become guardians of their own well-beings.  The egocentric camera serves two purposes. On one hand, from vision based motion sensing, the system can capture unique head motion patterns of the users to control the robot wheelchair in a noninvasive way. Secondly, it serves as a unique environment aware vision sensor for the co-robot system as the user will naturally respond to the surroundings by turning their focus of attention, either consciously or subconsciously. Based on the inputs from the egocentric vision sensor and other on-board robotic sensors, an online learning reservoir computing network is exploited, which not only enables the robotic wheelchair system to actively solicit controls from the users when uncertainty is too high for autonomous operation, but also facilitates the robotic wheelchair system to learn from the solicited user controls. This way, the closed- loop co-robot wheelchair system will evolve and be more capable of handling more complicated environment overtime.  The aims ofthe project include: 1) develop an method to harness egocentric computer vision-based sensing of head movements as an alternative method for wheelchair control; 2) develop a method leveraging visual motion from the egocentric camera for category independent moving obstacle detection; and 3) close the loop of the active learning co-robot wheelchair system through uncertainty based active online learning.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:          The project will improve the quality of life of those elders and disabled who rely on wheelchairs for mobility, and reduce their reliance on care-givers. It builds an intelligent wheelchair robot system that can adapt itself to the personalized behavior of the user.

"Micromachined microphones with in-plane and out-of-plane directivity  Project Summary We aim to introduce to the hearing-assistive device industry the first commercialized microphone that combines all three axes of acoustic pressure gradient onto a single silicon chip. We expect the technology to empower the signal-processing community with a new tool which, when used in conjunction with a conventional omnidirectional microphone, will facilitate new features like ultra-sharp directionality adaptable in real-time by the user and/or artificial intelligence algorithms which scan for desired inputs while filtering out unwanted noise. Directional sensing and the ability to filter out undesirable background acoustic noise are important for those with hearing impairments. Hearing impairment is associated with a loss of fidelity to quiet sounds, while the threshold of pain remains the same. As such, hearing impairment causes a loss of dynamic range or ""window"" of detectable sound amplitudes. Directional sensing enables preferentially amplifying desired sounds without amplifying background noise. As the first step, we aim to accelerate the commercialization of recently introduced biologically- inspired ""rocking"" style microphones by synthesizing these designs with integrated, robust piezoelectric readout which is ideal for addressing the low-power, small-size, and high levels of integration required of the hearing-aid industry. Previous work in this field using laboratory prototypes and optical readout have demonstrated the merits of the biologically-inspired sensing approach (i.e. a simultaneous 20-dB SNR improvement and 10x reduction size improvement beyond what is achievable with present-day hearing-aid or MEMS microphones). By synthesizing a piezoelectric embodiment as an alternative to optical readout, we aim to accelerate through many of the commercialization challenges so that an impact to the hearing device industry can be made. Further, the proposed readout is better adapted towards integrating multiple microphones in the same silicon chip. In Phase II, we aim to integrate a microphone with both in-plane axis of directivity with an out-of-plane directional design to form a complete 3-axis pressure gradient sensor. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Studies show that today 2% of Americans wear a hearing aid, whereas at least 10% of Americans could benefit from a hearing assistive device. The major reason for this gap is patient dissatisfaction. Hearing-aid wearers suffer from what is known as the ""cocktail party"" effect. When the gain is turned up to hear the person speaking across from you, noises in the background are equally amplified - making every scenario sound like a cocktail party. This research aims to make a positive, long-term improvement to hearing-aid patient satisfaction by making commercially available directional microphones with high fidelity.            ",Micromachined microphones with in-plane and out-of-plane directivity,8648777,R43DC013746,"['Acoustic ', ' Acoustics ', ' Algorithms ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Communities ', ' Environment ', ' Goals ', ' sound perception ', ' hearing perception ', ' Hearing ', ' Hearing Aids ', ' Industry ', ' Laboratories ', ' Persons ', ' Noise ', ' optical ', ' Optics ', ' Patient Satisfaction ', ' Client satisfaction ', ' Patients ', ' pressure ', ' Research ', ' assistive device ', ' Assistive Technology ', ' Self-Help Devices ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Si element ', ' Silicon ', ' sound ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' pain tolerance ', ' Pain Tolerance Level ', ' Pain Threshold ', ' sensor ', ' Phase ', ' tool ', ' Investigation ', ' Scanning ', ' Techniques ', ' empowered ', ' American ', ' Structure ', ' Devices ', ' Hypoacusis ', ' Hypoacuses ', ' Hearing Loss ', ' hearing impairment ', ' Address ', ' Microfabrication ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' SBIRS (R43/44) ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' prototype ', ' commercialization ', ' public health relevance ', ' signal processing ', ' ']",NIDCD,"SILICON AUDIO, INC.",R43,2014,149828,TX-35,0.006291054131386427
"Building an open-source cloud-based computational platform to improve data access   We propose to develop a novel, cost-effective, cloud-based data and analytics platform that will provide efficient data storage solutions and enhanced analytics, annotation and reporting capabilities for supporting and accelerating clinical and molecular research in the treatment of substance use disorders (SUD). This open source platform, which leverages existing BioDX technology, will provide a centralized, multi-user environment that enables and encourages collaborative research and information dissemination among team members.  One of the unmet infrastructural challenges of modern molecular research is the availability of computational platforms that allow the management of large databases, easy access to data, the availability of powerful customizable tools for data mining, analysis and visualization, and integration of different data sources to allow successful analysis of complex data problems. Such problems are commonplace in high- throughput molecular research. This proposal aims to fill this gap by developing a robust platform that integrates state-of-the-art open-source technologies for data storage, data access, data mining and analysis, annotation, visualization and reporting.  We previously developed a cloud-based BioDatomics platform for Next Generation Sequencing (NGS), BioDX, which has been successful and has been used commercially by several clients. This proposal aims to develop a new platform leveraging our experience with the BioDX platform that integrates: data storage and real-time data querying using Cloudera Impala; powerful and customizable analytics tools using R and its derivative Bioconductor suite of programs for bioinformatics; annotation integration and reporting which is an existing feature of BioDX; and a visual programming interface that will simplify and enhance the development and maintenance of reproducible analytics workflows. We believe this powerful integrated data platform, if successful, will enable real-time collaboration, dramatically reduce data repository costs, and increase the efficiency and efficacy of data analyses for translating experimental data into actionable research products.  We are committed to analyzing stakeholder needs and optimizing hardware, software and information technology systems to meet their demands. This platform will enhance stakeholder capabilities for developing, implementing and testing various models for substance addiction, risky behavior, discovery of molecular targets for treatment, genomic profiling of patients and other relevant scientific questions. Users will have access to modern statistical, machine learning, data mining and visualization tools.  The initial phase of work will involve development of the platform, optimizing performance on the cloud and testing the integration of new technology. BioDatomics is committed to funding the next phase of work which will include usability testing and finalizing a commercial product, following which full commercialization will proceed. Preliminary commercialization plans have demonstrated that the project has the capacity to generate a million dollars in revenue during the first full year after commercial release.  The ultimate beneficiaries of this platform will be government agencies, academic researchers and pharmaceutical companies pursuing collaborative projects to discover treatments for substance abuse disorders.

"SLASH: SCALABLE LARGE ANALYTIC SEGMENTATION HYBRID DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Advanced instrumentation and cellular imaging techniques using high-throughput 3D electron microscopy are driving a new revolution in the exploration of complex biological systems by providing near seamless views across multiple scales of resolution. These datasets provide the necessary breadth and depth to analyze multicellular, cellular, and subcelluar structure across large swathes of neural tissue. While these new imaging procedures are generating extremely large datasets of enormous value, the quantities are such that no single user or even laboratory team can possibly analyze the full content of their own imaging activities through traditional means. To address this challenge, we propose to further develop and refine a prototype hybrid system for high-throughput segmentation of large neuropil datasets that: 1) advances automatic algorithms for segmentation of cellular and sub-cellular structures using machine learning techniques; 2) couples these techniques to a scalable and flexible process or tool suite allowing multiple users to simultaneously review, edit and curate the results of these automatic approaches; and, 3) builds a knowledge base of training data guiding and improving automated processing. This system will allow project scientists to select areas of interest, execute automatic segmentation algorithms, and distribute workload, curate data, and deposit final results into the Cell Centered Database (Martone et al. 2008) via accessible web-interfaces. Emerging techniques in cellular and subcellular 3D imaging are generating datasets of enormous value to the study of disease processes and to the pursuit of greater insight into the structure and function of the nervous system. To unlock the potential of these data, new solutions are needed to improve the capability to segment and label the individual molecular, subcellular and cellular components within very large volumetric expanses. To address this challenge, we propose a hybrid system for high-throughput segmentation of large neuropil datasets that advances machine learning algorithms for automatic segmentation and couples these techniques to a scalable tool suite for multiple users to simultaneously review, edit and curate results.",SLASH: SCALABLE LARGE ANALYTIC SEGMENTATION HYBRID,8653848,R01NS075314,"['Adoption ', ' Algorithms ', ' driving ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' plasmalemma ', ' Plasma Membrane ', ' Cytoplasmic Membrane ', ' Cell membrane ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cells ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Computers ', ' Couples ', ' intracellular skeleton ', ' Cytoskeletal System ', ' Cellular Matrix ', ' Cytoskeleton ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Negatrons ', ' Negative Beta Particle ', ' Electrons ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Hybrids ', ' Institutes ', ' Laboratories ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Electron Microscopy ', ' Microscopy, Electron, Scanning ', ' mitochondrial ', ' Mitochondria ', ' Names ', ' Neurologic Organ System ', ' Neurologic Body System ', ' Nervous System ', ' Nervous system structure ', ' nervous system function ', ' Neurological function ', ' Neurologic function ', ' Nervous System Physiology ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' Organelles ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Solutions ', ' Stains ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' tomography ', ' Universities ', ' Utah ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Work Load ', ' Workload ', ' tangle ', ' neurofibrillary pathology ', ' neurofibrillary lesion ', ' neurofibrillary degeneration ', ' Neurofibrillary Tangles ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' image processing ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Microscopic ', ' Biological ', ' Training ', ' Neuropil ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Cell Structure ', ' Cell Components ', ' Cellular Structures ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' Deposit ', ' Deposition ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Stainings ', ' Staining method ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' computer imaging ', ' digital imaging ', ' electron optics ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Devices ', ' Intracellular Structure ', ' Subcellular structure ', ' Three Dimensional Medical Imaging ', ' 3D imaging ', ' 3-D Imaging ', ' Three-Dimensional Imaging ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Target ', ' Resolution ', ' Computer Instrumentation ', ' Advanced Instrumentation ', ' Computers and Advanced Instrumentation ', ' Validation ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' cell imaging ', ' cellular imaging ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' web interface ', ' scientific computing ', ' prototype ', ' biological systems ', ' complex biological systems ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' ']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2014,436094,CA-52,0.018230483238334157
"Sensor Activity Monitoring, Feedback, and Outcome Measures, Stroke Rehabilitation     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ""Technologies for Healthy Independent Living"" coincides with our goal to test and further develop inexpensive wireless sensors with communication and analysis platforms to monitor everyday activities, such as walking and exercise, in disabled persons. Our Medical Daily Activity Wireless Network (MDAWN) aims to enable researchers, trialists, and clinicians to acquire reliable data about daily physical activites in the home and community, rather than only during clinic and laboratory visits or by questionnaires. Novel machine-learning algorithms developed for each person from ankle accelerometers will identify the type, quantity and quality of exercise and walking on a continuous basis. In addition, we will test an inexpensive, instrumented, ergometric pedaler designed for disabled persons, called the UCFit, to promote home-based fitness exercise. The MDAWN and UFCFit sensors send data to an Android smartphone, then over the Internet to a UCLA server for analysis. We will nest further evaluation of the utility of these remote sensing devices within the real-world setting of a clinical trial of patients with recent disabling stroke,for whom formal rehabilitation often falls short of enabling functional walking and cardiovascular fitness. In a phase 2, randomized controlled trial, we will compare two levels of weekly telephonic feedback about daily performance, made possible for the first time by remote data acquisition. The high feedback group will receive everyday performance data that includes the number of bouts and minutes of pedaling plus rate/RPMs and forces used, as well as the number of bouts of walking, duration, and average speed and distance used in home and community. The minimal feedback group only hears about total daily UCFit exercise and walking time. After 4 months of encouraging up to four 30-min sessions per week of UCFit exercise, we will test for a 50% between-group difference in amount of daily exercise and walking time. Secondary outcomes examine change in level of fitness, walking speed, and physical functioning. The two groups then cross over to high or low feedback for 4 more months, before outcomes are reassessed. Then, no feedback is given and participants are tested for amount of exercise and fitness at 12 months. We will determine which form of feedback motivates better self-management to optimize fitness and walking. We will gather unique data about mobility in the transition from rehabilitation hospital to home; quantify gait training durin usual care; assess walking skills under more complex conditions than in a laboratory; and test the responsiveness of sensor data as a ratio scale outcome measurement during a time of expected gains. This study will be the first comprehensive demonstration of mHealth remote monitoring and outcome measures of daily physical activity!          Several important public health needs will be met by testing, within a clinical trial in the home and community, a system of wearable activity and exercise monitoring technologies that measure the type, quantity and quality of walking and exercise. Our trial aims to increase fitness and enable more functional levels of daily activities in disable persons after stroke, while providing a proof-of-principle for the utility of wireless health toolsto reliably monitor real-world physical functioning and to provide clinically meaningful outcome measures. These generic tools for daily care and research can be deployed across diseases and disabilities.

"Development of a Centralized Intelligence and Control AP Hub Device ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Despite major advances in pharmaceuticals and medical device technology, the ability to safely and effectively control blood glucose in patients with Type 1 diabetes has remained a recalcitrant challenge and a significant source of human suffering and economic cost. With the advent of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), increasing effort has been focused on the development of artificial pancreas (AP) systems using CGM coupled with insulin pump via closed-loop control (CLC) algorithms. Integration of these disparate technologies and implementation in a commercial product has faced numerous challenges to date. TypeZero Technologies' objective is the commercialization of the robust and extensively tested Diabetes Assistant (DiAs) software platform and supporting technology into a commercial-grade device ""hub"" designed to organize and control a network of medical devices for the improved management of blood glucose in the context of Type 1 diabetes. The DiAs prototype has been extensively tested to date, and has generated over 24,000 hours of on- patient data. In numerous clinical trials, this technology has reduced dramatically the frequency of occurrence of severe hyper- and hypoglycemic events, reduced glycemic variability and improved patient's ""time-in-range"" (rate of euglycemia). DiAs and supporting technologies represent the core elements of a radically different treatment paradigm that integrates and maximizes the capabilities of existing and currently approved medical devices with a proprietary software platform and control technologies. The key characteristics of the TypeZero hub are:  "" Modular hub functionality residing optionally within and across available networked devices including the  patient's pump, meter, CGM, smartphone, or within cloud services;  "" Ability to accommodate any control strategy that is deemed optimal for a specific patient;  "" Inherently layered architecture, designed with an upward pathway of sequential module deployment;  "" Inherent safety, featuring a downward pathway of graceful degradation to a known system state in the  event of component failure; and  "" Local and Global modes of operation enabling the availability of certain processes and patient  interaction through the portable device; other services and remote monitoring of subject and system  state are available via telecommunication (e.g. 3G, WiFi, etc.). We envision that in the near future consumer electronics hardware equipped with appropriate software (e.g. DiAs) would gradually replace specialized CGM receivers or insulin pump controllers, merging into a single ultra-portable platform the functions of continuous monitoring, insulin delivery, and closed-loop control. In the near-term, we envision creating a dedicated hub controller that will host key functionalities of artificial pancreas as a critical step toward the future.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The persistent challenge of safely and effectively managing blood glucose levels in the context of Type 1 diabetes indicates the inadequacy of currently approved and available medical device technologies. Artificial pancreas approaches to algorithm-based control of medical devices for improved patient safety and outcomes has been an active area of research for many years. TypeZero Technologies seeks to commercialize a proprietary suite of technologies that have been developed and extensively tested in clinical trial settings and shown to deliver significant improvements in safety and efficacy. The successful development of TypeZero's hub device will represent a novel integration of capabilities that will dramatically accelerate the commercial availability of artificial pancreas technologies.        ",Development of a Centralized Intelligence and Control AP Hub Device,8823176,R43DK104293,"['Algorithms ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Architecture ', ' Blood Sugar ', ' Blood Glucose ', ' Carbohydrates ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communication ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type I diabetes ', ' ketosis prone diabetes ', ' juvenile diabetes mellitus ', ' juvenile diabetes ', ' insulin dependent diabetes ', ' Type I Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 1 diabetes ', ' Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T1DM ', ' T1D ', ' T1 diabetes ', ' T1 DM ', ' Sudden-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Prone Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Juvenile-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' IDDM ', ' Brittle Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Electronics ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Physical Exercise ', ' Exercise ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' hyperglycemic ', ' Hyperglycemia ', ' hypoglycemic episodes ', ' hypoglycemic ', ' Hypoglycemia ', ' Incidence ', ' Regular Insulin ', ' Novolin R ', ' Insulin (ox), 8A-L-threonine-10A-L-isoleucine-30B-L-threonine- ', ' Humulin R ', ' Insulin ', ' insulin pump ', ' Insulin Infusion Systems ', ' Intelligence ', ' Judgment ', ' Medical Device ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolism ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacokinetics ', ' Drug Kinetics ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Renal Insufficiency ', ' Renal Failure ', ' Kidney Insufficiency ', ' Kidney Failure ', ' Research ', ' retinopathy ', ' retina disorder ', ' retina disease ', ' Retinal Disorder ', ' Retinal Diseases ', ' Running ', ' Safety ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Solutions ', ' Supervision ', ' Technology ', ' Telecommunications ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Virginia ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' Caring ', ' Telemedicine ', ' base ', ' Pump ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Licensing ', ' Replacement Therapy ', ' phase II trial ', ' phase II protocol ', ' phase 2 trial ', ' Phase 2 Clinical Trials ', ' Phase II Clinical Trials ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Contracts ', ' Artificial Pancreas ', ' Diagnostic ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Hour ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' neuropathic ', ' Neuropathy ', ' subcutaneous ', ' Continuous Infusion ', ' Source ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' meter ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' monitoring device ', ' United States Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ', ' Public Law 104-191 ', ' PL104-191 ', ' PL 104-191 ', ' Kennedy Kassebaum Act ', ' HIPAA ', ' Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ', ' novel ', ' economic cost ', ' transition metal ', ' Transition Elements ', ' Devices ', ' Modeling ', ' glucose meter ', ' glucose monitor ', ' glucose sensor ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' Manufacturer ', ' Manufacturer Name ', ' patient safety ', ' Provider ', ' Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' Data ', ' Exogenous Factors ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' SBIRS (R43/44) ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' wireless ', ' Wireless Technology ', ' Monitor ', ' Preparation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' glycemic control ', ' Outcome ', ' Coupled ', ' graphic user interface ', ' Graphical interface ', ' graphical user interface ', ' prototype ', ' commercialization ', ' public health relevance ', ' safety testing ', ' middleware ', ' Secure ', ' operation ', ' cloud based ', ' ']",NIDDK,"TYPEZERO TECHNOLOGIES, LLC",R43,2014,224354,VA-05,-0.011426701217828537
"Coding of auditory space in the avian brain    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): All auditory information used for sound localization ascends through the brainstem auditory nuclei. We will use physiological and theoretical approaches to understand how multidimensional features of sound, relevant to sound localization, are processed and encoded in the avian auditory brainstem. A primary advantage of using barn owls for the exploration of auditory processing is the substantial body of behavioral, anatomical and neurophysiological work that has elucidated the mechanisms of sound localization. The main cues owls use to compute sound direction are the interaural level difference (ILD) and the interaural time difference (ITD). Unlike mammals, owls use ILD to determine the vertical coordinate of the sound source and ITD to determine the horizontal coordinate. Two independent brainstem pathways process ITD and ILD and converge in the midbrain, where a spatiotopic map of auditory space emerges. Activity of neurons in the map precedes, and stimulation evokes, a head-orienting response towards the sound source. Thus, in barn owls, the neural algorithm for sound localization can be viewed as a system in which two input variables (ITD and ILD) are processed in parallel in order to control two output variables (horizontal and vertical coordinates of head saccades). We have used theoretical models to describe the neural responses that encode spatial information in the owl's auditory system. This approach has guided our experiments and aided the interpretation of our findings. Behavioral experiments in humans have used a similar approach to sound localization. However, due to a lack of neural data in humans, the predictive power of models of sound localization with regard to the neural bases of behavior has been a persistent question. Our studies in barn owls address this issue by investigating the mechanism of neural computations that are fundamental to models developed for human sound localization. This proposal is organized around three primary questions: 1) What are the computational primitives of auditory-space processing in the owl's brainstem? 2) How is spectrotemporal information encoded, transmitted and processed in parallel with spatial information? 3) What fundamental changes in information coding occur at the crossroads between the auditory midbrain and forebrain? We will address these questions using a wide range of strategies and techniques - intracellular in vivo recordings, cell-attached recording in vivo, multi-neuron tetrode recording, and modeling - which will make our approach interdisciplinary and of broad scope. Our research seeks to understand the function of the auditory brainstem and midbrain. In doing so, we will identify the types of information that are available to upstream nuclei and show how this information is encoded. A comprehensive approach to information processing in the auditory brainstem has the potential to provide new avenues for better understanding disorders of the central auditory system and cognitive impairments involving hearing. By linking biology and engineering, mathematical formulations of brain processes can advance technology related to robotics and neural prosthetics. Cochlear implants that provide encoding of stimuli in ways that are more biologically relevant can be built, while devices acting downstream of the cochlea could aid patients with compromised or non-functional auditory nerves. By its differences and similarities with other species, the avian brain provides an excellent model system to define fundamental properties of neural processing and neural coding.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research will test hypotheses based on human models, of how the auditory system computes sound direction. This approach has the potential of providing new avenues for better understanding disorders of the central auditory system and cognitive impairments involving hearing. By linking biology and engineering, mathematical formulations of brain processes can advance technology related to artificial intelligence and neural prosthetics; smarter cochlear implants can be built, as well as devices acting downstream of the cochlea could aid patients with compromised or non-functional auditory nerves.

"New Computational Methods for Data-driven Protein Structure Prediction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proteins play a central role in all biological processes. Akin to the complete sequencing of genomes, complete description of protein structures is a fundamental step towards understanding biological life, and is also highly relevant medically in the development of therapeutics and drugs. The broad, long-term goal of the project is to develop machine learning methods for data-driven protein structure prediction through two independent but complementary strategies: 1) much more accurate template-based modeling for proteins with remote homologs in the Protein Data Bank and 2) better template-free modeling method for proteins without detectable templates and for improving template-based models. The specific aims are: Aim 1) to greatly improve template-based modeling by 1a) improving protein sequence-template alignment using a regression-tree-based nonlinear scoring function, especially when good sequence profiles are unavailable; and 1b) improving fold recognition using a machine learning method to combine both residue-level and atom-level features; Aim 2) to improve protein conformation sampling in a continuous space and thus template-free modeling by three independent but complementary approaches: 2a) modeling nonlinear sequence- structure relationship using Conditional (Markov) Random Fields (CRF) models; 2b) simultaneously sampling secondary and tertiary structure; and 2c) learning structure information from template. The core of the project is to develop various CRF models for data-driven protein structure prediction, by learning protein sequence-structure relationship from existing sequence/structure databases. The product of this research includes a regression-tree-based CRF model for accurate protein alignment, especially for proteins without close homologs in the PDB or without very good sequence profiles; a SVM model for protein fold recognition; a few CRF models for efficient protein conformation sampling in a continuous space; and a complete protein structure prediction software package. Also, it will produce a web server publicly available for various academic and biomedical users. Protein structure prediction will lead to a broad range of biomedical applications, such as the development of novel diagnostics, better understanding of disease processes and improved preventive therapies leading to reduced health care costs.

"Artificial Intelligence in a Mobile Intervention for Depression (AIM)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary aim of this proposal is to develop and evaluate the use of state of the art machine learning approaches within a mobile intervention application for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). Machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, focuses on the development of algorithms that automatically improve and evolve based on collected data. Machine learning models can learn to detect complex, latent patterns in data and apply such knowledge to decision making in real time. The proposed intervention, called IntelliCare, will use ongoing data collected from the patient and intervention application to continuously adapt intervention content, content form, and motivational messaging to create a highly tailored and user-responsive treatment system. Behavioral intervention technologies (BITs), including web-based and mobile interventions, have been developed and are increasingly being used to treat MDD. BITs are moderately effective in treating depression, particularly when guided by human coaching via email or telephone. However, lack of personalization and inability to adapt to patient needs or preferences, which results in a perceived lack of relevance, contributes to poorer adherence and outcomes. IntelliCare will be designed as a mobile application, but will be accessible via computer web browsers and tablets. The IntelliCare machine learning framework will use individual data obtained from use data (e.g., length of time using a treatment component), embedded sensors in the phone (e.g., GPS), and the user's self-reports (e.g., ""like"" and usefulness ratings of treatment components) to provide a highly tailored intervention that can learn from the patient and adapt intervention and motivational materials to the patient's preferences and state. Low intensity coaching will serve as a backstop to support adherence. This project will contain three phases.  Phase 1 will involve the development of IntelliCare and its optimization through usability testing.  Phase 2 will be a field trial of 200 users who will receive IntelliCare for 12 weeks. The field trial has two aims: first to complete usability testing and optimization of the treatment framework, and second to develop the machine learning models and algorithms. Phase 3 will subject IntelliCare to a double blind, randomized controlled trial, comparing it to MobilCare. MobilCare will be identical to IntelliCare except that it will use standard presentation and presentation, rather than machine learning, to provide treatment and motivational materials. We will recruit half the participants from primary care settings, as this is the de facto site for treatment of depression in the United States, and half through the Internet, which is the main portal to health apps. The application of adaptive machine learning analytics to a mobile intervention has the potential to create a new generation of BITs that could revolutionize the way that such interventions are conceptualized, designed, and deployed. These innovations would have broad consequences and could be extended a broader range of BITS, including web- based interventions, and to other interventions targeting a wide range of health and mental health problems.

"Noninvasive Assessment of Neuromuscular Disease using Electrical Impedance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The neuromuscular disorders include a wide group of conditions ranging from relatively mild focal problems, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, to severe, generalized diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Current methods for evaluating these disorders remain limited to a variety of tests and procedures that are either invasive or remarkably qualitative in nature. One newer technique, electrical impedance myography (EIM), offers the prospect of obtaining quantitative data on muscle condition painlessly and non-invasively. However, no commercial devices specifically tailored for EIM use exist, with nearly all previous EIM work relying upon off-the-shelf bioimpedance devices designed for ""whole-body"" rather than single-muscle assessment. In Phase 1 of this SBIR, Convergence Medical Devices, Inc (CMD) developed an initial prototype system to test proof-of-principle innovative concepts in circuit design and data acquisition to provide highly sensitive and accurate data at an extended frequency range (out to 10 MHz) and over multiple angles relative to the major muscle fiber direction. This work was followed by supplemental work that produced the first hand-held device with robust electronics capable of similar measurements with a detachable, interchangeable electrode array. In this 3-year Phase 2 SBIR, CMD proposes to further refine that technology so as to assist in disease diagnosis and for following disease progression, with a specific focus on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In Aim 1 of the proposed grant, testing of multiple electrode array designs will be performed on a group of normal subjects and those with ALS to determine which electrode array designs offer the greatest reproducibility and ability to discriminate healthy from diseased individuals. In Aim 2, the device and the 3 ""best"" array designs identified in Aim 1 will be tested in 30 ALS patients, 30 patients with syndromes mimicking ALS (e.g., polyradiculopathy and motor-predominant neuropathy), and 30 subjects with suspected/possible ALS to determine the single best array design for diagnosis and to determine its sensitivity and specificity. This study will take place at CMD and four external sites and will be managed by the Northeast ALS trials Consortium (NEALS), the premier organization for overseeing clinical trials in ALS. In Aim 3, the 30 suspected/possible ALS patients recruited in SA2 and 30 additional suspected/possible ALS patients will be assessed monthly using EIM and the 3 arrays identified in SA1. All subjects will also undergo standard measurements of disease progression including handheld dynamometry, ALS Functional Rating Scale, and spirometry. The best array design for assessing disease progression will be identified and compared to conventional markers of disease progression to determine EIM's sensitivity to disease status. Thus, at the conclusion of this research program, we anticipate having developed and vigorously tested an EIM device and associated electrode designs that together will serve as a powerful new diagnostic and monitoring tool for neuromuscular disease.          The neuromuscular disorders are a group of conditions that impact the lives of millions of people in the United States alone. In this study, Convergence Medical Devices, in collaboration with neurologists at several medical centers, will develop and test a new device based on the concept of electrical impedance myography, a technique that offers the promise of rapid and accurate disease assessment. With the completion of this study, a new, painless tool will be developed and studied that will assist in individual patient care and will speed drug testing in clinical trials in diseases ranging from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and muscular dystrophy to radiculopathy and polyneuropathy.

"Head-mounted Activity Monitoring(HAM)System Fast Track  ABSTRACT The population of the United States, as in most developed nations, is aging and is doing so at an increasing rate. This change in demographics is having a dramatic affect on the nation's healthcare delivery system and the related public costs. The Congressional Budget Office predicts that the cost of long-term care for the elderly will reach $207 billion in 2020 and $346 billion in 2040. By 2030, spending for Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid will amount to almost 60% of the federal budget. The strong predilection of most of the elderly, and their families, is to prefer long-term care delivery in the home rather than in the institutionalized setting. This has resulted in a massive shift of elderly care costs to unpaid family caregivers, and this cost is not reflected in the budget numbers provided above. However, the continuation of this shifting of elderly care costs to family members is not sustainable due to the decrease in birth rate and the increasing number of adults surviving to old age without living children. As a result there will be an increasingly urgent need for publicly funded support of elderly home-based care while, at the same time, an equally urgent need to control the spirally cost of this care. More efficient delivery of home-care services for the elderly can have a significant impact on controlling, or even reducing, the cost of long-term elderly care. However, in order to deliver this care cost-effectively, a technology-based infrastructure optimized for this purpose will be required. One means of achieving this goal is by developing innovative mobile technology solutions which can monitor and maintain the activity, health and safety, and thereby the independence, of the elderly within the home. Our working hypothesis in this proposal is that a properly designed, head-mounted, wearable-computing solution can bring unique and powerful capabilities to address the need for more effective and lower-cost elderly home monitoring. We propose to develop a highly compact, light-weight, innovative technology called the Head-mounted Activity Monitoring (HAM) System. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project proposes to develop an innovative, low cost, ubiquitous and easy to use hardware and software system designed to support the independent living of the elderly. This wearable computing system accomplishes this by facilitating remote activity and safety monitoring, and also supports communication and interaction between the elderly, their caregivers, friends and family members, thereby reducing social isolation.            ",Head-mounted Activity Monitoring(HAM)System Fast Track,8647170,R44AG046969,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' Americas ', ' Behavior ', ' Birth Rate ', ' Breeding ', ' Budgets ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communication ', ' computing system ', ' Computer Systems ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' Health Sciences, Allied and Health Services Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' Ear ', ' Ear structure ', ' Electronics ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Spectacles ', ' Eyeglasses ', ' Family ', ' Feedback ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Hand ', ' Head ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' home health care ', ' Domiciliary Care ', ' Home Care Services ', ' home for elderly ', ' Old Age Homes ', ' Home for seniors ', ' Homes for the Aged ', ' Housing ', ' Independent Living ', ' Locomotion ', ' extended care ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' Memory ', ' Patents ', ' Legal patent ', ' Research ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' research and development ', ' Running ', ' Safety ', ' Social isolation ', ' Social Insurance ', ' Social Security ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Solutions ', ' Technology ', ' Telecommunications ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Friends ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' Family Care Giver ', ' Family Caregiver ', ' Family member ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Nexus Junction ', ' Nexus ', ' Low-resistance Junction ', ' Communicating Junction ', ' Gap Junctions ', ' Evaluation ', ' Funding ', ' Industrialized Nations ', ' Industrialized Countries ', ' Developed Nations ', ' Developed Nation ', ' Developed Country ', ' Developed Countries ', ' light (weight) ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' innovative technologies ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' Performance ', ' care delivery ', ' Agreement ', ' Devices ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Long-Term Care for Elderly ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cost ', ' software systems ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' mobile device ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' usability ', ' demographics ', ' prototype ', ' commercialization ', ' public health relevance ', ' Secure ', ' arm ', ' three dimensional printing ', ' 3D printer ', ' 3-D printer ', ' 3-D print ', ' 3D Print ', ' Wearable Computing ', ' Wearable Computer ', ' ']",NIA,"GEN-9, INC.",R44,2014,222981,CA-18,-0.011627231886698034
"Individualized Signal Processing Strategy to Reduce Hearing Health Care Cost/Disp  This project describes a novel approach to automate and individualize the signal processing strategy for hearing aids that can result in improved speech intelligibility in background noise, greater user satisfaction and acceptance for hearing aids, and reduce barriers to affordable hearing health care. The proposed Individualized Signal Processing Strategy (ISPS) is based upon individual performance on categorical perception tasks for speech stimuli. This differs from traditional methods based on sophisticated gain models built upon average perception, performance, and preference data. The ability to determine one's ISPS automatically, rapidly and remotely results in dramatic cost-savings and greater accessibility to hearing health care for patients who cannot afford it or for those who lack easy access to the necessary expertise. These technical achievements have the potential to radically change the hearing aid sales and delivery models yet can also be implemented within existing business models by replacing contemporary hearing aid fitting methods (e.g. adjusting to gain-frequency targets followed by subjective fine tuning) with individualized speech-based parameter adjustment. Successful implementation of the ISPS technology will impact several barriers identified in RFA-DC-12-004 including physical, infrastructure and knowledge barriers (by allowing remote or self-fitting hearing aids and minimizing the need for highly skilled expertise), economic barriers (by reducing overall costs) and cultural barriers (by providing easy access to hearing aid fitting for patients who tend to avoid seeking professional help). This Phase I project will demonstrate the feasibility for the ISPS approach by (1) implementing the ISPS on a standard personal computer, (2) integrating the ISPS with a commercially available hearing aid, and (3) completing a pilot clinical study comparing outcomes with ISPS fitting to those achieved with traditional prescriptive gain fitting within the same subjects. Following successful demonstration of these objectives, a Phase II project will be proposed to enable extension of the technology to a wide range of hearing aids, patient characteristics and listening environments, including innovations supporting the use for remote and self-fitting applications. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project seeks to develop, implement and test a novel approach for fitting hearing aids using an individual's speech perception abilities. This automated approach can improved listener performance while significant reducing costs of hearing health care. The automation of the fitting procedure can dramatically increase accessibility of hearing health care.                ",Individualized Signal Processing Strategy to Reduce Hearing Health Care Cost/Disp,8626066,R43DC013623,"['Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' Acoustic ', ' Acoustics ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Audiology ', ' Automation ', ' Canada ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Cochlear Prosthesis ', ' Auditory Prosthesis ', ' Cochlear Implants ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Goals ', ' sound perception ', ' hearing perception ', ' Hearing ', ' Hearing Aids ', ' indwelling device ', ' implant device ', ' biomedical implant ', ' implantable device ', ' Learning ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Research ', ' Sales ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Solutions ', ' sound ', ' Speech ', ' Speech Intelligibilities ', ' Speech Intelligibility ', ' Speech Perception ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Cost Savings ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Businesses ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Personal Computers ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Phase ', ' Training ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' satisfaction ', ' Cross-Over Designs ', ' Crossover Design ', ' Letters ', ' instrument ', ' Knowledge ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Pattern ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' novel ', ' Graph ', ' Metric ', ' Devices ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Manufacturer ', ' Manufacturer Name ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Data ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Collection ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' Behavioral ', ' Output ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' public health relevance ', ' signal processing ', ' ']",NIDCD,"SECURBORATION, INC.",R43,2014,149994,FL-08,-0.058948122345652956
"KnowEng, a Scalable Knowledge Engine for Large-Scale Genomic Data-OVERALL     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary goal of the proposed Center of Excellence is to build a powerful and scalable Knowledge Engine for Genomics, KnowEnG. KnowEnG will transform the way biomedical researchers analyze their genome-wide data by integrating multiple analytical methods derived from the most advanced data mining and machine learning research to use the full breadth of existing knowledge about the relationships between genes as background, and providing an intuitive and professionally designed user interface. In order to achieve these goals, the project includes the following components: (1) gathering and integrating existing knowledgebases documenting connections between genes and their functions into a single Knowledge Network; (2) developing computational methods for analyzing genome-wide user datasets in the context of this pre-existing knowledge; (3) implementing these methods into scalable software components that can be deployed in a public or private cloud; (4) designing and implementing a Web-based user interface, based on the HUBZero toolkit, that enables the interactive analysis of user-supplied datasets in a graphics-driven and intuitive fashion; (5) thoroughly testing the functionality and usefulness of the KnowEnG environment in three large scale projects in the clinical sciences (pharmacogenomics of breast cancer), behavioral sciences (identification of gene regulatory modules underlying behavioral patterns) and drug discovery (genome-based prediction of the capacity of microorganisms to synthesize novel biologically active compounds). The KnowEng environment will be deployed in a cloud infrastructure and fully available to the community, as will be the software developed by the Center. The proposed Center is a collaboration between the University of Illinois (UIUC), a recognized world leader in computational science and engineering, and the Mayo Clinic, one of the leading clinical care and research organizations in the worid, and will be based at the UIUC Institute for Genomic Biology, which has state-of-the-art facilities and a nationally recognized program of multidisciplinary team-based genomic research.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Physicians and biologists are now routinely producing very large, genome-wide datasets.

"Context Understanding Technology to improve internet accessibility for users with DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this SBIR project is to develop a new tool to improve the ability of blind and visually impaired people to quickly get to the right web pages, to avoid ending up on the wrong web pages, and to reach the desired part of each web page efficiently. The motivation for this effort is that getting a 'big picture' understanding of a  web page is one of the biggest challenges facing this population of computer users. Existing tools for blind and visually impaired people, such as screen readers and screen magnifiers, present the entire web page serially, in full detail, either by textual output of the details, or b providing a magnified view of a small part of the page. However, if the user is not already familiar with the website, the resulting lack of context requires a laborious and time-consuming process to scan through sometimes hundreds of details before knowing whether anything of interest even exists on the page in question. In contrast, the proposed technology analyzes web pages in a similar way that sighted users quickly scan pages before reading in detail, to provide a succinct, informative guidance on the context and layout of the page, so that a user quickly gains a much richer ""big-picture"" understanding. The proposed Phase II project builds on a successful Phase I user evaluation of a proof- of-concept of the software, in which users expressed a strong preference for the contextual cues provided by the approach. Phase II includes creating a fully-functional prototype of the software tool. Throughout the technology development, feedback from users and practitioners will guide the path of the R&D for maximum usability. At the conclusion of Phase II, an end-user, in-home evaluation study will verify the effectiveness of the tool, providing the starting point for full-scale commercialization. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The R&D in this Phase II SBIR project will result in an improved way to use the Internet for individuals with visual disabilities. The technology will help to overcome the lack of accessibility and high level of frustration currently found among blind and visually impaired users.

"Ancillary Comparative Effectiveness of Atrial Fibrillation Ablation Surgery    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This proposal describes an ancillary study to a recently initiated comparative effectiveness trial ""Surgical Ablation versus No Surgical Ablation for Patients with Persistent or Longstanding Persistent Atrial Fibrillation Undergoing Mitral Valve Surgery"" (NCT00903370), which is part of the NHLBI-sponsored Cardiothoracic Surgery Network (CTSN). Its aims are to perform a time-sensitive substudy of continuous heart rhythm monitoring and to develop and apply novel statistical tools to assess ablation effectiveness in groups of patients. As such, it will provide critical new knowledge to support a secondary objective of the parent trial: to inform rhythm monitoring and analysis strategies for future trials of rhythm control in atrial fibrillation (AF).  Great enthusiasm for innovative tissue-destroying (ablation) procedures to treat AF has led to technology outstripping science. Mechanisms of AF (which afflicts >3 million Americans) remain poorly understood, methods to assess its cure are primitive, and guidelines for analyzing rhythm outcomes are flawed due to lack of appropriate statistical methodology. Why? After ablation procedures, AF may recur in episodes of varying duration. Yet current monitoring consists of ""snapshots"" of semiannual rhythm recording (Holter), or more frequent-but short-transtelephonic monitoring (TTM). Ideally, an implantable monitoring device could detect all these episodes over a patient's lifetime; however, even if this were possible, statistical methods to analyze this series of occurrences in groups of patients for comparative effectiveness of AF therapies or to identify risk factors are poorly developed. Right now a window of opportunity exists to make important strides in more thorough AF assessment and proper data analysis because the CTSN has just launched a randomized trial of surgical AF therapies that includes weekly TTM of atrial rhythm as well as traditional 6- and 12-month Holter assessment. We propose a time-sensitive substudy of implanting an FDA-approved miniature loop recorder to capture AF episodes continuously. These data will be used in the development of a suite of new analytic methods for aggregating data such as these across time and across patients to characterize time course and identify modulating factors. They will then be used to assess the trial's rhythm endpoints and suggest designs for more informative future trials with substantially reduced sample size. We have assembled a team of clinicians and statisticians, including individuals who designed the parent trial, who are experienced in implanting the monitoring device, and who are experts in analytic methods research, to develop and apply novel methods to these several types of rhythm data. We will leverage developments from an intramural NHLBI machine learning program at Cleveland Clinic and State of Ohio-funded Atrial Fibrillation Innovation Center. The analytic methods have wide applicability to the important field of longitudinal data analysis.    A chaotic heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation (AF), which affects more than 3 million Americans, especially the elderly, causes strokes, and commonly accompanies heart valve disease. AF treatments outstrip scientific understanding of the rhythm and how to assess treatment success across time in clinical trials. Thus, the Institute of Medicine has placed trials of AF treatment in the first tier of 100 comparative effectiveness priorities for the nation. An NIH-sponsored trial of surgical treatment of AF is has just been launched, and we propose a substudy of an implanted rhythm monitoring device (Medtronic REVEAL XT) and new methods of AF analysis for groups of patients that will help assess the trial's endpoints and inform future trials. Thus, this ancillary study application proposes to (1) collect, in a subset of patients, more refined rhythm data than proposed in the parent trial, (2) develop generalizable new methods of analysis, and (3) apply these methods to both the data collected through continuous monitoring as well as the follow-up data collected in the parent trial through Holter and trans-telephonic monitoring.

"Continued Development of CellProfiler Cell Image Analysis Software     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Most laboratories studying biological processes and human disease use microscopes to image cells or other biological samples. Even for small-scale experiments, the information sought from images is increasingly quantitative and complex, and automated microscopes collect images faster than can be examined by eye.  We will continue our development of CellProfiler (www.cellprofiler.org) to meet this strong and growing demand for software to analyze biological images. CellProfiler is a versatile, open-source toolbox. Using its point-and-click interface, researchers build a customized workflow of image-analysis modules to identify and measure biological objects in images. It can extract valuable biological information from images quickly, even for high-throughput experiments, while increasing objectivity and statistical power in microscopy experiments.  Published only seven years ago, CellProfiler is already an important and widely used tool: it is launched 100,000+ times per year by users around the world and has been cited in more than 800 papers from 600 distinct laboratories. The software evolves in an intensely collaborative and interdisciplinary research environment with dozens of ongoing projects and has been successfully applied to a wide range of biological samples and assays, from counting cells to scoring complex phenotypes by machine learning.  We propose to improve CellProfiler's capabilities in order to enable further biological imaging research, meet the needs of the growing user base, and expand the community that benefits from CellProfiler:  First, microscopy experiments are rapidly expanding in both scale and scope, and are beginning to push CellProfiler's limits, particularly when they involve larger images (e.g., for tissue samples, cellular microarrays, large field-of-view cameras), multi-dimensional images (time-lapse and three-dimensional imaging), images for morphological profiling, and novel microscopy types (super-resolution and single-molecule imaging). We will upgrade CellProfiler's capabilities to serve these needs and add proven, state-of-the-art algorithms for image processing (especially segmentation and filtering for non-fluorescence images), time-lapse and 3D analysis, and novel microscopy types. We will also add features and usability improvements requested by the large CellProfiler community.  Second, we will enable researchers to create sophisticated bioimaging analysis workflows by expanding CellProfiler's interoperability with complementary software (e.g., MATLAB, ImageJ, MicroManager, KNIME).  Third, we will disseminate CellProfiler and provide user, educator, and developer support. There is great demand for our online forum, downloadable materials, and in-person tutorials (1,000+ attendees so far).  These improvements to the first, and still preeminent, open-source software for modular, high- throughput biological image analysis will enable hundreds of NIH-funded laboratories to make high-impact biological discoveries from microscopy images across all disciplines within biology.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Most laboratories studying biological processes and human disease use microscopy to analyze cells and other samples. We will enable these researchers to rapidly and accurately extract numerical data from microscopy images by continuing to develop and support our popular, user-friendly, open-source image analysis software, CellProfiler (www.cellprofiler.org), to accommodate the increasing scale and scope of modern microscopy experiments.            ",Continued Development of CellProfiler Cell Image Analysis Software,8761195,R01GM089652,"['Algorithms ', ' Award ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biology ', ' Cell Number ', ' Cell Count ', ' Cells ', ' Communities ', ' computer vision ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' Environment ', ' Explosion ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye ', ' Grant ', ' Laboratories ', ' Leadership ', ' Maintenance ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Microscopy ', ' body movement ', ' Movement ', ' Persons ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' living system ', ' Organism ', ' Paper ', ' Phenotype ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Computer Software Engineering ', ' Computer Software Development ', ' Software Engineering ', ' Stains ', ' Teaching ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Measures ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' Microscope ', ' improved ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Biological ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Scanning ', ' Slide ', ' Stainings ', ' Staining method ', ' meetings ', ' Speed ', ' Speed (motion) ', ' novel ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Laboratory Study ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Sampling ', ' biomedical imaging ', ' bioimaging ', ' single molecule ', ' Three Dimensional Medical Imaging ', ' 3D imaging ', ' 3-D Imaging ', ' Three-Dimensional Imaging ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cell imaging ', ' cellular imaging ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' 3D analysis ', ' 3-dimensional analysis ', ' 3-D analysis ', ' Three-dimensional analysis ', ' interoperability ', ' user-friendly ', ' open source ', ' human disease ', ' usability ', ' public health relevance ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' Cloud Infrastructure ', ' Cloud Computing ', ' ']",NIGMS,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",R01,2014,522488,MA-07,0.027607144871263135

"Development of epidermal, wireless sensor tattoos for non-invasive monitoring of biofluid composition ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Non-invasive medical devices are fast emerging as powerful tools in providing quantitative, simple to parse data in assessing the health and wellness of users. These devices can provide information feedback to users on their state of health, and can potentially provide valuable real-time insight to doctors on the links between user consumption and activity on their respective health. Recently described epidermal electronics / multifunctional tattoos introduced from our lab and others have demonstrated sensing of biopressure, bioelectricity, analyte concentration, bacteria, and more. These structures potentially represent the evolution of wearable devices as they possess a negligible form factor and conform to any surface (such as skin or teeth), minimizing user impact. These devices also bypass more traditional, ""wearable"" gadgets that often require bulky mechanical fixtures or straps, require complex microfluidic systems or integrated electronics, cannot provide dynamic readout, and cannot be disposed of easily. Dielectric sensors are a class of structures that are able to probe the composition of a biofluid via their impedance spectrum, and can be configured for remote sensing via radio waves. These devices can be composed of isolated, thin film circuits, and are directly amenable to epidermal or tattoo formats. This measurement methodology is inherently tremendously powerful, as it can potentially measure multiple analytes at once by probing multiple resonance peaks, and can potentially be piggybacked onto existing RFID infrastructure for data readout. However, these capabilities have not yet been demonstrated, and under real-world applications dielectric sensors have often proven difficult to use. This is often due to simplistic readout (devices will directly correlate a single metric such s the real value of the impedance at a frequency to a biomarker) and are thus can be sensitive from user to user or to environmental conditions. Herein, the applicant will leverage the expertise and knowledge of the labs of Dr. Omenetto and colleagues to bring practical usability to these dielectric antennas, bridging the gap between laboratory measurement and real-time, and real-world health monitoring applications. The end-goal is to generate disposable, skin and teeth-mounted, dielectric sensors to remotely probe the presence of biomarkers in sweat, saliva, and potentially blood to draw definitive links between user nutrition and their health.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal seeks to create non-invasive, wireless sensor tattoos to be tagged onto the human body for probing the composition of saliva, sweat, or blood. These wireless sensors would present negligible impediment to the user, and would require next to no upkeep to maintain, potentially facilitating an unprecedented level of subject data collection and dissemination. Such data could yield conclusive links between diet, activity, biomarkers, and public health.            ","Development of epidermal, wireless sensor tattoos for non-invasive monitoring of biofluid composition",8980210,F32EB021159,"['Na element ', ' Sodium ', ' Solutions ', ' perspiration ', ' Sweat ', ' Sweating ', ' Tattooings ', ' Tattooing ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' teeth ', ' Tooth ', ' Tooth structure ', ' Ureaphil ', ' Urea Carbamide ', ' Elaqua XX ', ' Carbamide ', ' Urea ', ' World Health ', ' Nafion ', ' Silk ', ' Measures ', ' Film ', ' Impedance ', ' Electrical Impedance ', ' electric impedance ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Surface ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Measurement ', ' Human Figure ', ' Human body ', ' enzyme activity ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Principal Component Analyses ', ' Principal Component Analysis ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Performance ', ' bioelectricity ', ' remote sensing ', ' Structure ', ' Devices ', ' Bypass ', ' response ', ' glucose meter ', ' glucose monitor ', ' Skin ', ' Microfluidic ', ' Microfluidics ', ' Radio ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Reader ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Validation ', ' wireless ', ' Wireless Technology ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' saliva composition ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Consumption ', ' usability ', ' non-invasive monitor ', ' real world application ', ' public health relevance ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Architecture ', ' Bacteria ', ' Behavior ', ' biological material ', ' Biomaterials ', ' Biocompatible Materials ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Cells ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Collection ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Electronics ', ' Evolution ', ' Feedback ', ' Fingerprint ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Ions ', ' Laboratories ', ' Libraries ', ' Medical Device ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Nutritional Science ', ' nutrition ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' radiowave radiation ', ' Hertzian Waves ', ' Radio Waves ', ' Running ', ' Saliva ', ' ']",NIBIB,TUFTS UNIVERSITY MEDFORD,F32,2015,56042,MA-07,0.059290984603354954
"KnowEng, a Scalable Knowledge Engine for Large-Scale Genomic Data-OVERALL     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary goal of the proposed Center of Excellence is to build a powerful and scalable Knowledge Engine for Genomics, KnowEnG. KnowEnG will transform the way biomedical researchers analyze their genome-wide data by integrating multiple analytical methods derived from the most advanced data mining and machine learning research to use the full breadth of existing knowledge about the relationships between genes as background, and providing an intuitive and professionally designed user interface. In order to achieve these goals, the project includes the following components: (1) gathering and integrating existing knowledgebases documenting connections between genes and their functions into a single Knowledge Network; (2) developing computational methods for analyzing genome-wide user datasets in the context of this pre-existing knowledge; (3) implementing these methods into scalable software components that can be deployed in a public or private cloud; (4) designing and implementing a Web-based user interface, based on the HUBZero toolkit, that enables the interactive analysis of user-supplied datasets in a graphics-driven and intuitive fashion; (5) thoroughly testing the functionality and usefulness of the KnowEnG environment in three large scale projects in the clinical sciences (pharmacogenomics of breast cancer), behavioral sciences (identification of gene regulatory modules underlying behavioral patterns) and drug discovery (genome-based prediction of the capacity of microorganisms to synthesize novel biologically active compounds).

"CRCNS: The role of sound statistics for discrimination and coding of sounds ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Humans and other animals can discriminate and recognize sounds despite substantial acoustic variability in real-world sounds. This ability depends partly on the auditory system's ability to detect and utilize high-order statistical regularities that are present in the acoustic environment. Despite numerous advances in signal processing, assistive listening devices and speech recognition technologies lack biologically realistic strategies to dynamically deal with such acoustic variability. Thus, a comprehensive theory for how the central nervous system encodes and utilizes statistical structure in sounds is essential to develop processing strategies for sound recognition, coding and compression, and to assist individuals with hearing loss.     This proposal presents a novel approach towards addressing the question of how the auditory system deals with and exploits statistical regularities for identification and discrimination of sounds in two critical mammalian auditory structures (inferior colliculus, IC; auditory cortex, AC) Aim 1 is to develop a catalogue of natural and man-made sounds and their associated high-order statistics. Cluster analysis and machine learning will be applied to the sound ensembles to identify salient statistical features that can be used to identify and categorize sounds from a computational perspective. Using information theoretic and correlation based methods, Aim 2 tests the hypothesis that statistical sound regularities are encoded in neural response statistics, including firing rate and spike-timing statistics of IC and AC neurons. Aim 3 will determine neurometric response functions and addresses the hypothesis that high-order statistical regularities in sounds can be discriminated based on temporal pattern and firing rate statistics of single neurons in IC and AC. Aim 4 will employ multi-site recording electrode arrays to tests the hypothesis that neural populations in IC and AC use high-order statistics for sound discrimination and that statistical regularities are encoded by regionally distributed differences n the strength and timing of neural responses or neuron-to-neuron correlations.     The study will provide the groundwork for developing a general theory for how the brain encodes and discriminates sounds based on high-order statistical features. A catalogue of neural responses from single cells, neural ensembles, and high-level statistical features that differentiate real world sounds will be developed and deployed as an on-line resource. The role high-order statics play for sound recognition and discrimination will be identified both from a computational and neural coding perspective, including identifying transformations across neural structures, spatial and temporal scales.     The project will foster collaborations between psychology, electrical engineering, and biomedical engineering departments at the UConn. Graduate, undergraduate and a post-doctoral student, including women and minorities, will participate in the research and will receive interdisciplinary training in areas of neurophysiology, computation neuroscience, and engineering. Drs. Read and Escabi regularly host summer interns in their labs and expect that 1-2 undergraduate students will be hosted per year. Graduate students will be enrolled in biomedical, electrical engineering, and psychology programs. Project findings will be integrated in graduate computational neuroscience and biomedical engineering coursework.     The findings could lead to a host of new sound recognition technologies that make use of high-order statistical regularities to recognize and differentiate amongst sounds. Understanding how high-order statistics are represented in the brain could guide the development of optimal algorithms for detecting a target sound (e.g., speech) in variable/noisy conditions. Such sound recognition systems are also applicable in industrial applications: for instance, identifying fault machine systems from machine generated sounds. Knowledge of the statistical distributions in real world sounds and music will be useful for sound compression (e.g., mpeg coding) and to develop efficient sound processing algorithms. Finally, the findings can be incorporated in auditory prosthetics that mimic normal hearing physiology and make use of high-order sound statistics to remove background noise or enhance intelligibility.

"Artificial Intelligence in a Mobile Intervention for Depression (AIM) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary aim of this proposal is to develop and evaluate the use of state of the art machine learning approaches within a mobile intervention application for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). Machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, focuses on the development of algorithms that automatically improve and evolve based on collected data. Machine learning models can learn to detect complex, latent patterns in data and apply such knowledge to decision making in real time. The proposed intervention, called IntelliCare, will use ongoing data collected from the patient and intervention application to continuously adapt intervention content, content form, and motivational messaging to create a highly tailored and user-responsive treatment system. Behavioral intervention technologies (BITs), including web-based and mobile interventions, have been developed and are increasingly being used to treat MDD. BITs are moderately effective in treating depression, particularly when guided by human coaching via email or telephone. However, lack of personalization and inability to adapt to patient needs or preferences, which results in a perceived lack of relevance, contributes to poorer adherence and outcomes. IntelliCare will be designed as a mobile application, but will be accessible via computer web browsers and tablets. The IntelliCare machine learning framework will use individual data obtained from use data (e.g., length of time using a treatment component), embedded sensors in the phone (e.g., GPS), and the user's self-reports (e.g., ""like"" and usefulness ratings of treatment components) to provide a highly tailored intervention that can learn from the patient and adapt intervention and motivational materials to the patient's preferences and state. Low intensity coaching will serve as a backstop to support adherence. This project will contain three phases.  Phase 1 will involve the development of IntelliCare and its optimization through usability testing.  Phase 2 will be a field trial of 200 users who will receive IntelliCare for 12 weeks. The field trial has two aims: first to complete usability testing and optimization of the treatment framework, and second to develop the machine learning models and algorithms. Phase 3 will subject IntelliCare to a double blind, randomized controlled trial, comparing it to MobilCare. MobilCare will be identical to IntelliCare except that it will use standard presentation and presentation, rather than machine learning, to provide treatment and motivational materials. We will recruit half the participants from primary care settings, as this is the de facto site for treatment of depression in the United States, and half through the Internet, which is the main portal to health apps. The application of adaptive machine learning analytics to a mobile intervention has the potential to create a new generation of BITs that could revolutionize the way that such interventions are conceptualized, designed, and deployed. These innovations would have broad consequences and could be extended a broader range of BITS, including web- based interventions, and to other interventions targeting a wide range of health and mental health problems. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will create and evaluate IntelliCare, a mobile intervention also accessible by web browser, for depression. IntelliCare will harness modern adaptive machine learning analytics that can learn from a user's activity on the application, embedded phone sensors, and patient report to tailor intervention elements and motivational messaging to the needs and preferences of the user.

"NRI: An Egocentric Computer Vision based Active Learning Co-Robot Wheelchair DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The aim of this proposal is to conduct research on the foundational models and algorithms in computer vision and machine learning for an egocentric vision based active learning co-robot wheelchair system to improve the quality of life of elders and disabled who have limited hand functionality or no hand functionality at all, and rely on wheelchairs for mobility. In this co-robt system, the wheelchair users wear a pair of egocentric camera glasses, i.e., the camera is capturing the users' field-of-the-views. This project help reduce the patients' reliance on care-givers. It fits NINR's mission in addressing key issues raised by the Nation's aging population and shortages of healthcare workforces, and in supporting patient-focused research that encourage and enable individuals to become guardians of their own well-beings.  The egocentric camera serves two purposes. On one hand, from vision based motion sensing, the system can capture unique head motion patterns of the users to control the robot wheelchair in a noninvasive way. Secondly, it serves as a unique environment aware vision sensor for the co-robot system as the user will naturally respond to the surroundings by turning their focus of attention, either consciously or subconsciously. Based on the inputs from the egocentric vision sensor and other on-board robotic sensors, an online learning reservoir computing network is exploited, which not only enables the robotic wheelchair system to actively solicit controls from the users when uncertainty is too high for autonomous operation, but also facilitates the robotic wheelchair system to learn from the solicited user controls. This way, the closed- loop co-robot wheelchair system will evolve and be more capable of handling more complicated environment overtime.  The aims ofthe project include: 1) develop an method to harness egocentric computer vision-based sensing of head movements as an alternative method for wheelchair control; 2) develop a method leveraging visual motion from the egocentric camera for category independent moving obstacle detection; and 3) close the loop of the active learning co-robot wheelchair system through uncertainty based active online learning. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:          The project will improve the quality of life of those elders and disabled who rely on wheelchairs for mobility, and reduce their reliance on care-givers. It builds an intelligent wheelchair robot system that can adapt itself to the personalized behavior of the user.

"Unassisted Blood Pressure Monitoring Using Arterial Tonometry and Photoplethysmography ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose a tonometry based solution to the problem of inexpensive, unencumbering and non- invasive measurement of blood pressure. The proposed solution will be useful in clinical as well as ambulatory blood pressure measurements. Specifically, we propose to develop a large (1cm x 5cm) two-dimensional array of pressure sensors with 0.2mm spacing (24x128 pressure-sensing elements), together with robust signal processing algorithms with a feedback controlled band-tightening mechanism in order to measure blood pressure at the wrist. The pressure sensor array together with a photoplethysmogram (PPG) sensor will be embedded in a band, and will provide signals through a multiplexed circuit designed. Signal conditioning techniques will be used to get the large amount of data in the form that can be efficiently processed on a microcontroller. The proposed two-dimensional array of pressure sensors will be built using flexible plastic and micro-fabrication techniques. The increased size of the sensor array will ensure proper contact and pressure application with arteries in the wrist for tonometric measurement of BP. The signals generated from the sensor array will be processed through advanced signal processing and optimization techniques to handle the huge amount of data and to mitigate noise. The PPG signals will be used at the wrist to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the system. The sensor array system will be embodied in the form of a band, which will be integrated in a wearable device such as smartwatch. The capabilities of the smartwatch will be used for data processing and analytics. a) Design, develop, and test a two-dimensional pressure sensor array on a polyimide flexible substrate b) Process large amount of analog data from sensor array using signal conditioning and processing techniques  to generate blood pressure estimates c) Design a user friendly prototype form factor, and perform a clinical trial to validate device performance  The engineering members of our multidisciplinary team have specialized in cardiac instrumentation, signal and image processing for medical applications, pressure and touch sensors, signal processing and robust optimization. The team members with clinical expertise have been engaged in blood pressure trials in US, and have been working with leading institutions in India engaged in cardiovascular research. This proposal brings together their unique expertise and experience to innovatively address this challenging problem through a joint effort.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Unmanaged hypertension is a major problem, and its management based on occasional measurement is known to be suboptimal.

"Cloud Based Resource for Data Hosting, Visualization and Analysis Using UCSC Canc DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cancer genomics resources are growing at an unprecedented pace. However, a comprehensive analysis of the cancer genome still remains a daunting challenge. This is in part due to the difficulties in visualizing, integrating, and analyzng cancer genomics data with current technologies. We propose to develop a cloud-based platform to empower researchers with the ability to host, visualize and analyze their own data. The platform is composed of a set of Cancer Analytics Virtual Machines (CAVMs). The main component of each CAVM is a data server which functions to store and serve user data to applications, such as the UCSC Cancer Genomics Browser, to provide data visualization. The second component is a modified Galaxy workflow system to provide data analysis capability. UCSC's suite of analysis tools for nextgen sequencing data analysis and pathway inference will be prepackaged with the system. The two components will be highly integrated to allow tightly coupled cycles of data visualization and analysis. The data server component will be modular such that it can provide data independently to applications besides the Cancer Browser and Galaxy. We will deliver virtual machine images that can be easily initiated in a commercial cloud such as Amazon, or can be installed within a user's own institution. The CAVM also functions as a way for users to Integrate with external large-scale databases. We will deliver a UCSC CAVM that other CAVM instances can connect to, to provide authorized data access from the UCSC cancer genomics data repository. The system allows the dynamic formation of new datasets composed of data slices from multiple sources. This ability to combine data into larger samples will provide the statistical power to allow discoveries that would otherwise not be possible. We aim to eliminate, or significantly reduce, the overhead of system configuration and software installation. Our tools will provide users the capability to access a cloud-based cluster computing environment, which will make sophisticated, computationally intensive analyses accessible to researchers who might not, have access to compute servers. The software platform we develop can be used by individual bench biologists, and also by large projects to serve data to individual users or to other projects. This design has the potential to form an expansive federated database accessible through the same software interface.         RELEVANCE: Currently, clinicians and bench biologists typically depend on external collaborators for data analysis. The proposed system will provide these scientists with data analysis and visualization methods that are both powerful and easy to use. This will accelerate research in the understanding and treatment of cancer, the second-leading cause of death in the U.S. ","Cloud Based Resource for Data Hosting, Visualization and Analysis Using UCSC Canc",8889644,U24CA180951,"['neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Environment ', ' Genome ', ' Methods ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Science ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' synapse ', ' Synaptic ', ' Synapses ', ' Technology ', ' Work ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Ecological Systems ', ' Ecologic Systems ', ' Ecosystem ', ' Visualization ', ' Imagery ', ' Clinical ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Galaxy ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Source ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' empowered ', ' secondary cancer ', ' Secondary Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Secondary Malignancy (After Treatment of Primary Cancer) ', ' Secondary Malignancy ', ' Second Cancer ', ' Second Primary Cancers ', ' Sampling ', ' repository ', ' Genomics ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer therapy ', ' text mining ', ' literature searching ', ' literature mining ', ' discovery mining ', ' text searching ', ' Institution ', ' Data ', ' Collection ', ' Slice ', ' Update ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' oncogenomics ', ' cancer genomics ', ' cancer genome ', ' virtual ', ' data integration ', ' grid computing ', ' distributed computing ', ' datagrid ', ' data grid ', ' computational grid ', ' cluster computing ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Coupled ', ' large-scale data base ', ' large-scale database ', ' web interface ', ' sharing data ', ' federated database ', ' federated data ', ' federated computing ', ' TCGA ', ' The Cancer Genome Atlas ', ' nextgen sequencing ', ' next gen sequencing ', ' NGS system ', ' NGS Method ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' data hosting ', ' cloud based ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ,U24,2015,556381,CA-20,0.03463301236792748
"Continued Development of CellProfiler Cell Image Analysis Software DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Most laboratories studying biological processes and human disease use microscopes to image cells or other biological samples. Even for small-scale experiments, the information sought from images is increasingly quantitative and complex, and automated microscopes collect images faster than can be examined by eye.  We will continue our development of CellProfiler (www.cellprofiler.org) to meet this strong and growing demand for software to analyze biological images. CellProfiler is a versatile, open-source toolbox. Using its point-and-click interface, researchers build a customized workflow of image-analysis modules to identify and measure biological objects in images. It can extract valuable biological information from images quickly, even for high-throughput experiments, while increasing objectivity and statistical power in microscopy experiments.  Published only seven years ago, CellProfiler is already an important and widely used tool: it is launched 100,000+ times per year by users around the world and has been cited in more than 800 papers from 600 distinct laboratories. The software evolves in an intensely collaborative and interdisciplinary research environment with dozens of ongoing projects and has been successfully applied to a wide range of biological samples and assays, from counting cells to scoring complex phenotypes by machine learning.  We propose to improve CellProfiler's capabilities in order to enable further biological imaging research, meet the needs of the growing user base, and expand the community that benefits from CellProfiler:  First, microscopy experiments are rapidly expanding in both scale and scope, and are beginning to push CellProfiler's limits, particularly when they involve larger images (e.g., for tissue samples, cellular microarrays, large field-of-view cameras), multi-dimensional images (time-lapse and three-dimensional imaging), images for morphological profiling, and novel microscopy types (super-resolution and single-molecule imaging). We will upgrade CellProfiler's capabilities to serve these needs and add proven, state-of-the-art algorithms for image processing (especially segmentation and filtering for non-fluorescence images), time-lapse and 3D analysis, and novel microscopy types. We will also add features and usability improvements requested by the large CellProfiler community.  Second, we will enable researchers to create sophisticated bioimaging analysis workflows by expanding CellProfiler's interoperability with complementary software (e.g., MATLAB, ImageJ, MicroManager, KNIME).  Third, we will disseminate CellProfiler and provide user, educator, and developer support. There is great demand for our online forum, downloadable materials, and in-person tutorials (1,000+ attendees so far).  These improvements to the first, and still preeminent, open-source software for modular, high- throughput biological image analysis will enable hundreds of NIH-funded laboratories to make high-impact biological discoveries from microscopy images across all disciplines within biology. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Most laboratories studying biological processes and human disease use microscopy to analyze cells and other samples. We will enable these researchers to rapidly and accurately extract numerical data from microscopy images by continuing to develop and support our popular, user-friendly, open-source image analysis software, CellProfiler (www.cellprofiler.org), to accommodate the increasing scale and scope of modern microscopy experiments.",Continued Development of CellProfiler Cell Image Analysis Software,8910751,R01GM089652,"['Algorithms ', ' Award ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biology ', ' Cell Number ', ' Cell Count ', ' Cells ', ' Communities ', ' computer vision ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' Environment ', ' Explosion ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Laboratories ', ' Leadership ', ' Maintenance ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Microscopy ', ' body movement ', ' Movement ', ' Persons ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' living system ', ' Organism ', ' Paper ', ' Phenotype ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Computer Software Engineering ', ' Computer Software Development ', ' Software Engineering ', ' Stains ', ' Teaching ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Measures ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' Microscope ', ' improved ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Biological ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Scanning ', ' Slide ', ' Stainings ', ' Staining method ', ' meetings ', ' Speed ', ' Speed (motion) ', ' novel ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Laboratory Study ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Sampling ', ' biomedical imaging ', ' bioimaging ', ' single molecule ', ' Three Dimensional Medical Imaging ', ' 3D imaging ', ' 3-D Imaging ', ' Three-Dimensional Imaging ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cell imaging ', ' cellular imaging ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' 3D analysis ', ' 3-dimensional analysis ', ' 3-D analysis ', ' Three-dimensional analysis ', ' interoperability ', ' user-friendly ', ' open source ', ' human disease ', ' usability ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' Cloud Infrastructure ', ' Cloud Computing ', ' ']",NIGMS,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",R01,2015,589523,MA-07,0.027607144871263135
"KnowEng, a Scalable Knowledge Engine for Large-Scale Genomic Data-OVERALL DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary goal of the proposed Center of Excellence is to build a powerful and scalable Knowledge Engine for Genomics, KnowEnG. KnowEnG will transform the way biomedical researchers analyze their genome-wide data by integrating multiple analytical methods derived from the most advanced data mining and machine learning research to use the full breadth of existing knowledge about the relationships between genes as background, and providing an intuitive and professionally designed user interface. In order to achieve these goals, the project includes the following components: (1) gathering and integrating existing knowledgebases documenting connections between genes and their functions into a single Knowledge Network; (2) developing computational methods for analyzing genome-wide user datasets in the context of this pre-existing knowledge; (3) implementing these methods into scalable software components that can be deployed in a public or private cloud; (4) designing and implementing a Web-based user interface, based on the HUBZero toolkit, that enables the interactive analysis of user-supplied datasets in a graphics-driven and intuitive fashion; (5) thoroughly testing the functionality and usefulness of the KnowEnG environment in three large scale projects in the clinical sciences (pharmacogenomics of breast cancer), behavioral sciences (identification of gene regulatory modules underlying behavioral patterns) and drug discovery (genome-based prediction of the capacity of microorganisms to synthesize novel biologically active compounds). The KnowEng environment will be deployed in a cloud infrastructure and fully available to the community, as will be the software developed by the Center. The proposed Center is a collaboration between the University of Illinois (UIUC), a recognized world leader in computational science and engineering, and the Mayo Clinic, one of the leading clinical care and research organizations in the worid, and will be based at the UIUC Institute for Genomic Biology, which has state-of-the-art facilities and a nationally recognized program of multidisciplinary team-based genomic research.

"Automatically Creating and Updating Meta-Studies of Randomized Controlled Trials ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A ""meta-study"" (or ""meta-analysis"") collects and analyzes many studies on the same topic to understand if there is a meaningful, overall result. Meta-studies can support (or refute) interventions, spur new investigations, and lead to novel clinical guidelines. However, constructing meta-studies is a time intensive process of searching the literature, compiling the results, and performing the statistical analysis. Due to the time commitment that is required, many topics are unexplored, and many meta-studies are not kept up-to-date with the latest published results. Finally, a number of (unknown) biases, via subjective choices during the meta-study, may influence the results. Our long-term goal is to automate, as much as possible, the meta-study process. This should decrease subjective bias; increase the dissemination of evidence, especially for diseases and interventions that receive less attention; and allow for the automatic updating of meta-studies as new results are published. We propose a computer system that uses statistical machine learning to gather and group studies focused on similar interventions and outcomes; extract the necessary results from the text; and analyze the results using standard meta-analysis techniques. The final output will be presented in a spreadsheet-like Web-interface where users can explore and even change the data and meta-analyses. Our team uniquely blends technical expertise in machine learning with leadership in publishing meta-studies about Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), our disease of focus for our Phase I feasibility study. We are therefore qualified technically and able to ensure that the techniques generate valid and accurate meta-studies. Our Phase I results will define the current state-of-the-art for this novel task. Further, although we will initially focus n IBD, our Phase I results will demonstrate that our approach can generalize to other diseases, eventually applying to any intervention and any disease. The feasibility shown by our Phase I results will motivate our Phase II effort where we will focus on dramatically improving the approach, yielding broad coverage of all medical literature and generating human-quality meta-studies. We note that by the end of Phase I we should have a viable end-to-end prototype, focused on IBD, which we can begin taking to market. The final product should significantly benefit our target markets given the Phase II emphasis to improve the technology, user experience, and scope of covered diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  A meta-analysis collects and analyzes the results from multiple studies that are all focused on the same topic, and it can confirm (or refute) the overall effect across the studies, lead to changes in clinical guidelines, or spur new directions for research. However, generating a meta-analysis is an extremely time-consuming process, so many diseases are not covered, and most meta-analyses are not updated to reflect the latest published studies.

"An evaluation of sensor technology to monitor and report compliance with an evidence-based intervention to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The candidate, Nishi Rawat, is a Critical Care physician and Assistant Professor in the Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care Medicine at Johns Hopkins. Her goal is to become an independent investigator focused on advancing the field of quality improvement to improve the quality of health care delivered to Americans, while simultaneously reducing costs, with an emphasis on the application of information technology to evaluate performance, minimize waste and eliminate redundancies.  The candidate's preliminary work as a co-investigator for two collaboratives to reduce ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) suggests that there is a strong drive to eliminate preventable harms such as VAP, but weak available methodologies and resources to do so. There is a dire need for an effective and inexpensive methodology to track the delivery of evidence-based interventions for the purpose of quality improvement. The proposed research intends to fill this measurement gap. In this proposal, she evaluates the utility of the sensor approach for measuring and improving quality of care, focusing on VAP prevention intervention performance.  The aims propose: evaluate the utility of the sensor approach for measuring compliance with a VAP prevention intervention by comparing VAP process measure performance estimates captured by sensor technology to estimates obtained by traditional manual data collection (Aim 1); design and pilot a strategy to provide real-time feedback of sensor process measure compliance to providers (Aim 2); evaluate the impact of the sensor approach on VAP process measure compliance by comparing compliance before and after the implementation of the real-time feedback strategy (Aim 3). The proposed work could fundamentally change how healthcare monitors and reports important care interventions, and has the potential to make quality improvement more efficient, inexpensive and scalable.  The candidate is uniquely qualified to undertake the proposed work. She is double-board certified in Critical Care and Emergency Medicine, and has completed a Patient Safety and Quality fellowship. She has led multiple local quality improvement initiatives, and worked to decrease ICU costs as part of a national task force, and is currently co-investigator of large national infection prevention collaborative. It isher determination, enthusiasm and strong work ethic which have enabled her to balance these research activities with a heavy clinical commitment. She now needs protected time for research and career development to become an independent investigator.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this proposal is to improve quality of care by using low-cost, off-the-shelf, and non-invasive sensor technology to automate the measurement and feedback of data regarding whether patients receive an evidence-based intervention, patient mobilization, to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia.             ",An evaluation of sensor technology to monitor and report compliance with an evidence-based intervention to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia,8967301,K23HL125982,"['Anesthesiology ', ' Charge ', ' Critical Care ', ' Data Collection ', ' Emergency Medicine ', ' Environment ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' ethical ', ' Ethics ', ' Feedback ', ' Fellowship ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Frustration ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' State Hospitals ', ' Human Engineering ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Manuals ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Motion ', ' body movement ', ' Movement ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Nurses ', ' Patients ', "" Physicians' Extenders "", "" Doctor's Assistants "", ' Physician Assistants ', ' pressure ', ' healthcare quality ', ' health care quality ', ' Research ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' research and development ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Science ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' United States Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Department of Health and Human Services ', ' United States Dept. of Health and Human Services ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' United States Agency for Health Care Policy and Research ', ' Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ', ' Agency for Health Care Policy and Research ', ' AHRQ ', ' AHCPR ', ' United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Process Measure ', ' Caring ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' institutional infection ', ' Hospital acquired infection ', ' Hospital Infections ', ' Nosocomial Infections ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' wasting ', ' Research Activity ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Event ', ' Techniques ', ' Prevent infection ', ' Infection prevention ', ' preference ', ' American ', ' Performance ', ' care delivery ', ' professor ', ' novel ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' response ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' patient safety ', ' Provider ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Adherence ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Data ', ' Measurable ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Qualifying ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' cost ', ' Information Technology ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' public health relevance ', ' multimodal intervention ', ' multifaceted intervention ', ' multicomponent intervention ', ' multi-modal intervention ', ' multi-faceted intervention ', ' multi-component intervention ', ' Prevention Measures ', ' Big Data ', ' ']",NHLBI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K23,2015,159057,MD-07,0.016322200663309746
"Rapid Detection of Common Failure Modes for Knee Prosthetics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Bruin Biometrics' proposes to develop the Joint Health Monitor (JHM), an innovative low risk device capable of detecting artificial joint implant failure prior to all currently available diagnostic devices. Artificial joint replacements have demonstrated excellent clinical performance. However, failures do occur due to a multitude of factors including, aseptic loosening, wear, dislocation, osteolysis, and adverse local tissue reactions (ALTR), including pseudotumors and extensive tissue damage. Recent catastrophic failures associated with specific implant designs, and increasing concern over the severe clinical consequences of ALTR, have raised the attention of both consumer advocacy groups and regulatory agencies, in the US and abroad. It is evident that current diagnostic tools have failed to predict early enough complications associated with some implant designs and/or patient's characteristics. Rather than be predictive, current diagnostic methods usually do not detect joint degradation until bone and tissue damage have already occurred, increasing morbidity, mortality and severity of revision surgeries. Bruin Biometrics has developed an innovative monitoring device that will allow effective monitoring of an artificial joint functionality and eary detection of at risk patients, implant designs and reduction of the number or at least the severity of revision surgeries. Early detection should also enable physicians to prescribe exercise regimens, dietary supplements, medication, early revision surgery or other measures to protect against further damage. Moreover, the existence of an effective monitoring device would provide invaluable feedback, enabling unprecedented quantification and evaluation of treatment efficacy including drugs. The objectives of this proposal are to demonstrate the technical feasibility of this device to detect specific failure modes. This will be accomplished using an in vitro test rig set up and an in vivo human subject pilot study. Our overall goal is to rapidly delier a wearable system capable of monitoring the status of artificial joints and provide surgeons with more accurate and earlier diagnoses.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Hip and Knee replacement procedures will continue to increase dramatically over the next twenty years and the rate of revision surgery is expected to remain stable around 17-18%. This will increase the burden on orthopaedic surgeons, operating room capacity, and healthcare cost. In 2007 dollars, this volume of total joint replacement would generate costs exceeding $100 billion, or 1% of the gross domestic product (GDP). If successful, the new monitoring device object of this proposal named ""Joint Health Monitor"" will have an immediate impact on managing joint degradation, reducing complicated revision surgeries and allowing more effective patient surveillance avoiding catastrophic failure; this in turn will increase patient confidence in regulatory agencies and industry.            ",Rapid Detection of Common Failure Modes for Knee Prosthetics,8906609,R43AR067048,"['Acoustic ', ' Acoustics ', ' Algorithms ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Architecture ', ' Attention ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Consumer Advocacy ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' artificial environment ', ' Controlled Environment ', ' Physical Exercise ', ' Exercise ', ' Feedback ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hip ', ' Coxa ', ' Hip region structure ', ' In Vitro ', ' Industry ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' Knee ', ' Knee Prosthesis ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Names ', ' Operating Rooms ', ' Orthopedic Surgical Profession ', ' Orthopedic ', ' Orthopedics ', ' hypertrophic arthritis ', ' degenerative joint disease ', ' Osteoarthrosis ', ' Osteoarthritis ', ' Degenerative Arthritis ', ' Degenerative polyarthritis ', ' Osteolysis ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Risk ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' computerized tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' catscan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' EMI scan ', ' Computerized Axial Tomography (Computerized Tomography) ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' CT scan ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CAT scan ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' X-Ray Medical Imaging ', ' X-Ray Imaging ', ' Roentgenography ', ' Radiography ', ' Diagnostic X-Ray Radiology ', ' Diagnostic X-Ray ', ' Diagnostic Radiology ', ' Conventional X-Ray ', ' Diagnostic radiologic examination ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Total Knee Replacement ', ' Total Arthroplasty of the Knee ', ' TKR - Total knee replacement ', ' Prosthetic total arthroplasty of the knee ', ' Knee replacement ', ' Knee joint replacement operation ', ' Knee arthroplasty ', ' Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee ', ' Prosthetics ', ' Prosthetic device ', ' Prosthesis ', ' base ', ' human subject ', ' Procedures ', ' joint replacement ', ' Joint Prosthesis Implantation ', ' Replacement Arthroplasty ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Evaluation ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' Trust ', ' Nutritional Supplement ', ' Diet Supplement ', ' Dietary Supplements ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Bone Tissue ', ' hip replacement ', ' hip joint replacement ', ' Hip Prosthesis Implantation ', ' Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip ', ' Diagnostic Technique ', ' Diagnostic Method ', ' Diagnostic Procedure ', ' Severities ', ' Dependence ', ' Reaction ', ' Techniques ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Visit ', ' Surgeon ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' monitoring device ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' attenuation ', ' Modality ', ' Devices ', ' ray (radiation) ', ' Radiation ', ' Manufacturer ', ' Manufacturer Name ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' in vivo ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Fixation ', ' sample fixation ', ' cost ', ' rapid detection ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Implant ', ' public health relevance ', ' in vitro testing ', ' Regimen ', ' adverse consequence ', ' adverse outcome ', ' Dislocations ', ' Arithmetic ', ' ']",NIAMS,"BRUIN BIOMETRICS, LLC",R43,2015,149685,CA-33,-0.005088706821083804
"Context Understanding Technology to improve internet accessibility for users with DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this SBIR project is to develop a new tool to improve the ability of blind and visually impaired people to quickly get to the right web pages, to avoid ending up on the wrong web pages, and to reach the desired part of each web page efficiently. The motivation for this effort is that getting a 'big picture' understanding of a web page is one of the biggest challenges facing this population of computer users. Existing tools for blind and visually impaired people, such as screen readers and screen magnifiers, present the entire web page serially, in full detail, either by textual output of the details, or b providing a magnified view of a small part of the page. However, if the user is not already familiar with the website, the resulting lack of context requires a laborious and time-consuming process to scan through sometimes hundreds of details before knowing whether anything of interest even exists on the page in question. In contrast, the proposed technology analyzes web pages in a similar way that sighted users quickly scan pages before reading in detail, to provide a succinct, informative guidance on the context and layout of the page, so that a user quickly gains a much richer ""big-picture"" understanding. The proposed Phase II project builds on a successful Phase I user evaluation of a proof- of-concept of the software, in which users expressed a strong preference for the contextual cues provided by the approach. Phase II includes creating a fully-functional prototype of the software tool. Throughout the technology development, feedback from users and practitioners will guide the path of the R&D for maximum usability. At the conclusion of Phase II, an end-user, in-home evaluation study will verify the effectiveness of the tool, providing the starting point for full-scale commercialization. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The R&D in this Phase II SBIR project will result in an improved way to use the Internet for individuals with visual disabilities. The technology will help to overcome the lack of accessibility and high level of frustration currently found among blind and visually impaired users.

"Development and Evaluation of a Learning Electronic Medical Record System ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of this project to develop and evaluate a learning electronic medical records (L-EMR) system that draws a physician's attention to the right data, at the right time. It learns how to do so by analyzing patterns of patient data access f many physicians in many past cases in the EMR, and learning which EMR data to highlight that are relevant for making clinical decisions in a given patient.      The hypothesis underlying this research is that the L-EMR system will have sufficiently high precision and recall in highlighting relevant data, decrease the average time to assess an intensive care unit (ICU) patient case, and be judged by critical care medicine (CCM) physicians to be clinically useful.    The first aim of this project is develop a highly-usable L-EMR user interface. The L-EMR user interface will include zoomable time-series displays of lab-results, med-orders, and vital signs. Usability studies of the L-EMR user interface will guide revisions and enhancements.      The second aim of the project is to train statistical models that can be applied to a patient case to predict relevant lab-results, med-orders, and vital signs. We will enlist CCM physicians to review a set of retrospective ICU patient cases on a focused set of clinical conditions. Participants will review these cases as if they were active patients, identifying relevant lab- results, med-orders, and vital signs. We will train and evaluate statistical models to predict relevant data, and identify the best performing algorithm to include in the L-EMR system.      The third aim of the project is to evaluate the L-EMR system. We will recruit CCM physicians to evaluate an L-EMR system based on user interfaces from Aim 1 and statistical models trained using the best performing algorithm in Aim 2 to highlight relevant data items. We will measure the precision and recall of the data-highlighting functionality for assessing patient cases and making clinical decisions (e.g., lab and medication orders), the time required to assess cases with and without the highlighting, and physicians' assessments of the strengths and weaknesses of the L-EMR system.    If the results of these experiments are positive, as anticipated, this project will introduce a computational method that has significant potential to improve future EMR systems and enhance patient care.             Narrative The purpose of this research is to develop and evaluate a learning electronic medical records (EMR) system that draws a physician's attention to the right data, at the right time. The system works by analyzing patterns of EMR usage of physicians, and learning which EMR data to highlight that are relevant in a given patient.

"Head-mounted Activity Monitoring(HAM)System Fast Track DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The population of the United States, as in most developed nations, is aging and is doing so at an increasing rate. This change in demographics is having a dramatic effect on the nation's healthcare delivery system and the related public costs. The Congressional Budget Office predicts that the cost of long-term care for the elderly will reach $207 billion in 2020 and $346 billion in 2040. By 2030, spending for Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid will amount to almost 60% of the federal budget. The strong predilection of most of the elderly, and their families, is to prefer long-term care delivery in the home rather than in the institutionalized setting. This has resulted in a massive shift of elderly care costs t unpaid family caregivers, and this cost is not reflected in the budget numbers provided above. However, the continuation of this shifting of elderly care costs to family members is not sustainable due to the decrease in birth rate and the increasing number of adults surviving to old age without living children. As a result there will be an increasingly urgent need for publicly funded support of elderly home-based care while, at the same time, an equally urgent need to control the spirally cost of this care. More efficient delivery of home-care services for the eldery can have a significant impact on controlling, or even reducing, the cost of long-term elderly care. However, in order to deliver this care cost-effectively, a technology-based infrastructure optimized for this purpose will be required. One means of achieving this goal is by developing innovative mobile technology solutions which can monitor and maintain the activity, health and safety, and thereby the independence, of the elderly within the home. Our working hypothesis in this proposal is that a properly designed, head-mounted, wearable-computing solution can bring unique and powerful capabilities to address the need for more effective and lower-cost elderly home monitoring. We propose to develop a highly compact, light-weight, innovative technology called the Head-mounted Activity Monitoring (HAM) System. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project proposes to develop an innovative, low cost, ubiquitous and easy to use hardware and software system designed to support the independent living of the elderly. This wearable computing system accomplishes this by facilitating remote activity and safety monitoring, and also supports communication and interaction between the elderly, their caregivers, friends and family members, thereby reducing social isolation.",Head-mounted Activity Monitoring(HAM)System Fast Track,9077885,R44AG046969,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' Americas ', ' Behavior ', ' Birth Rate ', ' Breeding ', ' Budgets ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communication ', ' computing system ', ' Computer Systems ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' Health Sciences, Allied and Health Services Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' Ear ', ' Ear structure ', ' Electronics ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Spectacles ', ' Eyeglasses ', ' Family ', ' Feedback ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Hand ', ' Head ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' home health care ', ' Domiciliary Care ', ' Home Care Services ', ' home for elderly ', ' Old Age Homes ', ' Home for seniors ', ' Homes for the Aged ', ' Housing ', ' Independent Living ', ' Locomotion ', ' extended care ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' Memory ', ' Patents ', ' Legal patent ', ' Research ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' research and development ', ' Running ', ' Safety ', ' Social isolation ', ' Social Insurance ', ' Social Security ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Solutions ', ' Technology ', ' Telecommunications ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Friends ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' Family Care Giver ', ' Family Caregiver ', ' Family member ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Nexus Junction ', ' Nexus ', ' Low-resistance Junction ', ' Communicating Junction ', ' Gap Junctions ', ' Evaluation ', ' Funding ', ' Industrialized Nations ', ' Industrialized Countries ', ' Developed Nations ', ' Developed Nation ', ' Developed Country ', ' Developed Countries ', ' light (weight) ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' innovative technologies ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' Performance ', ' care delivery ', ' Agreement ', ' Devices ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Long-Term Care for Elderly ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cost ', ' software systems ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' mobile device ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' usability ', ' demographics ', ' prototype ', ' commercialization ', ' Secure ', ' arm ', ' three dimensional printing ', ' 3D printer ', ' 3-D printer ', ' 3-D print ', ' 3D Print ', ' Wearable Computing ', ' Wearable Computer ', ' ']",NIA,"GEN-9, INC.",R44,2015,846167,CA-18,-0.011627231886698034
"New Computational Methods for Data-driven Protein Structure Prediction Proteins and their interactions play fundamental roles in all biological processes. Accurate description of protein structure and interactions is a fundamental step towards understanding biological life and highly relevant in the development of therapeutics and drugs. However, there is a large gap between the number of available protein sequences and the number of proteins (complexes) with solved structures and accurate interaction description, which has to be filled by computational prediction. The long-term goal of this project is to apply statistical machine learning and optimization algorithms to understand protein sequence-structure-function relationship by analyzing low- and high-throughput sequence, structure and functional data and to develop algorithms for structure and functional prediction. Our hypothesis is that by developing sophisticated algorithms to take advantage of the growing sequence and structure data, we can model sequence-structure relationship much more accurately and significantly improve structure and functional prediction, in particular for this proposal, residue (atomic) interaction strength prediction and remote homology detection. This project has produced a few CASP-winning, widely-used data-driven algorithms and web server (http://raptorx.uchicago.edu) for monomer protein modeling. This renewal will not only further develop machine learning algorithms (especially Deep Learning and probabilistic graphical models) for monomer proteins, but also branch out to protein interactions (complexes). The specific aims are: (1) develop novel structure learning algorithms to predict inter-reside contacts and coevolved residues; (2) develop context-specific, coevolution-based, and distance-dependent statistical potentials using a new machine learning model called Deep Conditional (Markov) Neural Fields (DeepCNF); (3) develop Markov Random Fields (MRF) and DeepCNF methods for remote protein (interface/complex) homology detection and fold recognition to make use of long-range residue interaction predicted by the first two aims. This renewal will lead to further understanding and new models of protein sequence-structure-function relationship and yield publicly available software and servers for automated, accurate, quantitative analysis for a wide range of proteins and their interactions. The impact will be multiplied by tens of thousands of worldwide users employing the resulting software/servers to study a wide variety of proteins and interactions relevant to basic biological research and human diseases, in both low- and high-throughput experiments.

"Micromachined microphones with in-plane and out-of-plane directivity Project Summary We aim to introduce to the hearing-assistive device industry directional microphones with high signal-to-noise ratio, and the first commercialized microphone that combines all three axes of acoustic pressure gradient onto a single silicon chip. We expect the technology to empower the signal-processing community with a new tool which, when used in conjunction with a conventional omnidirectional microphone, will facilitate new features like ultra-sharp directionality adaptable in real-time by the user and/or artificial intelligence algorithms which scan for desired inputs while filtering out unwanted noise. Directional sensing and the ability to filter out undesirable background acoustic noise are important for those with hearing impairments. Hearing impairment is associated with a loss of fidelity to quiet sounds, while the threshold of pain remains the same. As such, hearing impairment causes a loss of dynamic range or “window” of detectable sound amplitudes. Directional sensing enables preferentially amplifying desired sounds without amplifying background noise. As the first step, we aim to accelerate the commercialization of recently introduced biologically- inspired “rocking” style microphones by synthesizing these designs with integrated, robust piezoelectric readout which is ideal for addressing the low-power, small-size, and high levels of integration required of the hearing-aid industry. Previous work in this field using laboratory prototypes and optical readout have demonstrated the merits of the biologically-inspired sensing approach (i.e. a simultaneous 20-dB SNR improvement and 10x reduction size improvement beyond what is achievable with present-day hearing-aid or MEMS microphones). By synthesizing a piezoelectric embodiment as an alternative to optical readout, we aim to accelerate through many of the commercialization challenges so that an impact to the hearing device industry can be made. Further, the proposed readout is better adapted towards integrating multiple microphones in the same silicon chip. We aim to integrate a microphone with both in-plane axis of directivity with an out-of-plane directional design to form a complete  -axis pressure gradient sensor. Project Narrative Studies show that today 2% of Americans wear a hearing aid, whereas at least 10% of Americans could benefit from a hearing assistive device. The major reason for this gap is patient dissatisfaction. Hearing-aid wearers suffer from what is known as the “cocktail party” effect. When the gain is turned up to hear the person speaking across from you, noises in the background are equally amplified – making every scenario sound like a cocktail party. This research aims to make a positive, long-term improvement to hearing-aid patient satisfaction by making commercially available directional microphones with high fidelity.",Micromachined microphones with in-plane and out-of-plane directivity,8981015,R44DC013746,"['Acoustic ', ' Acoustics ', ' Algorithms ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Communities ', ' Environment ', ' sound perception ', ' hearing perception ', ' Hearing ', ' Hearing Aids ', ' Industry ', ' Laboratories ', ' Persons ', ' Noise ', ' optical ', ' Optics ', ' Patient Satisfaction ', ' Client satisfaction ', ' Patients ', ' pressure ', ' Research ', ' assistive device ', ' Assistive Technology ', ' Self-Help Devices ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Si element ', ' Silicon ', ' sound ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' pain tolerance ', ' Pain Tolerance Level ', ' Pain Threshold ', ' sensor ', ' tool ', ' Scanning ', ' Techniques ', ' empowered ', ' American ', ' Devices ', ' Hypoacusis ', ' Hypoacuses ', ' Hearing Loss ', ' hearing impairment ', ' Address ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' SBIRS (R43/44) ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' prototype ', ' commercialization ', ' signal processing ', ' ']",NIDCD,"SILICON AUDIO, INC.",R44,2015,508997,TX-35,0.005649968740093399

"Continued Development of CellProfiler Cell Image Analysis Software DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Most laboratories studying biological processes and human disease use microscopes to image cells or other biological samples. Even for small-scale experiments, the information sought from images is increasingly quantitative and complex, and automated microscopes collect images faster than can be examined by eye.  We will continue our development of CellProfiler (www.cellprofiler.org) to meet this strong and growing demand for software to analyze biological images. CellProfiler is a versatile, open-source toolbox. Using its point-and-click interface, researchers build a customized workflow of image-analysis modules to identify and measure biological objects in images. It can extract valuable biological information from images quickly, even for high-throughput experiments, while increasing objectivity and statistical power in microscopy experiments.  Published only seven years ago, CellProfiler is already an important and widely used tool: it is launched 100,000+ times per year by users around the world and has been cited in more than 800 papers from 600 distinct laboratories. The software evolves in an intensely collaborative and interdisciplinary research environment with dozens of ongoing projects and has been successfully applied to a wide range of biological samples and assays, from counting cells to scoring complex phenotypes by machine learning.  We propose to improve CellProfiler's capabilities in order to enable further biological imaging research, meet the needs of the growing user base, and expand the community that benefits from CellProfiler:  First, microscopy experiments are rapidly expanding in both scale and scope, and are beginning to push CellProfiler's limits, particularly when they involve larger images (e.g., for tissue samples, cellular microarrays, large field-of-view cameras), multi-dimensional images (time-lapse and three-dimensional imaging), images for morphological profiling, and novel microscopy types (super-resolution and single-molecule imaging). We will upgrade CellProfiler's capabilities to serve these needs and add proven, state-of-the-art algorithms for image processing (especially segmentation and filtering for non-fluorescence images), time-lapse and 3D analysis, and novel microscopy types. We will also add features and usability improvements requested by the large CellProfiler community.  Second, we will enable researchers to create sophisticated bioimaging analysis workflows by expanding CellProfiler's interoperability with complementary software (e.g., MATLAB, ImageJ, MicroManager, KNIME).  Third, we will disseminate CellProfiler and provide user, educator, and developer support. There is great demand for our online forum, downloadable materials, and in-person tutorials (1,000+ attendees so far).  These improvements to the first, and still preeminent, open-source software for modular, high- throughput biological image analysis will enable hundreds of NIH-funded laboratories to make high-impact biological discoveries from microscopy images across all disciplines within biology. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Most laboratories studying biological processes and human disease use microscopy to analyze cells and other samples.

"CRCNS: The role of sound statistics for discrimination and coding of sounds ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Humans and other animals can discriminate and recognize sounds despite substantial acoustic variability in real-world sounds. This ability depends partly on the auditory system's ability to detect and utilize high-order statistical regularities that are present in the acoustic environment. Despite numerous advances in signal processing, assistive listening devices and speech recognition technologies lack biologically realistic strategies to dynamically deal with such acoustic variability. Thus, a comprehensive theory for how the central nervous system encodes and utilizes statistical structure in sounds is essential to develop processing strategies for sound recognition, coding and compression, and to assist individuals with hearing loss.     This proposal presents a novel approach towards addressing the question of how the auditory system deals with and exploits statistical regularities for identification and discrimination of sounds in two critical mammalian auditory structures (inferior colliculus, IC; auditory cortex, AC) Aim 1 is to develop a catalogue of natural and man-made sounds and their associated high-order statistics. Cluster analysis and machine learning will be applied to the sound ensembles to identify salient statistical features that can be used to identify and categorize sounds from a computational perspective. Using information theoretic and correlation based methods, Aim 2 tests the hypothesis that statistical sound regularities are encoded in neural response statistics, including firing rate and spike-timing statistics of IC and AC neurons. Aim 3 will determine neurometric response functions and addresses the hypothesis that high-order statistical regularities in sounds can be discriminated based on temporal pattern and firing rate statistics of single neurons in IC and AC. Aim 4 will employ multi-site recording electrode arrays to tests the hypothesis that neural populations in IC and AC use high-order statistics for sound discrimination and that statistical regularities are encoded by regionally distributed differences n the strength and timing of neural responses or neuron-to-neuron correlations.     The study will provide the groundwork for developing a general theory for how the brain encodes and discriminates sounds based on high-order statistical features. A catalogue of neural responses from single cells, neural ensembles, and high-level statistical features that differentiate real world sounds will be developed and deployed as an on-line resource. The role high-order statics play for sound recognition and discrimination will be identified both from a computational and neural coding perspective, including identifying transformations across neural structures, spatial and temporal scales.     The project will foster collaborations between psychology, electrical engineering, and biomedical engineering departments at the UConn. Graduate, undergraduate and a post-doctoral student, including women and minorities, will participate in the research and will receive interdisciplinary training in areas of neurophysiology, computation neuroscience, and engineering. Drs. Read and Escabi regularly host summer interns in their labs and expect that 1-2 undergraduate students will be hosted per year. Graduate students will be enrolled in biomedical, electrical engineering, and psychology programs. Project findings will be integrated in graduate computational neuroscience and biomedical engineering coursework.     The findings could lead to a host of new sound recognition technologies that make use of high-order statistical regularities to recognize and differentiate amongst sounds. Understanding how high-order statistics are represented in the brain could guide the development of optimal algorithms for detecting a target sound (e.g., speech) in variable/noisy conditions. Such sound recognition systems are also applicable in industrial applications: for instance, identifying fault machine systems from machine generated sounds. Knowledge of the statistical distributions in real world sounds and music will be useful for sound compression (e.g., mpeg coding) and to develop efficient sound processing algorithms. Finally, the findings can be incorporated in auditory prosthetics that mimic normal hearing physiology and make use of high-order sound statistics to remove background noise or enhance intelligibility.

"Improving cancer family history collection through social networking and artificial intelligence PROJECT SUMMARY  The  activities  proposed  in  this  NCI  K07  application  are  designed  to  advance  the  career  development  and  research  independence  of  Dr.  Brandon  M.  Welch.  Family  health  history  (FHx)  is  one  of  the most important  resources available to help clinicians identify disease risks. By knowing a patient's FHx, clinicians can quickly  identify  disease risks and initiate risk-reducing strategies such as increased screening, prophylactic surgery,  risk-reducing  therapeutics,  and  lifestyle  changes.  FHx  is  also  the  foundation  of  genomic  medicine.  Unfortunately,  the  collection  and  use  of  FHx  by  patients  and  clinicians  is  suboptimal.  To  improve  the  collection and use of FHx among the general population, a better FHx tool that is easier and more convenient  to  use  than  current  FHx  tools  is  needed.  A  new  FHx  web  tool,  called  ​ItRunsInMyFamily.com,​  incorporates  artificial intelligence and social networking to improve user engagement with FHx collection.Utilizing artificial  intelligence  based  chat  entity  can  improve  the  collection  of  FHx  information  by  making  it  easier  and  more  engaging to record FHx information, likewise social networking allows users to tap into the collective wisdom  and  knowledge  of  the  family  to  correct  inaccuracies  and  overcome  gaps  in  FHx  knowledge.  This research  study  will  first  identify  enhancements  to  ​ItRunsInMyFamily.com  ​that  will  further  promote  user  engagement,  with  particular  focus  on  rural and underserved patients (Aim 1). We will then evaluate whether this new FHx  tool can improve collection of cancer FHx in comparison with current FHx tools (Aim 2). Finally, we will assess  the impact of ​ItRunsInMyFamily.com ​on the clinical settings (Aim 3). To implement the research plan, it will be  critical  to  apply,  skills  obtained  through  K  award  learning  objectives,  namely  clinical  oncology  (learning  objective  1),  iterative  patient-centered  design  (learning  objective  2),  and  health  technology  assessment  (learning  objective  3).  To  fulfill  these  learning  objectives,  an  interdisciplinary  group  of  mentors  will  direct  a  comprehensive training plan. The training plan includes coursework, seminars, workshops, journal clubs, and  conferences,  covering clinical oncology, patient engagement, health disparities, user-centered development,  human-computer  interaction,  clinical  research  methodologies,  health  technology  assessment,  and  ethical  conduct  of  research.  The  strong  support  of  an  excellent  team  of  mentors,  and  the  vast  resources  of  the  Medical  University  of  South  Carolina,  create  an  optimal  training  environment.  Collectively,  the  integrated  learning  objectives  and  research  plan  are  critical  to  establishing  a  successful,  innovative,  and  meaningful  academic career focused on developing patient-centric informatics tools for oncology.   PROJECT NARRATIVE Family health history (FHx) is one of the most important risk factors for cancer and the foundation of genomic medicine, but is under-utilized by patients and clinicians. By incorporating artificial intelligence and social networking into a FHx tool, it will lead to greater engagement with FHx collection. This research study will identify and incorporate features that promote user adoption, and evaluate its impact on FHx collection.  ",Improving cancer family history collection through social networking and artificial intelligence,9222377,K07CA211786,"['Adoption ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Environment ', ' ethical ', ' Ethics ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Goals ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Mentors ', ' Methodology ', ' Patient Satisfaction ', ' Client satisfaction ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' research and development ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Rural Population ', ' South Carolina ', ' Technology Assessment ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Measures ', ' Workload ', ' Work Load ', ' symposium ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Social Network ', ' Journals ', ' Magazine ', ' base ', ' career ', ' man-machine interaction ', ' computer human interaction ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' Rural ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' satisfaction ', ' Family Cancer History ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' oncology ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' prophylactic ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' cancer risk ', ' Informatics ', ' Family Health ', ' Family health status ', ' genetic testing ', ' gene-based testing ', ' gene testing ', ' Genetic screening method ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Reporting ', ' Health Care Technology ', ' Health Technology ', ' career development ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Clinical Oncology ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Collection ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' next generation ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' user centered design ', ' clinical care ', ' therapeutic lifestyle change ', ' screening ', ' personalized cancer care ', ' Breast Cancer Patient ', ' Breast Tumor Patient ', ' Applied Skills ', ' Genomic medicine ', ' ']",NCI,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,K07,2016,173453,SC-01,0.01853934559667564
"KnowEng, a Scalable Knowledge Engine for Large-Scale Genomic Data-OVERALL     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary goal of the proposed Center of Excellence is to build a powerful and scalable Knowledge Engine for Genomics, KnowEnG. KnowEnG will transform the way biomedical researchers analyze their genome-wide data by integrating multiple analytical methods derived from the most advanced data mining and machine learning research to use the full breadth of existing knowledge about the relationships between genes as background, and providing an intuitive and professionally designed user interface. In order to achieve these goals, the project includes the following components: (1) gathering and integrating existing knowledgebases documenting connections between genes and their functions into a single Knowledge Network; (2) developing computational methods for analyzing genome-wide user datasets in the context of this pre-existing knowledge; (3) implementing these methods into scalable software components that can be deployed in a public or private cloud; (4) designing and implementing a Web-based user interface, based on the HUBZero toolkit, that enables the interactive analysis of user-supplied datasets in a graphics-driven and intuitive fashion; (5) thoroughly testing the functionality and usefulness of the KnowEnG environment in three large scale projects in the clinical sciences (pharmacogenomics of breast cancer), behavioral sciences (identification of gene regulatory modules underlying behavioral patterns) and drug discovery (genome-based prediction of the capacity of microorganisms to synthesize novel biologically active compounds). The KnowEng environment will be deployed in a cloud infrastructure and fully available to the community, as will be the software developed by the Center. The proposed Center is a collaboration between the University of Illinois (UIUC), a recognized world leader in computational science and engineering, and the Mayo Clinic, one of the leading clinical care and research organizations in the worid, and will be based at the UIUC Institute for Genomic Biology, which has state-of-the-art facilities and a nationally recognized program of multidisciplinary team-based genomic research.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Physicians and biologists are now routinely producing very large, genome-wide datasets. These data need to be analyzed in the context of an even larger corpus of publically available data, in a manner that is approachable to non-specialist doctors and scientists.

"Continued Development of CellProfiler Cell Image Analysis Software DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Most laboratories studying biological processes and human disease use microscopes to image cells or other biological samples. Even for small-scale experiments, the information sought from images is increasingly quantitative and complex, and automated microscopes collect images faster than can be examined by eye.  We will continue our development of CellProfiler (www.cellprofiler.org) to meet this strong and growing demand for software to analyze biological images. CellProfiler is a versatile, open-source toolbox. Using its point-and-click interface, researchers build a customized workflow of image-analysis modules to identify and measure biological objects in images. It can extract valuable biological information from images quickly, even for high-throughput experiments, while increasing objectivity and statistical power in microscopy experiments.  Published only seven years ago, CellProfiler is already an important and widely used tool: it is launched 100,000+ times per year by users around the world and has been cited in more than 800 papers from 600 distinct laboratories. The software evolves in an intensely collaborative and interdisciplinary research environment with dozens of ongoing projects and has been successfully applied to a wide range of biological samples and assays, from counting cells to scoring complex phenotypes by machine learning.  We propose to improve CellProfiler's capabilities in order to enable further biological imaging research, meet the needs of the growing user base, and expand the community that benefits from CellProfiler:  First, microscopy experiments are rapidly expanding in both scale and scope, and are beginning to push CellProfiler's limits, particularly when they involve larger images (e.g., for tissue samples, cellular microarrays, large field-of-view cameras), multi-dimensional images (time-lapse and three-dimensional imaging), images for morphological profiling, and novel microscopy types (super-resolution and single-molecule imaging). We will upgrade CellProfiler's capabilities to serve these needs and add proven, state-of-the-art algorithms for image processing (especially segmentation and filtering for non-fluorescence images), time-lapse and 3D analysis, and novel microscopy types. We will also add features and usability improvements requested by the large CellProfiler community.  Second, we will enable researchers to create sophisticated bioimaging analysis workflows by expanding CellProfiler's interoperability with complementary software (e.g., MATLAB, ImageJ, MicroManager, KNIME).  Third, we will disseminate CellProfiler and provide user, educator, and developer support. There is great demand for our online forum, downloadable materials, and in-person tutorials (1,000+ attendees so far).  These improvements to the first, and still preeminent, open-source software for modular, high- throughput biological image analysis will enable hundreds of NIH-funded laboratories to make high-impact biological discoveries from microscopy images across all disciplines within biology. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Most laboratories studying biological processes and human disease use microscopy to analyze cells and other samples. We will enable these researchers to rapidly and accurately extract numerical data from microscopy images by continuing to develop and support our popular, user-friendly, open-source image analysis software, CellProfiler (www.cellprofiler.org), to accommodate the increasing scale and scope of modern microscopy experiments.",Continued Development of CellProfiler Cell Image Analysis Software,9324484,R01GM089652,"['Algorithms ', ' Award ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biology ', ' Cell Number ', ' Cell Count ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Communities ', ' computer vision ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' Environment ', ' Explosion ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Laboratories ', ' Leadership ', ' Maintenance ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Microscopy ', ' body movement ', ' Movement ', ' Persons ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' living system ', ' Organism ', ' Paper ', ' Phenotype ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Computer Software Engineering ', ' Computer Software Development ', ' Software Engineering ', ' Stains ', ' Teaching ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Measures ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' Microscope ', ' improved ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Biological ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Scanning ', ' Slide ', ' Stainings ', ' Staining method ', ' meetings ', ' Speed ', ' novel ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Laboratory Study ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Sampling ', ' biomedical imaging ', ' bio-imaging ', ' bioimaging ', ' single molecule ', ' Three Dimensional Medical Imaging ', ' 3D imaging ', ' 3-D Imaging ', ' Three-Dimensional Imaging ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cell imaging ', ' cellular imaging ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' Three-dimensional analysis ', ' 3D analysis ', ' 3-dimensional analysis ', ' 3-D analysis ', ' interoperability ', ' user-friendly ', ' open source ', ' human disease ', ' usability ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' Cloud Computing ', ' cloud computer ', ' Cloud Infrastructure ', ' microscopic imaging ', ' microscopy imaging ', ' microscope imaging ', ' ']",NIGMS,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",R01,2016,175692,MA-07,0.027607144871263135
"Development of epidermal, wireless sensor tattoos for non-invasive monitoring of biofluid composition ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Non-invasive medical devices are fast emerging as powerful tools in providing quantitative, simple to parse data in assessing the health and wellness of users. These devices can provide information feedback to users on their state of health, and can potentially provide valuable real-time insight to doctors on the links between user consumption and activity on their respective health. Recently described epidermal electronics / multifunctional tattoos introduced from our lab and others have demonstrated sensing of biopressure, bioelectricity, analyte concentration, bacteria, and more. These structures potentially represent the evolution of wearable devices as they possess a negligible form factor and conform to any surface (such as skin or teeth), minimizing user impact. These devices also bypass more traditional, ""wearable"" gadgets that often require bulky mechanical fixtures or straps, require complex microfluidic systems or integrated electronics, cannot provide dynamic readout, and cannot be disposed of easily. Dielectric sensors are a class of structures that are able to probe the composition of a biofluid via their impedance spectrum, and can be configured for remote sensing via radio waves. These devices can be composed of isolated, thin film circuits, and are directly amenable to epidermal or tattoo formats. This measurement methodology is inherently tremendously powerful, as it can potentially measure multiple analytes at once by probing multiple resonance peaks, and can potentially be piggybacked onto existing RFID infrastructure for data readout. However, these capabilities have not yet been demonstrated, and under real-world applications dielectric sensors have often proven difficult to use. This is often due to simplistic readout (devices will directly correlate a single metric such s the real value of the impedance at a frequency to a biomarker) and are thus can be sensitive from user to user or to environmental conditions. Herein, the applicant will leverage the expertise and knowledge of the labs of Dr. Omenetto and colleagues to bring practical usability to these dielectric antennas, bridging the gap between laboratory measurement and real-time, and real-world health monitoring applications. The end-goal is to generate disposable, skin and teeth-mounted, dielectric sensors to remotely probe the presence of biomarkers in sweat, saliva, and potentially blood to draw definitive links between user nutrition and their health.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal seeks to create non-invasive, wireless sensor tattoos to be tagged onto the human body for probing the composition of saliva, sweat, or blood. These wireless sensors would present negligible impediment to the user, and would require next to no upkeep to maintain, potentially facilitating an unprecedented level of subject data collection and dissemination. Such data could yield conclusive links between diet, activity, biomarkers, and public health.            ","Development of epidermal, wireless sensor tattoos for non-invasive monitoring of biofluid composition",9148070,F32EB021159,"['Engineering / Architecture ', ' Architecture ', ' Bacteria ', ' Behavior ', ' biological material ', ' Biomaterials ', ' Biocompatible Materials ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Collection ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' electronic device ', ' Electronics ', ' Evolution ', ' Feedback ', ' Fingerprint ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Ions ', ' Laboratories ', ' Libraries ', ' Medical Device ', ' Methodology ', ' nutrition ', ' Public Health ', ' radiowave radiation ', ' radio wavelength ', ' Hertzian Waves ', ' Radio Waves ', ' Running ', ' Saliva ', ' Na element ', ' Sodium ', ' perspiration ', ' Sweat ', ' Sweating ', ' Tattooings ', ' Tattooing ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' teeth ', ' Tooth ', ' Tooth structure ', ' Urea ', ' Ureaphil ', ' Urea Carbamide ', ' Elaqua XX ', ' Carbamide ', ' World Health ', ' Nafion ', ' Silk ', ' Measures ', ' Film ', ' electric impedance ', ' Impedance ', ' Electrical Impedance ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Surface ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Measurement ', ' Human Figure ', ' Human body ', ' enzyme activity ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Principal Component Analyses ', ' Principal Component Analysis ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Performance ', ' bioelectricity ', ' participatory sensing ', ' remote sensing ', ' Structure ', ' Devices ', ' Bypass ', ' response ', ' glucose meter ', ' glucometer ', ' glucose monitor ', ' Skin ', ' Microfluidic ', ' Microfluidics ', ' Radio ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Reader ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Validation ', ' wireless ', ' Wireless Technology ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' saliva composition ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Consumption ', ' usability ', ' non-invasive monitor ', ' real world application ', ' public health relevance ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' ']",NIBIB,TUFTS UNIVERSITY MEDFORD,F32,2016,47190,MA-07,0.059290984603354954
"Slicer+PLUS: Collaborative, open-source software for ultrasound analysis Abstract The target users of the proposed Slicer+PLUS framework are researchers and developers who are focusing on low-cost point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) applications. POCUS applications are characterized by utilizing low-cost, portable U/S systems; in the hands of novice operators; with novel data acquisition, signal processing, and machine learning methods; with imprecise trackers; and in highly unconstrained point-of-care environments, e.g.: at the scene of accidents for patient triage, in the offices of general practitioners for scoliosis detection and monitoring, in patients' homes for an aging population, as well as throughout hospitals. In these contexts, many are considering POCUS devices to be the stethoscopes of the future.  The foundation of Slicer+PLUS is the integration and extension of 3D Slicer, PLUS, and MUSiiC. We are the developers of these libraries. We, and the users of our libraries, are proposing Slicer+PLUS so that the Slicer, PLUS, and MUSiiC communities can come together and cohesively address the important challenges and opportunities posed by POCUS applications. Over 30 letters of support are included with this application.  3D Slicer is a world-class, freely available open-source platform for medical image segmentation, registration, and visualization. PLUS is a world-class, open-source library for communicating with ultrasound machines and trackers (for following objects in 3D using magnetic, optical, and other technologies). MUSiiC is a (previously closed source) library that focuses on advanced ultrasound acquisition and analysis methods, such as ultrasound reconstruction pipelines, elastography, and photoacoustic imaging. Together, these toolkits have averaged over 5,100 downloads per month for the past year.  A central tenant of our work is that POCUS applications should not be viewed as simply involving the use of inexpensive, portable U/S systems; POCUS must be viewed as a new modality for it to attain its full potential. POCUS must involve innovative, automated data analysis methods and workflows that can guide a user to properly place and manipulate an ultrasound probe and interpret the returned ultrasound data. In particular, the output of those workflows and analyses should be quantitative measures, not b-mode images, since the expertise to interpret such images will not be readily available at points-of-care. To that end, the proposed work goes well beyond simple integration of Slicer, PLUS, and MUSiiC. Multiple innovations are proposed such as Ultrasound Spectroscopy for tissue labeling, Dynamic Textures for anatomic localization of ultrasound probes, and self-tracking ultrasound probes.  To assess our progress towards our goals, our team includes our target users: researchers, medical device manufacturers, and clinical innovators dedicated to low-cost POCUS applications. They will be validating our efforts by integrating them into their research and translational POCUS product development projects. Project Narrative  Low-cost ultrasound probes have the potential to become the stethoscopes of the future and revolutionize in-field and in-hospital patient care. Our goal is to integrate, enhance, and disseminate three cutting edge ultrasound acquisition, analysis, and display toolkits to create a new framework called Slicer+PLUS that will serve as a catalyst for research and product development into low-cost point-of-care ultrasound applications. In particular, our framework will include and facilitate innovative methods for guiding a novice user in ultrasound probe placement and for automatically interpreting ultrasound data to provide a diagnosis, without the user having to interpret a traditional B-mode ultrasound image at any point in the process. The Slicer+PLUS framework will be validated using tasks associated with (a) emergency service personnel performing Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) exams at the scene of an accident to detect or rule-out intra-abdominal bleeding; (b) the clinical monitoring of scoliosis progression in children in general practitioners' offices; and (c) the translation of research into regulatory-approved products based on Slicer+PLUS.","Slicer+PLUS: Collaborative, open-source software for ultrasound analysis",9176982,R01EB021396,"['Abdominal ', ' Abdomen ', ' abstracting ', ' Accidents ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomy ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Communities ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Diagnosis ', ' emergency service ', ' Emergency medical service ', ' Environment ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Generalists ', ' General Practitioners ', ' Goals ', ' blood loss ', ' Bleeding ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Hospitals ', ' Libraries ', ' Medical Device ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' optical ', ' Optics ', ' Patients ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' research and development ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' scoliosis ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Spectrum Analyses ', ' Spectroscopy ', ' Spectrum Analysis ', ' backbone ', ' Spine ', ' Spinal Column ', ' Vertebral column ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Translations ', ' Ultrasonography ', ' ultrasound scanning ', ' ultrasound imaging ', ' ultrasound ', ' sound measurement ', ' sonography ', ' sonogram ', ' diagnostic ultrasound ', ' Ultrasound Test ', ' Ultrasound Medical Imaging ', ' Ultrasound Diagnosis ', ' Ultrasonogram ', ' Ultrasonic Imaging ', ' Medical Ultrasound ', ' Echotomography ', ' Echography ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Visualization ', ' Imagery ', ' catalyst ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' Stethoscopes ', ' Clinical ', ' Letters ', ' Shapes ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Frequencies ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Source ', ' Texture ', ' System ', ' magnetic ', ' Magnetism ', ' innovative technologies ', ' hospital patient care ', ' novel ', ' Modality ', ' Devices ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Human Resources ', ' developing computer software ', ' develop software ', ' software development ', ' Documentation ', ' Manufacturer ', ' Manufacturer Name ', ' image guided therapy ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Intra-abdominal ', ' Slice ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' Monitor ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' point of care ', ' first responder ', ' emergency service responder ', ' emergency service personnel ', ' Emergency responder ', ' emergency service/first responder ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Output ', ' cost ', ' reconstruction ', ' Three-dimensional analysis ', ' 3D analysis ', ' 3-dimensional analysis ', ' 3-D analysis ', ' Trauma ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' imaging Segmentation ', ' data acquisition ', ' open source ', ' aging population ', ' population aging ', ' product development ', ' photoacoustic imaging ', ' elastography ', ' signal processing ', ' Patient Triage ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' ']",NIBIB,"KITWARE, INC.",R01,2016,777628,NY-20,0.04734912538163165
"Novel Use of Emergent Technologies to Improve Efficiency of Animal Model Research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Phase II project aims to continue development of a commercial quality, innovative cloud hosted information management system, called Climb 2.0(tm) that will increase laboratory efficiency and provide improved capabilities for research laboratories. Climb is designed to offer integrated laboratory process management modules that include mobile communications tools data monitoring and alert systems, and integrated access to Microsoft Azure Cloud(tm) Machine Learning and Stream Analytics services. Initially, Climb 2.0 will target animal model research laboratories; however, the core of the platform is designed to be adaptable to nearly any research type or related industry. Current research information management systems are primarily designed as record-keeping tools with little or no direct focus on laboratory efficiency or in enhancing value of the research data. They also do not leverage emergent mobile device technologies, social media frameworks, and data analysis and storage capabilities of cloud computing. Many laboratories still use paper as their primary recording system. Paper data logging is then followed by secondary data entry into a laboratory database. These systems are error prone, time consuming and lead to laboratory databases with significant time lags between data acquisition and data entry. Moreover, they do not recognized cumulative data relationships, which may identify important trends, and researchers often miss windows of opportunity to take action on time-sensitive events. In Phase I, RockStep Solutions demonstrated feasibility of an innovative Cloud Information Management Bundle system, Climb, which will increase efficiency and improve capabilities in animal model data management. During Phase I, a beta version of Climb was successfully developed and tested against strict performance metrics as a proof of concept. We successfully built a prototype with working interfaces that integrates real-time communication technologies with media capabilities of mobile devices. Phase II proposes four specific Aims: 1) Develop the technology infrastructure to support the secure and scalable Software as a Service (SaaS) deployment of Climb for enterprise commercial release; 2) Develop and extend the Phase-I prototype Data Monitoring and Messaging System (DMMS) into a platform ready for production use; 3) Extend Climb's DMMS adding a Stream Analytics engine to support Internet of Things (IoT) devices and streaming media; 4) Deploy a beta release of Climb at partner research labs, test and refine the product for final commercialization. To ensure Climb is developed with functionality and tools relevant to research organizations, RockStep Solutions has established collaborations with key beta sites to test all of the major functionality developed in this proposal. IMPACT: By leveraging emergent technologies and cloud computing, Climb offers several advantages: 1) enables real-time communications using familiar tools among members of research groups; 2) reduces the risk of experimental setbacks, and 3) enables complex experiments to be conducted efficiently.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The NIH Invests approximately $12 billion each year in animal model research that is central to both understanding basic biological processes and for developing applications directly related to improving human health. More cost-effective husbandry and colony management techniques, equipment, and new approaches to improve laboratory animal welfare and assure efficient and appropriate research use (e.g., through cost savings and reduced animal burden) are high priorities for NIH. RockStep Solutions proposes to meet this need by integrating existing and emergent software and communication technologies to create a novel solution, Climb 2.0, for research animal data management.

"Capti Screen Reading Assistant for Goal Directed Web Browsing ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Web browsing with assistive technologies such as screen readers and magnifiers can often be a frustrating and challenging experience for people with vision impairments, because it entails a lot of searching for content, forms, and links that are required for doing online tasks such as shopping, bill-payment, reservations, etc. This SBIR Phase II project will build on Phase I results and will continue the development and eventual deployment of Capti Screen Reading Assistant - a next-generation assistive technology, enabling goal- directed web browsing for people with visual impairments. With Capti Assistant, users will be able to stay focused on their high-level browsing goals that are expressed in natural language (spoken or typed). The Assistant will lead the users step-by-step towards the fulfillment of these goals by offering suggestions on what action to take at every step of the way and automatically executing the chosen action on behalf of the user. Suggested actions will include operations such as form filling, activating controls (e.g., clicking buttons and links), et. Capti Assistant will dramatically reduce the time spent by people with visual impairments on performing tasks online. The Assistant will significantly improve the speed and efficiency with which they can interact with the Web, thereby, making people with disabilities more productive in today's web-based economy. Given a user browsing goal, expressed in a natural-language form, Capti Assistant will utilize a predictive model to guide the user toward the goal. The unique aspect of the Assistant is that its suggestions will be automatically learned from the user's own history of browsing actions and commands, as well as from the user's demonstration of how to accomplish browsing tasks that have not been done before. The Assistant will process user commands and present the suggested browsing actions to the user on demand, giving the user a choice between following the suggestions or continue browsing normally without accepting the suggestions. The functionality offered by the Assistant will go far beyond popular personal assistant applications such as Siri, which have not been designed specifically for people with vision impairments, and which cannot be used for ad hocweb browsing. Capti Assistant will go a long way towards bridging the growing web accessibility divide between the ways people with and without vision impairments browse the Web. For them, the Assistant will usher in a new era of independence and employability in our global web-based economy. Thus, from a broader perspective, goal- directed browsing will exemplify the vision of the Universally Accessible Web whose thesis is ""equal access for all"", i.e. anyone should be able to reap the benefits of the Web without being constrained by any disability.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This SBIR Project seeks to do Research and Development on goal-directed web browsing - the next generation accessible technology that will empower people with vision impairments to stay focused on their high-level browsing goals, while the browser will do low-level operations (such as clicking on links and filling forms) necessary to fulfill these goals. Goal-directed browsing will go a long way towards bridging the growing web accessibility divide between the ways people with and without vision impairments browse the web, thus improving independence and employability of the former in our global Web-based economy.

"Top-down control of auditory processing in the cortico-collicular network Project Summary Throughout life, humans and other animals learn statistical regularities in the acoustic environment and adapt their hearing to emphasize the elements of sound that are important for behavioral decisions. Using these abilities, normal-hearing humans are able to perceive important sounds in crowded noisy environments and understand the speech of individuals the first time they meet. However, patients with peripheral hearing loss or central processing disorders often have problems hearing in these challenging settings, even when sound is amplified above perceptual threshold. This study seeks to characterize how two major areas in the brain's auditory network, auditory cortex and midbrain inferior colliculus, establish an interface between incoming auditory signals and the internal brain states that select information appropriate to the current behavioral context. Single-unit neural activity will be recorded from both of these brain areas in awake ferrets during the presentation of complex naturalistic sounds that mimic the acoustic environment encountered in the real world. Internal brain state will be controlled by selective attention to specific sound features in these complex stimuli. Changes in stimulus-evoked neural activity as attention shifts among sound features will be measured to identify interactions between internal state and incoming sensory signals in these different areas. Previous work has identified a large corticofugal projection from auditory cortex to inferior colliculus that could produce task-dependent changes in selectivity in inferior colliculus. This study will test the role of these corticofugal projections by optogenetic inactivation of auditory cortex during recordings from inferior colliculus. Selective inactivation of specific pathways will characterize how the network of brain areas works together to produce effective auditory behaviors. Computational modeling tools will be used to determine, from an algorithmic perspective, how neurons encode information about the natural stimuli and how this encoding changes as attention is shifted between features. Data collected during behavior will be used to develop models that combine bottom-up sensory processing and top-down behavioral control. This computational approach builds on classic characterizations of neural stimulus-response relationships using spectro-temporal receptive field models. New models will be developed that incorporate behavioral state variables and nonlinear biological circuit elements into established model frameworks. Together, these studies will provide new insight into the computational strategies used by the behaving brain to process complex sounds in real-world contexts. Project Narrative Patients with hearing impairments and central neurological disorders have difficulty processing and making accurate judgments about auditory stimuli, particular in challenging noisy environments. We seek to understand how the healthy brain learns to extract useful information from sounds in order to guide effective behavior. These experiments will provide novel insight into how the brain solves problems that can be used to develop new devices and treatments for these debilitating conditions.",Top-down control of auditory processing in the cortico-collicular network,9005185,R01DC014950,"['Accounting ', ' Acoustic ', ' Acoustics ', ' Algorithms ', ' Animals ', ' Attention ', ' Auditory Cortex ', ' Auditory area ', ' Behavior ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Crowding ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Feedback ', ' Ferrets ', ' sound perception ', ' hearing perception ', ' Hearing ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Posterior Quadrigeminal Body ', ' Inferior Colliculus ', ' Judgment ', ' Learning ', ' Mammalia ', ' Mammals ', ' Midbrain ', ' Mid-brain ', ' Mesencephalon ', ' Midbrain structure ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' neurophysiological ', ' neurophysiology ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Research ', ' Rewards ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' sound ', ' Speech ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' auditory stimulus ', ' base ', ' hearing prosthetic ', ' hearing prosthesis ', ' ear prosthetic ', ' ear prosthesis ', ' auricular prosthetic ', ' Auricular prosthesis ', ' Peripheral ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' selective attention ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' awake ', ' receptive field ', ' Individual ', ' hearing disease ', ' Hearing Disorders ', ' Hearing problem ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' behavioral control ', ' Behavioral Manipulation ', ' Behavior Control ', ' Life ', ' Auditory ', ' Complex ', ' Stream ', ' Sensory ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' stimulus/response ', ' Response to stimulus physiology ', ' meetings ', ' Auditory system ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Devices ', ' Central Auditory Processing Disorder ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' behavioral influence ', ' behavior influence ', ' Sensory Process ', ' Hypoacusis ', ' Hypoacuses ', ' Hearing Loss ', ' hearing impairment ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Synaptic plasticity ', ' optogenetics ', ' ']",NIDCD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,327250,OR-03,-0.01812324337920666
"Artificial Intelligence in a Mobile Intervention for Depression (AIM) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary aim of this proposal is to develop and evaluate the use of state of the art machine learning approaches within a mobile intervention application for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). Machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, focuses on the development of algorithms that automatically improve and evolve based on collected data. Machine learning models can learn to detect complex, latent patterns in data and apply such knowledge to decision making in real time. The proposed intervention, called IntelliCare, will use ongoing data collected from the patient and intervention application to continuously adapt intervention content, content form, and motivational messaging to create a highly tailored and user-responsive treatment system. Behavioral intervention technologies (BITs), including web-based and mobile interventions, have been developed and are increasingly being used to treat MDD. BITs are moderately effective in treating depression, particularly when guided by human coaching via email or telephone. However, lack of personalization and inability to adapt to patient needs or preferences, which results in a perceived lack of relevance, contributes to poorer adherence and outcomes. IntelliCare will be designed as a mobile application, but will be accessible via computer web browsers and tablets. The IntelliCare machine learning framework will use individual data obtained from use data (e.g., length of time using a treatment component), embedded sensors in the phone (e.g., GPS), and the user's self-reports (e.g., ""like"" and usefulness ratings of treatment components) to provide a highly tailored intervention that can learn from the patient and adapt intervention and motivational materials to the patient's preferences and state. Low intensity coaching will serve as a backstop to support adherence. This project will contain three phases.  Phase 1 will involve the development of IntelliCare and its optimization through usability testing.  Phase 2 will be a field trial of 200 users who will receive IntelliCare for 12 weeks. The field trial has two aims: first to complete usability testing and optimization of the treatment framework, and second to develop the machine learning models and algorithms. Phase 3 will subject IntelliCare to a double blind, randomized controlled trial, comparing it to MobilCare. MobilCare will be identical to IntelliCare except that it will use standard presentation and presentation, rather than machine learning, to provide treatment and motivational materials. We will recruit half the participants from primary care settings, as this is the de facto site for treatment of depression in the United States, and half through the Internet, which is the main portal to health apps. The application of adaptive machine learning analytics to a mobile intervention has the potential to create a new generation of BITs that could revolutionize the way that such interventions are conceptualized, designed, and deployed. These innovations would have broad consequences and could be extended a broader range of BITS, including web- based interventions, and to other interventions targeting a wide range of health and mental health problems. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will create and evaluate IntelliCare, a mobile intervention also accessible by web browser, for depression. IntelliCare will harness modern adaptive machine learning analytics that can learn from a user's activity on the application, embedded phone sensors, and patient report to tailor intervention elements and motivational messaging to the needs and preferences of the user.

"New Computational Methods for Data-driven Protein Structure Prediction Proteins and their interactions play fundamental roles in all biological processes. Accurate description of protein structure and interactions is a fundamental step towards understanding biological life and highly relevant in the development of therapeutics and drugs. However, there is a large gap between the number of available protein sequences and the number of proteins (complexes) with solved structures and accurate interaction description, which has to be filled by computational prediction. The long-term goal of this project is to apply statistical machine learning and optimization algorithms to understand protein sequence-structure-function relationship by analyzing low- and high-throughput sequence, structure and functional data and to develop algorithms for structure and functional prediction. Our hypothesis is that by developing sophisticated algorithms to take advantage of the growing sequence and structure data, we can model sequence-structure relationship much more accurately and significantly improve structure and functional prediction, in particular for this proposal, residue (atomic) interaction strength prediction and remote homology detection. This project has produced a few CASP-winning, widely-used data-driven algorithms and web server (http://raptorx.uchicago.edu) for monomer protein modeling. This renewal will not only further develop machine learning algorithms (especially Deep Learning and probabilistic graphical models) for monomer proteins, but also branch out to protein interactions (complexes). The specific aims are: (1) develop novel structure learning algorithms to predict inter-reside contacts and coevolved residues; (2) develop context-specific, coevolution-based, and distance-dependent statistical potentials using a new machine learning model called Deep Conditional (Markov) Neural Fields (DeepCNF); (3) develop Markov Random Fields (MRF) and DeepCNF methods for remote protein (interface/complex) homology detection and fold recognition to make use of long-range residue interaction predicted by the first two aims. This renewal will lead to further understanding and new models of protein sequence-structure-function relationship and yield publicly available software and servers for automated, accurate, quantitative analysis for a wide range of proteins and their interactions. The impact will be multiplied by tens of thousands of worldwide users employing the resulting software/servers to study a wide variety of proteins and interactions relevant to basic biological research and human diseases, in both low- and high-throughput experiments. Proteins and their interactions play fundamental roles in all biological processes including the maintenance of cellular integrity, metabolism, transcription/translation, and cell-cell communication.

"Unassisted Blood Pressure Monitoring Using Arterial Tonometry and Photoplethysmography ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose a tonometry based solution to the problem of inexpensive, unencumbering and non- invasive measurement of blood pressure. The proposed solution will be useful in clinical as well as ambulatory blood pressure measurements. Specifically, we propose to develop a large (1cm x 5cm) two-dimensional array of pressure sensors with 0.2mm spacing (24x128 pressure-sensing elements), together with robust signal processing algorithms with a feedback controlled band-tightening mechanism in order to measure blood pressure at the wrist. The pressure sensor array together with a photoplethysmogram (PPG) sensor will be embedded in a band, and will provide signals through a multiplexed circuit designed. Signal conditioning techniques will be used to get the large amount of data in the form that can be efficiently processed on a microcontroller. The proposed two-dimensional array of pressure sensors will be built using flexible plastic and micro-fabrication techniques. The increased size of the sensor array will ensure proper contact and pressure application with arteries in the wrist for tonometric measurement of BP. The signals generated from the sensor array will be processed through advanced signal processing and optimization techniques to handle the huge amount of data and to mitigate noise. The PPG signals will be used at the wrist to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the system. The sensor array system will be embodied in the form of a band, which will be integrated in a wearable device such as smartwatch. The capabilities of the smartwatch will be used for data processing and analytics. a) Design, develop, and test a two-dimensional pressure sensor array on a polyimide flexible substrate b) Process large amount of analog data from sensor array using signal conditioning and processing techniques  to generate blood pressure estimates c) Design a user friendly prototype form factor, and perform a clinical trial to validate device performance  The engineering members of our multidisciplinary team have specialized in cardiac instrumentation, signal and image processing for medical applications, pressure and touch sensors, signal processing and robust optimization.

"Development and Evaluation of a Learning Electronic Medical Record System ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of this project to develop and evaluate a learning electronic medical records (L-EMR) system that draws a physician's attention to the right data, at the right time. It learns how to do so by analyzing patterns of patient data access f many physicians in many past cases in the EMR, and learning which EMR data to highlight that are relevant for making clinical decisions in a given patient.      The hypothesis underlying this research is that the L-EMR system will have sufficiently high precision and recall in highlighting relevant data, decrease the average time to assess an intensive care unit (ICU) patient case, and be judged by critical care medicine (CCM) physicians to be clinically useful.    The first aim of this project is develop a highly-usable L-EMR user interface. The L-EMR user interface will include zoomable time-series displays of lab-results, med-orders, and vital signs. Usability studies of the L-EMR user interface will guide revisions and enhancements.      The second aim of the project is to train statistical models that can be applied to a patient case to predict relevant lab-results, med-orders, and vital signs. We will enlist CCM physicians to review a set of retrospective ICU patient cases on a focused set of clinical conditions. Participants will review these cases as if they were active patients, identifying relevant lab- results, med-orders, and vital signs. We will train and evaluate statistical models to predict relevant data, and identify the best performing algorithm to include in the L-EMR system.      The third aim of the project is to evaluate the L-EMR system. We will recruit CCM physicians to evaluate an L-EMR system based on user interfaces from Aim 1 and statistical models trained using the best performing algorithm in Aim 2 to highlight relevant data items. We will measure the precision and recall of the data-highlighting functionality for assessing patient cases and making clinical decisions (e.g., lab and medication orders), the time required to assess cases with and without the highlighting, and physicians' assessments of the strengths and weaknesses of the L-EMR system.    If the results of these experiments are positive, as anticipated, this project will introduce a computational method that has significant potential to improve future EMR systems and enhance patient care. Narrative The purpose of this research is to develop and evaluate a learning electronic medical records (EMR) system that draws a physician's attention to the right data, at the right time. The system works by analyzing patterns of EMR usage of physicians, and learning which EMR data to highlight that are relevant in a given patient. The main idea underlying the approach is that patterns of past EMR usage patterns can be exploited to selectively highlight clinically useful patient data.",Development and Evaluation of a Learning Electronic Medical Record System,9144440,R01LM012095,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Algorithms ', ' Attention ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' Critical Care ', ' Critically Ill ', ' Critical Illness ', ' Data Display ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Future ', ' gastrointestinal bleeding ', ' GI hemorrhage ', ' GI bleeding ', ' Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Goals ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Hemoglobin ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' Information Systems ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Intensive Care Units ', ' Laboratories ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' man-machine interaction ', ' computer human interaction ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Series ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Measurement ', ' Intravenous ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Medical Mistakes ', ' Medical Errors ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Test Result ', ' American ', ' Participant ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Management ', ' clinical test ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' research clinical testing ', ' trend ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' usability ', ' stem ', ' prototype ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' Bayesian Modeling ', ' Bayesian tracking algorithms ', ' Bayesian statistical models ', ' Bayesian spatial models ', ' Bayesian spatial image models ', ' Bayesian spatial data model ', ' Bayesian nonparametric models ', ' Bayesian network model ', ' Bayesian hierarchical model ', ' Bayesian framework ', ' Bayesian belief updating model ', ' Bayesian belief network ', ' Bayesian adaptive models ', ' Bayesian adaptive designs ', ' data access ', ' ']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2016,424376,PA-18,0.00774797562764427
"Crowd-Sourced Annotation of Longitudinal Sensor Data to Enhance Data-Driven Precision Medicine for Behavioral Health ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Longitudinal sensor data collected passively from mobile phones and other wearable sensors will transform behavioral science by allowing researchers to use ""big data,"" but at the person-level, to understand how behavior and related environmental exposures impact health outcomes. Computers will analyze individual-level data streams to permit unprecedented, individual-level precision in research and intervention. This type of precision medicine enables targeting of science and medicine to a particular individual's genetic makeup, past and current situation, and behavioral health exposures. Mobile phones, smartwatches, and common fitness devices are already capable of generating rich data on behavior, but developing algorithms to interpret that raw data using the latest machine learning algorithms requires practical strategies to annotate large datasets. We propose to develop and test the feasibility and usability of a mobile and online crowdsource-based system for cleaning and annotating behavioral data collected from motion sensors, mobile phones, and other mobile devices. Our goal is to demonstrate how individuals playing mobile and online games - the ""crowd"" - can collectively, affordably, and incrementally clean and add important metadata to raw sensor data that has been passively collected from individuals, similar to that from population-scale surveillance studies (e.g., the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and UK Biobank) and those planned for studies such as the White House's Precision Medicine Initiative. The game-playing crowd will thereby dramatically improve the utility of the datasets collected for a variety of scientific studies. We will validate our prototye system on datasets collected from motion monitors used to study physical activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep, but we will demonstrate how the system could be extended for use on the increasingly rich datasets that are being collected with mobile devices and that include not only motion data, but also sensor data on location, light, audio, and person-to-person proximity. We will then refine the system, foster a community of crowd game players interested in citizen science, and release the source code to the system as an open source project so that other researchers can adapt the technique for their own work.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Longitudinal sensor data collected passively from wearable activity monitors and mobile phones will transform behavioral science by allowing researchers to use ""big data,"" but at the person-level, to understand how behavior and related environmental exposures impact health outcomes and personalize health intervention and research. We propose to develop and test a system that permits typical mobile application game players to help scientists improve this type of data, by adding additional annotations that enrich the data, making it more useful for behavioral science and more amenable to automatic processing. This will help researchers to better understand how individual-level behaviors relate to health outcomes in current research studies that collect personal-level sensor data such as NHANES and the Women's Health Study, and future big data ventures such as the new Precision Medicine Initiative.        ",Crowd-Sourced Annotation of Longitudinal Sensor Data to Enhance Data-Driven Precision Medicine for Behavioral Health,9078547,UH2EB024407,"['Algorithms ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Crowding ', ' Data Collection ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Housing ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Interview ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Motion ', ' Persons ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Science ', ' Sleep ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', "" Women's Health "", ' Female Health ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Visualization ', ' Imagery ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Data Quality ', ' Funding ', ' tool ', ' instrument ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ', ' NHANES ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Stream ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' American ', ' Performance ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Devices ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' behavioral health ', ' Proteomics ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Genomics ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Car Phone ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabolomics ', ' fitness ', ' Data ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' meta data ', ' Metadata ', ' Output ', ' Source Code ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' open source ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' mobile device ', ' usability ', ' prototype ', ' public health relevance ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' surveillance study ', ' mobile application ', ' mobile app ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' precision medicine ', ' Precision Medicine Initiative ', ' sedentary lifestyle ', ' Sedentary life-style ', ' Sedentary behavior ', ' genetic makeup ', ' genetic make-up ', ' temporal measurement ', ' time measurement ', ' temporal resolution ', ' citizen science ', ' scientific citizenship ', ' crowd-sourced science ', ' crowd science ', ' civic science ', ' citizen scientists ', ' amateur scientists ', ' amateur science ', ' crowdsourcing ', ' crowdsource ', ' crowd-sourcing ', ' crowd source ', ' learning network ', ' mobile computing ', ' mobile technology ', ' mobile platform ', ' Data Science ', ' Data Scientist ', ' Accelerometer ', ' activity tracker ', ' activity monitor ', ' accelerometry ', ' ubiquitous computing ', ' ']",NIBIB,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,UH2,2016,299438,MA-07,0.0004255259228999269
"Cloud Based Resource for Data Hosting, Visualization and Analysis Using UCSC Canc DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cancer genomics resources are growing at an unprecedented pace. However, a comprehensive analysis of the cancer genome still remains a daunting challenge. This is in part due to the difficulties in visualizing, integrating, and analyzng cancer genomics data with current technologies. We propose to develop a cloud-based platform to empower researchers with the ability to host, visualize and analyze their own data. The platform is composed of a set of Cancer Analytics Virtual Machines (CAVMs). The main component of each CAVM is a data server which functions to store and serve user data to applications, such as the UCSC Cancer Genomics Browser, to provide data visualization. The second component is a modified Galaxy workflow system to provide data analysis capability. UCSC's suite of analysis tools for nextgen sequencing data analysis and pathway inference will be prepackaged with the system. The two components will be highly integrated to allow tightly coupled cycles of data visualization and analysis. The data server component will be modular such that it can provide data independently to applications besides the Cancer Browser and Galaxy. We will deliver virtual machine images that can be easily initiated in a commercial cloud such as Amazon, or can be installed within a user's own institution. The CAVM also functions as a way for users to Integrate with external large-scale databases. We will deliver a UCSC CAVM that other CAVM instances can connect to, to provide authorized data access from the UCSC cancer genomics data repository. The system allows the dynamic formation of new datasets composed of data slices from multiple sources. This ability to combine data into larger samples will provide the statistical power to allow discoveries that would otherwise not be possible. We aim to eliminate, or significantly reduce, the overhead of system configuration and software installation. Our tools will provide users the capability to access a cloud-based cluster computing environment, which will make sophisticated, computationally intensive analyses accessible to researchers who might not, have access to compute servers. The software platform we develop can be used by individual bench biologists, and also by large projects to serve data to individual users or to other projects. This design has the potential to form an expansive federated database accessible through the same software interface.         RELEVANCE: Currently, clinicians and bench biologists typically depend on external collaborators for data analysis. The proposed system will provide these scientists with data analysis and visualization methods that are both powerful and easy to use.

"Machine learning of physiological variables to predict diagnose and treat cardiorespiratory instability Project Summary/Abstract: If one could accurately predict who, when and why patients develop cardiorespiratory instability (CRI), then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve outcome and better use care resources. However, CRI is often unrecognized until it is well established and patients are more refractory to treatment, or progressed to organ injury. We have shown that an integrated monitoring system alert obtained from continuous noninvasively acquired monitoring parameters and coupled to a care algorithm improved step-down unit (SDU) patient outcomes. We also showed that advanced HR variability analysis (sample entropy) identified SDU patients at CRI risk within 2 minutes, and if monitored for 5 minutes differentiated between patients who would develop CRI or remain stable over the next 48 hours. We also applied machine learning (ML) modeling to our clinically-relevant porcine model of hemorrhagic shock to characterize responses to hypovolemia, hemorrhage, and resuscitation, predict which animals would or would not collapse during hypovolemia, and identify occult bleeding 5 minutes earlier than with traditional monitoring. We now propose to apply our work to vulnerable and invasively monitored ICU patients. We will develop multivariable models through ML data-driven classification techniques such as regression, Fourier and principal component analysis, artificial neural networks, random forest classification, etc. as well as more novel approaches (temporal rule learning developed by our team; Bayesian Aggregation) to predict CRI in ICU patients. We will first use our existing annotated high fidelity waveform MIMIC II clinical data set (4200 patients) to develop predictive models and differential signatures for various CRI drivers. We will also use our high-density data collection and processing platform (Bernoulli) to prospectively collect data from ICUs in three institutions: Univ. Pittsburgh (PITT), Univ. California (UC) Irvine and UC San Diego (initial algorithm development conducted at PITT and validated in the UC systems). We will identify the number and type of independent measures, sampling frequency, and lead time necessary to create robust algorithms to: 1) predict impending CRI, 2) select the most effective treatments, 3) monitor treatment response, and 4) determine when treatment has restored physiologic stability and can be stopped. We will also determine the smallest number and types of parameters coupled to the longest CRI lead time to achieve the above four targets with the best sensitivity and specificity (a concept we call Monitoring Parsimony).We will simultaneously iteratively design and test a graphical user interface (GUI) and clinical decision support system (CDSS) driven by these parsimoniously derived predictive smart alerts and functional hemodynamic monitoring treatment approaches in two human simulation environments (PITT & UC Irvine).We envision a basic monitoring surveillance that identifies patients most likely to develop CRI to apply focused clinician attention and targeted treatments to deliver highly personalized medical care. Public Health Narrative If one could accurately predict who, when and why patients develop shock then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve outcome and more effectively use healthcare resources. But signs of shock often occur late once organ injury is already present. The purpose of this study is to first develop multivariable models through data-driven classification techniques to parsimoniously predict cardiovascular insufficiency, etiology and response to treatment. We will do this first in our existing MIMIC II clinical data sets of 4200 ICU patients as to timing and types of instability. Then we will prospectively collect real time high- density data on patients admitted to our trauma intensive care units of University of Pittsburgh, UC Irvine and UC San Diego. We will create and test in simulators of ICU care bedside user interfaces to drive recognition and treatment algorithms based on these models in all three medical centers.",Machine learning of physiological variables to predict diagnose and treat cardiorespiratory instability,9029396,R01GM117622,"['abstracting ', ' Accounting ', ' Algorithms ', ' Animals ', ' Attention ', ' California ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardio-vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Critically Ill ', ' Critical Illness ', ' Data Collection ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' hemodynamics ', ' blood loss ', ' Bleeding ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Physiological Homeostasis ', ' Autoregulation ', ' Homeostasis ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Intensive Care Units ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Libraries ', ' Physiological Monitoring ', ' Physiologic Monitoring ', ' mortality ', ' Pathological Processes ', ' Pathologic Processes ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Resuscitation ', ' Risk ', ' Running ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' circulatory shock ', ' Circulatory Collapse ', ' Shock ', ' Hemorrhagic Shock ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Specificity ', ' Stress ', ' suid ', ' porcine ', ' Swine ', ' Suidae ', ' Pigs ', ' Family suidae ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Triage ', ' Universities ', ' Weaning ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' forest ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Normal Range ', ' Normal Values ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' density ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' mechanical respiratory assist ', ' Mechanical ventilation ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Refractory ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Medical ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Entropy ', ' Principal Component Analyses ', ' Principal Component Analysis ', ' Hour ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Stream ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Clinical Decision Support Systems ', ' Hypovolemia ', ' Medical center ', ' Accuracy of Diagnosis ', ' diagnostic accuracy ', ' neural network ', ' Biological Neural Networks ', ' simulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Organ failure ', ' data processing ', ' computerized data processing ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' fitness ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Clinical Data ', ' trial treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' early onset ', ' cost ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' bloodstream infection ', ' Sepsis ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' prospective ', ' Trauma ', ' Coupled ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' graphical user interface ', ' graphic user interface ', ' Graphical interface ', ' iterative design ', ' prototype ', ' high risk ', ' clinical care ', ' patient population ', ' treatment response ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' database structure ', ' data base structure ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' support tools ', ' improved outcome ', ' predictive tools ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2016,662537,PA-18,-0.035718232072422765
"Head-mounted Activity Monitoring(HAM)System Fast Track DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The population of the United States, as in most developed nations, is aging and is doing so at an increasing rate. This change in demographics is having a dramatic effect on the nation's healthcare delivery system and the related public costs. The Congressional Budget Office predicts that the cost of long-term care for the elderly will reach $207 billion in 2020 and $346 billion in 2040. By 2030, spending for Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid will amount to almost 60% of the federal budget. The strong predilection of most of the elderly, and their families, is to prefer long-term care delivery in the home rather than in the institutionalized setting. This has resulted in a massive shift of elderly care costs t unpaid family caregivers, and this cost is not reflected in the budget numbers provided above. However, the continuation of this shifting of elderly care costs to family members is not sustainable due to the decrease in birth rate and the increasing number of adults surviving to old age without living children. As a result there will be an increasingly urgent need for publicly funded support of elderly home-based care while, at the same time, an equally urgent need to control the spirally cost of this care. More efficient delivery of home-care services for the eldery can have a significant impact on controlling, or even reducing, the cost of long-term elderly care. However, in order to deliver this care cost-effectively, a technology-based infrastructure optimized for this purpose will be required. One means of achieving this goal is by developing innovative mobile technology solutions which can monitor and maintain the activity, health and safety, and thereby the independence, of the elderly within the home. Our working hypothesis in this proposal is that a properly designed, head-mounted, wearable-computing solution can bring unique and powerful capabilities to address the need for more effective and lower-cost elderly home monitoring. We propose to develop a highly compact, light-weight, innovative technology called the Head-mounted Activity Monitoring (HAM) System. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project proposes to develop an innovative, low cost, ubiquitous and easy to use hardware and software system designed to support the independent living of the elderly. This wearable computing system accomplishes this by facilitating remote activity and safety monitoring, and also supports communication and interaction between the elderly, their caregivers, friends and family members, thereby reducing social isolation.",Head-mounted Activity Monitoring(HAM)System Fast Track,9105328,R44AG046969,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' Americas ', ' Behavior ', ' Birth Rate ', ' Breeding ', ' Budgets ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communication ', ' computing system ', ' Computer Systems ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' Ear ', ' Ear structure ', ' electronic device ', ' Electronics ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Spectacles ', ' Eyeglasses ', ' Family ', ' Feedback ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Hand ', ' Head ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' home health care ', ' Domiciliary Care ', ' Home Care Services ', ' home for elderly ', ' Old Age Homes ', ' Home for seniors ', ' Homes for the Aged ', ' Housing ', ' Independent Living ', ' Locomotion ', ' extended care ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' Memory ', ' Patents ', ' Legal patent ', ' Research ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' research and development ', ' Running ', ' Safety ', ' Social isolation ', ' Social Insurance ', ' Social Security ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Technology ', ' Telecommunications ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Friends ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Family Caregiver ', ' Family Care Giver ', ' Family member ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Nexus Junction ', ' Nexus ', ' Low-resistance Junction ', ' Communicating Junction ', ' Gap Junctions ', ' Evaluation ', ' Funding ', ' Industrialized Nations ', ' Industrialized Countries ', ' Developed Nations ', ' Developed Countries ', ' lightweight ', ' light weight ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' innovative technologies ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' Performance ', ' care delivery ', ' Agreement ', ' Devices ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' elder care ', ' Long-Term Care for Elderly ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cost ', ' software systems ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' mobile device ', ' usability ', ' demographics ', ' prototype ', ' commercialization ', ' Secure ', ' arm ', ' 3D Print ', ' three dimensional printing ', ' 3D printer ', ' 3-D printer ', ' 3-D print ', ' Wearable Computer ', ' Wearable Computing ', ' mobile computing ', ' mobile technology ', ' mobile platform ', ' Accelerometer ', ' activity tracker ', ' activity monitor ', ' accelerometry ', ' ']",NIA,"GEN-9, INC.",R44,2016,456419,CA-18,-0.011627231886698034
"New Computational Methods for Data-driven Protein Structure Prediction Proteins and their interactions play fundamental roles in all biological processes. Accurate description of protein structure and interactions is a fundamental step towards understanding biological life and highly relevant in the development of therapeutics and drugs. However, there is a large gap between the number of available protein sequences and the number of proteins (complexes) with solved structures and accurate interaction description, which has to be filled by computational prediction. The long-term goal of this project is to apply statistical machine learning and optimization algorithms to understand protein sequence-structure-function relationship by analyzing low- and high-throughput sequence, structure and functional data and to develop algorithms for structure and functional prediction. Our hypothesis is that by developing sophisticated algorithms to take advantage of the growing sequence and structure data, we can model sequence-structure relationship much more accurately and significantly improve structure and functional prediction, in particular for this proposal, residue (atomic) interaction strength prediction and remote homology detection. This project has produced a few CASP-winning, widely-used data-driven algorithms and web server (http://raptorx.uchicago.edu) for monomer protein modeling. This renewal will not only further develop machine learning algorithms (especially Deep Learning and probabilistic graphical models) for monomer proteins, but also branch out to protein interactions (complexes). The specific aims are: (1) develop novel structure learning algorithms to predict inter-reside contacts and coevolved residues; (2) develop context-specific, coevolution-based, and distance-dependent statistical potentials using a new machine learning model called Deep Conditional (Markov) Neural Fields (DeepCNF); (3) develop Markov Random Fields (MRF) and DeepCNF methods for remote protein (interface/complex) homology detection and fold recognition to make use of long-range residue interaction predicted by the first two aims. This renewal will lead to further understanding and new models of protein sequence-structure-function relationship and yield publicly available software and servers for automated, accurate, quantitative analysis for a wide range of proteins and their interactions. The impact will be multiplied by tens of thousands of worldwide users employing the resulting software/servers to study a wide variety of proteins and interactions relevant to basic biological research and human diseases, in both low- and high-throughput experiments. Proteins and their interactions play fundamental roles in all biological processes including the maintenance of cellular integrity, metabolism, transcription/translation, and cell-cell communication. This proposal develops algorithms to understand protein sequence-structure-function relationship and to predict protein structures and interactions. The results will lead to a broad range of biomedical applications, such as better understanding of disease processes, development of novel diagnostics and drugs, and improved preventive therapies leading to reduced health care costs.",New Computational Methods for Data-driven Protein Structure Prediction,9191141,R01GM089753,"['Accounting ', ' Algorithms ', ' protein sequence ', ' Primary Protein Structure ', ' Amino Acid Sequence ', ' Cell-to-Cell Interaction ', ' Cell Interaction ', ' Cell Communication ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Maintenance ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolism ', ' Methods ', ' DNA Molecular Biology ', ' Molecular Biology ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Occupations ', ' Play ', ' Probability ', ' Proteins ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' structure function relationship ', ' chemical structure function ', ' Structure-Activity Relationship ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Translations ', ' Work ', ' Sequence Alignment ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Lasso ', ' Homologous Sequences ', ' Sequence Homologs ', ' protein folding ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' Individual ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' monomer ', ' protein structure function ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Protein Sequencing Molecular Biology ', ' Protein Sequencing ', ' Protein Sequence Determinations ', ' Amino Acid Sequence Determinations ', ' Peptide Sequence Determination ', ' Modeling ', ' protein complex ', ' Homologue ', ' Homolog ', ' GeneHomolog ', ' Homologous Gene ', ' Protein Family ', ' protein structure ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' protein structure prediction ', ' Coupling ', ' biological research ', ' human disease ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new drugs ', ' new drug treatments ', ' novel diagnostics ', ' next generation diagnostics ', ' new diagnostics ', ' therapeutic development ', ' High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing ', ' High-Throughput Sequencing ', ' atomic interactions ', ' deep field survey ', ' deep field image ', ' Deep Field ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' Preventive therapy ', ' Preventative therapy ', ' ']",NIGMS,TOYOTA TECHNOLOGICAL INSTITUTE / CHICAGO,R01,2016,29125,IL-01,0.009080675458251019
"Micromachined microphones with in-plane and out-of-plane directivity Project Summary We aim to introduce to the hearing-assistive device industry directional microphones with high signal-to-noise ratio, and the first commercialized microphone that combines all three axes of acoustic pressure gradient onto a single silicon chip. We expect the technology to empower the signal-processing community with a new tool which, when used in conjunction with a conventional omnidirectional microphone, will facilitate new features like ultra-sharp directionality adaptable in real-time by the user and/or artificial intelligence algorithms which scan for desired inputs while filtering out unwanted noise. Directional sensing and the ability to filter out undesirable background acoustic noise are important for those with hearing impairments. Hearing impairment is associated with a loss of fidelity to quiet sounds, while the threshold of pain remains the same. As such, hearing impairment causes a loss of dynamic range or “window” of detectable sound amplitudes. Directional sensing enables preferentially amplifying desired sounds without amplifying background noise. As the first step, we aim to accelerate the commercialization of recently introduced biologically- inspired “rocking” style microphones by synthesizing these designs with integrated, robust piezoelectric readout which is ideal for addressing the low-power, small-size, and high levels of integration required of the hearing-aid industry. Previous work in this field using laboratory prototypes and optical readout have demonstrated the merits of the biologically-inspired sensing approach (i.e. a simultaneous 20-dB SNR improvement and 10x reduction size improvement beyond what is achievable with present-day hearing-aid or MEMS microphones). By synthesizing a piezoelectric embodiment as an alternative to optical readout, we aim to accelerate through many of the commercialization challenges so that an impact to the hearing device industry can be made. Further, the proposed readout is better adapted towards integrating multiple microphones in the same silicon chip. We aim to integrate a microphone with both in-plane axis of directivity with an out-of-plane directional design to form a complete  -axis pressure gradient sensor. Project Narrative Studies show that today 2% of Americans wear a hearing aid, whereas at least 10% of Americans could benefit from a hearing assistive device. The major reason for this gap is patient dissatisfaction. Hearing-aid wearers suffer from what is known as the “cocktail party” effect. When the gain is turned up to hear the person speaking across from you, noises in the background are equally amplified – making every scenario sound like a cocktail party. This research aims to make a positive, long-term improvement to hearing-aid patient satisfaction by making commercially available directional microphones with high fidelity.",Micromachined microphones with in-plane and out-of-plane directivity,9098683,R44DC013746,"['Acoustic ', ' Acoustics ', ' Algorithms ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Communities ', ' Environment ', ' sound perception ', ' hearing perception ', ' Hearing ', ' Hearing Aids ', ' Industry ', ' Laboratories ', ' Persons ', ' Noise ', ' optical ', ' Optics ', ' Patient Satisfaction ', ' Client satisfaction ', ' Patients ', ' pressure ', ' Research ', ' assistive device ', ' Assistive Technology ', ' Self-Help Devices ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Si element ', ' Silicon ', ' sound ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' pain tolerance ', ' Pain Tolerance Level ', ' Pain Threshold ', ' sensor ', ' tool ', ' Scanning ', ' Techniques ', ' empowered ', ' American ', ' Devices ', ' Hypoacusis ', ' Hypoacuses ', ' Hearing Loss ', ' hearing impairment ', ' Address ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' prototype ', ' commercialization ', ' signal processing ', ' ']",NIDCD,"SILICON AUDIO, INC.",R44,2016,490980,TX-35,0.005649968740093399
"Socioeconomic status, stress, and smoking cessation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The prevalence of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) is rising dramatically among both adults and youth and ENDS use is fast becoming a major public health issue. However, because of their recent emergence, researchers know little about ENDS, their use, their effects on human physiology and health, their risks and benefits, or their impact on tobacco control efforts. A common barrier to studying ENDS is the lack of data on objective, real world use of ENDS. Thus, the proposed project aims to adapt existing innovative mobile assessment tools that can be used to target critical ENDS research gaps by providing mobile sensing technology that can objectively collect precise data regarding ENDS use in real time in real world. Specifically, the proposed revision project will expand the scope of Project On Track (1R01CA190329-01A1, PI: Wetter) by extending the application of puffMarker, an existing tool that automatically detects smoking, for the assessment of ENDS use. The current project has three aims: 1) adapt and validate puffMarker to identify discrete episodes of ENDS use, 2) adapt and validate puffMarker to distinguish between cigarette smoking and ENDS use among dual users of ENDS and cigarettes, and 3) utilize the Project On Track protocol to collect real time, real world data investigating potential determinants of ENDS use among both exclusive ENDS users as well as dual users of cigarettes and ENDS. Altogether, 120 participants (30 for Aim 1, 30 for Aim 2, and 60 for Aim 3) will be enrolled. Participants recruited for Aims 1 and 2 will attend laboratory (three 2-hour sessions) and field (3 days) studies. In the laboratory sessions, participants will wear the AutoSense wireless sensors and be asked to use ENDS (Aim 1) or use ENDS and smoke a cigarette (Aim 2). Participants' ENDS and cigarette puffs will be recorded by an independent observer. In the field studies, participants will wear the AutoSense wireless sensors and be asked to use ENDS (Aim 1) or use ENDS and smoke cigarettes (Aim 2). Participants will be asked to record each instance of ENDS use or cigarette smoking on a SP. The goals of the laboratory studies are to collect data to train puffMarker to identify ENDS use and to distinguish between cigarette smoking and ENDS use. The goal of the field studies is to validate puffMarker in real-life, natural environments. Aim 3 will utilize the Project On Track protocol to collect the first real time, real world data on ENDS and dual use. Participants will be assessed for 6 days using AutoSense, EMA, and GPS to examine potential determinants of ENDS use. A validated puffMarker that detects ENDS use and distinguishes between ENDS use and smoking can enhance many areas of research inquiry on ENDS. Knowledge learned from Aim 3 will be essential for the development of comprehensive conceptual models with respect to ENDS use and smoking cessation. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project aims to develop an innovative tool that targets important ENDS research gaps by offer- ing researchers the latest mobile sensing technology to objectively collect precise data regarding ENDS use and distinguish between ENDS use and smoking in real time and in real world.","Socioeconomic status, stress, and smoking cessation",9490765,R01CA190329,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Algorithms ', ' inspiration ', ' Respiratory Inspiration ', ' Respiratory Aspiration ', ' Inhaling ', ' Inhalation ', ' Breathing ', ' Behavior ', ' Grain ', ' Cereals ', ' Environment ', ' Geography ', ' Gestures ', ' Goals ', ' Hand ', ' Health ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Laboratories ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Physiology ', ' Public Health ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Stress ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' Wrist ', ' Measures ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' smoking cessation ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Series ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Training ', ' Mouth ', ' Cavitas Oris ', ' Buccal Cavity Head and Neck ', ' Buccal Cavity ', ' Oral cavity ', ' Individual ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' uptake ', ' tool ', ' Smoker ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' respiratory ', ' psychosocial ', ' experience ', ' field study ', ' field test ', ' field learning ', ' field based data ', ' Cigarette ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Harm Reduction ', ' Harm Minimization ', ' Laboratory Study ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' smoke cigarette ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Chest ', ' Thorax ', ' Thoracic ', ' Thorace ', ' Modeling ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' wireless ', ' Wireless Technology ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' tobacco control ', ' biobehavioral ', ' biobehavior ', ' systems research ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Abstinence ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' parent grant ', ' primary outcome ', ' population health ', ' High School Student ', ' Secondary Student ', ' Secondary School Student ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' built environment ', ' arm movement ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' Big Data to Knowledge ', ' BD2K ', ' data to knowledge ', ' data into knowledge ', ' Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems ', ' Longitudinal cohort study ', ' Long-term cohort study ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2017,641479,UT-02,0.026124656505164746
"Improving access to vision correction for health disparity populations with the QuickSee: an accurate, low-cost, easy-to-use objective refractor Summary The principal goal of this proposal is to increase the accuracy and precision of a low-cost autorefraction device called the QuickSee, in order to improve access to refractive eye care for underserved populations. Poor vision due to a lack of eyeglasses is highly prevalent in low-resource settings throughout the world and significantly reduces quality of life, education, and productivity. The existing QuickSee only extracts the lower- order aberration information contained within a wavefront profile of the eye, to roughly estimate an eyeglass prescription. This proposal will further improve the accuracy of the QuickSee device by exploiting both the lower- and higher-order aberrations contained within the complete wavefront. To realize this goal, we will enroll 300 subjects (600 eyes) in Baltimore, MD, and will obtain subjective refraction and visual acuity (VA) measurements and will use machine learning on this large dataset of wavefront profiles to optimize the wavefront-to-refraction algorithm of the QuickSee device. The main output of this project will be a robust and improved-accuracy next-generation QuickSee device that will increase efficiency of and decrease the training requirements of eye care professionals, and potentially dispense refractive correction that provides similar or better VA than correction from an eye care professional. Successful completion of this work will be an important step towards dramatically improving eyeglass accessibility for health disparity populations in the USA and internationally in low-resource settings. Upon completion of this proposal, we will apply for a Phase II award proposing to work with Wilmer Eye Institute research faculty to assess widespread deployment of the next-generation QuickSee with minimally-trained personnel in order to accurately and reliably provide thousands of pairs of low-cost corrective eyeglasses to underserved communities. Project Narrative This project proposal seeks to develop a novel technology that will disruptively increase the accessibility of refractive eye care for health disparity populations in low-resource settings. Specifically, sophisticated algorithms will be developed that improve the accuracy of the QuickSee device so that it can improve the efficiency of and reduce the training barriers for eye care professionals, and potentially provide refractive correction without the need for refinement by a trained eye care professional. Our goal is to develop a low- cost, easy-to-use, scalable solution to increase accessibility to vision correction globally.","Improving access to vision correction for health disparity populations with the QuickSee: an accurate, low-cost, easy-to-use objective refractor",9312420,R43EB024299,"['Algorithms ', ' Award ', ' Baltimore ', ' Brazil ', ' Calibration ', ' Communities ', ' Under-Developed Nations ', ' Under-Developed Countries ', ' Third-World Nations ', ' Third-World Countries ', ' Less-Developed Nations ', ' Less-Developed Countries ', ' Developing Nations ', ' Developing Countries ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' training status ', ' training level ', ' training achievement ', ' educational level ', ' Educational Achievement ', ' Educational Status ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye ', ' Spectacles ', ' Eyeglasses ', ' Feedback ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Guatemala ', ' Hospitals ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' India ', ' Institutes ', ' Mali ', ' Noise ', ' Optometrist ', ' Patient Schedules ', ' Patients ', ' Productivity ', ' Pupil ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Refractive Errors ', ' eye refraction disorder ', ' Refractive Disorders ', ' Research Institute ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' Visual Acuity ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Businesses ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Eye Examination ', ' Eye Exam ', ' Ophthalmic examination and evaluation ', ' Phase ', ' Training ', ' Measurement ', ' Industrialized Nations ', ' Industrialized Countries ', ' Developed Nations ', ' Developed Countries ', ' Spottings ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Country ', ' success ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' Devices ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Modeling ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Caliber ', ' Diameter ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' International ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Validation ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Output ', ' vector ', ' cost ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' next generation ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Impairment ', ' lens ', ' lenses ', ' Geometry ', ' faculty research ', ' health care disparity ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' ']",NIBIB,"PLENOPTIKA, INC.",R43,2017,200225,MA-05,-0.025239441788841722
"Machine learning of physiological variables to predict diagnose and treat cardiorespiratory instability Project Summary/Abstract: If one could accurately predict who, when and why patients develop cardiorespiratory instability (CRI), then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve outcome and better use care resources. However, CRI is often unrecognized until it is well established and patients are more refractory to treatment, or progressed to organ injury. We have shown that an integrated monitoring system alert obtained from continuous noninvasively acquired monitoring parameters and coupled to a care algorithm improved step-down unit (SDU) patient outcomes. We also showed that advanced HR variability analysis (sample entropy) identified SDU patients at CRI risk within 2 minutes, and if monitored for 5 minutes differentiated between patients who would develop CRI or remain stable over the next 48 hours. We also applied machine learning (ML) modeling to our clinically-relevant porcine model of hemorrhagic shock to characterize responses to hypovolemia, hemorrhage, and resuscitation, predict which animals would or would not collapse during hypovolemia, and identify occult bleeding 5 minutes earlier than with traditional monitoring. We now propose to apply our work to vulnerable and invasively monitored ICU patients. We will develop multivariable models through ML data-driven classification techniques such as regression, Fourier and principal component analysis, artificial neural networks, random forest classification, etc. as well as more novel approaches (temporal rule learning developed by our team; Bayesian Aggregation) to predict CRI in ICU patients. We will first use our existing annotated high fidelity waveform MIMIC II clinical data set (4200 patients) to develop predictive models and differential signatures for various CRI drivers. We will also use our high-density data collection and processing platform (Bernoulli) to prospectively collect data from ICUs in three institutions: Univ. Pittsburgh (PITT), Univ. California (UC) Irvine and UC San Diego (initial algorithm development conducted at PITT and validated in the UC systems). We will identify the number and type of independent measures, sampling frequency, and lead time necessary to create robust algorithms to: 1) predict impending CRI, 2) select the most effective treatments, 3) monitor treatment response, and 4) determine when treatment has restored physiologic stability and can be stopped. We will also determine the smallest number and types of parameters coupled to the longest CRI lead time to achieve the above four targets with the best sensitivity and specificity (a concept we call Monitoring Parsimony).We will simultaneously iteratively design and test a graphical user interface (GUI) and clinical decision support system (CDSS) driven by these parsimoniously derived predictive smart alerts and functional hemodynamic monitoring treatment approaches in two human simulation environments (PITT & UC Irvine).We envision a basic monitoring surveillance that identifies patients most likely to develop CRI to apply focused clinician attention and targeted treatments to deliver highly personalized medical care. Public Health Narrative If one could accurately predict who, when and why patients develop shock then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve outcome and more effectively use healthcare resources. But signs of shock often occur late once organ injury is already present. The purpose of this study is to first develop multivariable models through data-driven classification techniques to parsimoniously predict cardiovascular insufficiency, etiology and response to treatment. We will do this first in our existing MIMIC II clinical data sets of 4200 ICU patients as to timing and types of instability. Then we will prospectively collect real time high- density data on patients admitted to our trauma intensive care units of University of Pittsburgh, UC Irvine and UC San Diego. We will create and test in simulators of ICU care bedside user interfaces to drive recognition and treatment algorithms based on these models in all three medical centers.",Machine learning of physiological variables to predict diagnose and treat cardiorespiratory instability,9247214,R01GM117622,"['Algorithms ', ' Animals ', ' Attention ', ' California ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardio-vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Critically Ill ', ' Critical Illness ', ' Data Collection ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' hemodynamics ', ' blood loss ', ' Bleeding ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Physiological Homeostasis ', ' Autoregulation ', ' Homeostasis ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Intensive Care Units ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Libraries ', ' Physiologic Monitoring ', ' Physiological Monitoring ', ' mortality ', ' Pathologic Processes ', ' Pathological Processes ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Recommendation ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resuscitation ', ' Risk ', ' Running ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Shock ', ' circulatory shock ', ' Circulatory Collapse ', ' Hemorrhagic Shock ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Specificity ', ' Stress ', ' Family suidae ', ' suid ', ' porcine ', ' Swine ', ' Suidae ', ' Pigs ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Triage ', ' Universities ', ' Weaning ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' forest ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Normal Values ', ' Normal Range ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' density ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' mechanical respiratory assist ', ' Mechanical ventilation ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Refractory ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Medical ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Entropy ', ' Principal Component Analysis ', ' Principal Component Analyses ', ' Hour ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Stream ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Clinical Decision Support Systems ', ' Hypovolemia ', ' Medical center ', ' diagnostic accuracy ', ' Accuracy of Diagnosis ', ' Biological Neural Networks ', ' neural network ', ' simulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Organ failure ', ' computerized data processing ', ' data processing ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' fitness ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Clinical Data ', ' trial treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Perioperative ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' early onset ', ' cost ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' bloodstream infection ', ' blood infection ', ' Sepsis ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' prospective ', ' Trauma ', ' Coupled ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' graphical user interface ', ' graphic user interface ', ' Graphical interface ', ' iterative design ', ' prototype ', ' high risk ', ' clinical care ', ' patient population ', ' treatment response ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' database structure ', ' data base structure ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' support tools ', ' improved outcome ', ' predictive tools ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,598066,PA-18,-0.035718232072422765
"Artificial Intelligence in a Mobile Intervention for Depression (AIM) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary aim of this proposal is to develop and evaluate the use of state of the art machine learning approaches within a mobile intervention application for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). Machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, focuses on the development of algorithms that automatically improve and evolve based on collected data. Machine learning models can learn to detect complex, latent patterns in data and apply such knowledge to decision making in real time. The proposed intervention, called IntelliCare, will use ongoing data collected from the patient and intervention application to continuously adapt intervention content, content form, and motivational messaging to create a highly tailored and user-responsive treatment system. Behavioral intervention technologies (BITs), including web-based and mobile interventions, have been developed and are increasingly being used to treat MDD. BITs are moderately effective in treating depression, particularly when guided by human coaching via email or telephone. However, lack of personalization and inability to adapt to patient needs or preferences, which results in a perceived lack of relevance, contributes to poorer adherence and outcomes. IntelliCare will be designed as a mobile application, but will be accessible via computer web browsers and tablets. The IntelliCare machine learning framework will use individual data obtained from use data (e.g., length of time using a treatment component), embedded sensors in the phone (e.g., GPS), and the user's self-reports (e.g., ""like"" and usefulness ratings of treatment components) to provide a highly tailored intervention that can learn from the patient and adapt intervention and motivational materials to the patient's preferences and state. Low intensity coaching will serve as a backstop to support adherence. This project will contain three phases.  Phase 1 will involve the development of IntelliCare and its optimization through usability testing.  Phase 2 will be a field trial of 200 users who will receive IntelliCare for 12 weeks. The field trial has two aims: first to complete usability testing and optimization of the treatment framework, and second to develop the machine learning models and algorithms. Phase 3 will subject IntelliCare to a double blind, randomized controlled trial, comparing it to MobilCare. MobilCare will be identical to IntelliCare except that it will use standard presentation and presentation, rather than machine learning, to provide treatment and motivational materials. We will recruit half the participants from primary care settings, as this is the de facto site for treatment of depression in the United States, and half through the Internet, which is the main portal to health apps. The application of adaptive machine learning analytics to a mobile intervention has the potential to create a new generation of BITs that could revolutionize the way that such interventions are conceptualized, designed, and deployed. These innovations would have broad consequences and could be extended a broader range of BITS, including web- based interventions, and to other interventions targeting a wide range of health and mental health problems. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will create and evaluate IntelliCare, a mobile intervention also accessible by web browser, for depression. IntelliCare will harness modern adaptive machine learning analytics that can learn from a user's activity on the application, embedded phone sensors, and patient report to tailor intervention elements and motivational messaging to the needs and preferences of the user. This unprecedented level of tailoring could revolutionize the way such interventions are conceptualized, designed, and deployed.",Artificial Intelligence in a Mobile Intervention for Depression (AIM),9314333,R01MH100482,"['post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' Aftercare ', ' Algorithms ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Australia ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Computers ', ' Decision Making ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Double-Masked Study ', ' Double-Masked Method ', ' Double-Blinded ', ' Double-Blind Study ', ' Double-Blind Method ', ' electronic communication ', ' Email ', ' E-Mail ', ' Electronic Mail ', ' Elements ', ' employee assistance program ', ' Employee Assistance Program (Health Care) ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Modernization ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Motivation ', ' Online Systems ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Patients ', ' Phonation ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Public Health ', ' Recommendation ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Tablets ', ' Technology ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Textiles ', ' fabric ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Veterans Administration ', ' United States Veterans Administration ', ' United States Department of Veterans Affairs ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Mediating ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Phase ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Individual ', ' satisfaction ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Knowledge ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' preference ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Car Phone ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' major depression disorder ', ' major depression ', ' clinical depression ', ' Length ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cost ', ' care systems ', ' time use ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' psychopharmacologic ', ' psychopharmacological ', ' web-enabled ', ' web-accessible ', ' tailored messaging ', ' usability ', ' trial comparing ', ' treatment site ', ' public health relevance ', ' primary care setting ', ' secondary outcome ', ' Secure ', ' mobile application ', ' mobile app ', ' individualized medicine ', ' unique treatment ', ' tailored treatment ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' individualized treatment ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' customized treatment ', ' customized therapy ', ' depressed patient ', ' learning progression ', ' continuous learning ', ' Android ', ' ']",NIMH,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2017,593935,IL-07,-0.00803044776946765
"Enabling Technology for Safe Robot-assisted Surgical Micromanipulation Project Summary  The goal of this grant is to develop enabling technology and systems that address fundamental limitations in microsurgery with a specific focus on vitreoretinal surgery. Due to the inherent micro-scale and the fragility of the neurosensory retina, vitreoretinal surgeons can be challenged by physiological hand tremor where the tremor amplitude is larger than retinal structures, delicate movements that are below tactile sensation, and multiple cognitive decisions that are required when executing high-risk movements, such as during retinal vein cannulation (RVC). Nevertheless currently vitreoretinal surgery is at the limits of human physiological performance and lacks the adequate technology that could further improve the technical performance. This situation is less than optimal and can significantly benefit from the recent advances in medical robotics, sensor feedback and human machine interface design. Robotic assistance may be ideally suited to address common problems encountered in the performance of the demanding micromanipulations in retinal microsurgery.  We propose a robotic system with enhanced real-time multisensory feedback that assesses multiple points of instrument contact located both inside and outside of the eye. Our comprehensive system will enable the surgeon to manipulate tools based on quantitative feedback that will prevent mechanical injury by implementing safeguards against the application of excessive and previously unmeasurable forces at the eyewall and the tool tip. Our aims are: (1) Develop and demonstrate in vivo position/force hybrid control algorithms for enabling real- time high-fidelity sensorimotor capabilities at the sclerotomy for safe robot-assisted vitreoretinal microsurgery: real-time sensorimotor capabilities at the sclerotomy will be uniquely used to control the robot through a machine learning method that adaptively learns a nonlinear mapping from user behavior to sclera-force/position and predicts unsafe motions; (2) Develop and demonstrate in vivo force-input control algorithms for enabling real- time high-fidelity sensorimotor capabilities at the tool-tip for safe robot-assisted vein cannulation: real-time tool- tip-to-tissue interaction force sensing and non-linear robot control algorithms based on observing the user behavior will be used to control the tool-tip position and force and to prevent entry into subretinal areas during RVC; (3) Demonstrate safe robot-assisted RVC in rabbit model in vivo: real-time, position/force hybrid control algorithms based on dual-point (tool-shaft and tip) information fusion will provide sensorimotor guidance of surgical maneuvers during RVC. Statistically significant results in vivo, in clinically realistic conditions will demonstrate the feasibility of our approach.  This highly innovative system will enable surgeons to perform maneuvers in a tremor free environment with a higher level of precision than previously possible and with the ability to sense forces on a scale that have been previously imperceptible. We envision this development as a logical next step in the integration of man, machine and computer for the performance of unprecedented microsurgical maneuvers. Project Narrative  This R01 grant addresses fundamental limitations in current microsurgical practice, focusing on vitreoretinal surgery (VRS), which is the most technically demanding ophthalmologic surgery. Our goal is to develop a cooperatively controlled robotic system with enhanced sensorimotor capabilities that in conjunction with multifunction force-sensing microsurgical instruments could enable safe robot-assisted retinal surgery. Although focused on VRS, our results will be applicable to a broader range of microsurgical training and practice.",Enabling Technology for Safe Robot-assisted Surgical Micromanipulation,9291018,R01EB023943,"['Algorithms ', ' Behavior ', ' Computers ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Environment ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye ', ' Eye Movements ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Hand ', ' blood loss ', ' Bleeding ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Histology ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Hybrids ', ' Learning ', ' Manuals ', ' Micromanipulation ', ' Microsurgery ', ' Miniaturization ', ' Miniaturisations ', ' Motion ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' neurosurgery ', ' Ophthalmology ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Postoperative Period ', ' Postoperative ', ' Post-Operative ', ' Oryctolagus cuniculus ', ' Rabbits Mammals ', ' Rabbits ', ' Domestic Rabbit ', ' Research ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Retina ', ' Retinal Hemorrhage ', ' retina hemorrhage ', ' Retinal Perforations ', ' Retinal Tears ', ' Retinal Holes ', ' Retinal Dialyses ', ' Retinal Breaks ', ' Structure of central vein of the retina ', ' Retinal Vein ', ' Central Retinal Vein ', ' Retinal Vein Occlusion ', ' Robotics ', ' Safety ', ' Sclera ', ' White of Eye ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Ophthalmologic Surgical Procedures ', ' eye surgery ', ' Ophthalmological Surgical Procedures ', ' Ophthalmological Surgery ', ' Otorhinolaryngologic Surgical Procedures ', ' otorhinolaryngologic surgery ', ' otolaryngologic surgery ', ' Otorhinolaryngological Surgical Procedures ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tremor ', ' man machine interface ', ' human machine interface ', ' human computer interface ', ' User-Computer Interface ', ' Veins ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' Work ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' Robot ', ' tool ', ' instrument ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Mechanics ', ' mechanical ', ' Tactile ', ' Clinic ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' interest ', ' Surgeon ', ' Performance ', ' Structure ', ' technological innovation ', ' Reporting ', ' Touch sensation ', ' tactile sensation ', ' Touch ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Property ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Cannulations ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Iatrogenesis ', ' iatrogenicity ', ' iatrogenically ', ' iatrogenic ', ' in vivo ', ' in vivo Model ', ' clinical test ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Cognitive ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' virtual ', ' robotic assistance ', ' robot assisted ', ' robot assistance ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Retinal ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' man ', "" man's "", ' high risk ', ' multisensory ', ' Sterilization ', ' operation ', ' dexterity ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' adaptive learning ', ' robot control ', ' robotic control ', ' neurosensory ', ' neuro-sensory ', ' ']",NIBIB,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,305007,MD-07,-0.004975250767985481
"Slicer+PLUS: Collaborative, open-source software for ultrasound analysis Abstract The target users of the proposed Slicer+PLUS framework are researchers and developers who are focusing on low-cost point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) applications. POCUS applications are characterized by utilizing low-cost, portable U/S systems; in the hands of novice operators; with novel data acquisition, signal processing, and machine learning methods; with imprecise trackers; and in highly unconstrained point-of-care environments, e.g.: at the scene of accidents for patient triage, in the offices of general practitioners for scoliosis detection and monitoring, in patients' homes for an aging population, as well as throughout hospitals. In these contexts, many are considering POCUS devices to be the stethoscopes of the future.  The foundation of Slicer+PLUS is the integration and extension of 3D Slicer, PLUS, and MUSiiC. We are the developers of these libraries. We, and the users of our libraries, are proposing Slicer+PLUS so that the Slicer, PLUS, and MUSiiC communities can come together and cohesively address the important challenges and opportunities posed by POCUS applications. Over 30 letters of support are included with this application.  3D Slicer is a world-class, freely available open-source platform for medical image segmentation, registration, and visualization. PLUS is a world-class, open-source library for communicating with ultrasound machines and trackers (for following objects in 3D using magnetic, optical, and other technologies). MUSiiC is a (previously closed source) library that focuses on advanced ultrasound acquisition and analysis methods, such as ultrasound reconstruction pipelines, elastography, and photoacoustic imaging. Together, these toolkits have averaged over 5,100 downloads per month for the past year.  A central tenant of our work is that POCUS applications should not be viewed as simply involving the use of inexpensive, portable U/S systems; POCUS must be viewed as a new modality for it to attain its full potential. POCUS must involve innovative, automated data analysis methods and workflows that can guide a user to properly place and manipulate an ultrasound probe and interpret the returned ultrasound data. In particular, the output of those workflows and analyses should be quantitative measures, not b-mode images, since the expertise to interpret such images will not be readily available at points-of-care. To that end, the proposed work goes well beyond simple integration of Slicer, PLUS, and MUSiiC. Multiple innovations are proposed such as Ultrasound Spectroscopy for tissue labeling, Dynamic Textures for anatomic localization of ultrasound probes, and self-tracking ultrasound probes.  To assess our progress towards our goals, our team includes our target users: researchers, medical device manufacturers, and clinical innovators dedicated to low-cost POCUS applications. They will be validating our efforts by integrating them into their research and translational POCUS product development projects. Project Narrative  Low-cost ultrasound probes have the potential to become the stethoscopes of the future and revolutionize in-field and in-hospital patient care. Our goal is to integrate, enhance, and disseminate three cutting edge ultrasound acquisition, analysis, and display toolkits to create a new framework called Slicer+PLUS that will serve as a catalyst for research and product development into low-cost point-of-care ultrasound applications. In particular, our framework will include and facilitate innovative methods for guiding a novice user in ultrasound probe placement and for automatically interpreting ultrasound data to provide a diagnosis, without the user having to interpret a traditional B-mode ultrasound image at any point in the process. The Slicer+PLUS framework will be validated using tasks associated with (a) emergency service personnel performing Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) exams at the scene of an accident to detect or rule-out intra-abdominal bleeding; (b) the clinical monitoring of scoliosis progression in children in general practitioners' offices; and (c) the translation of research into regulatory-approved products based on Slicer+PLUS.","Slicer+PLUS: Collaborative, open-source software for ultrasound analysis",9355633,R01EB021396,"['Abdominal ', ' Abdomen ', ' Accidents ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomy ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Communities ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Diagnosis ', ' emergency service ', ' Emergency medical service ', ' Environment ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Generalists ', ' General Practitioners ', ' Goals ', ' blood loss ', ' Bleeding ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Hospitals ', ' Libraries ', ' Medical Device ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Patients ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Support ', ' scoliosis ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Spectrum Analysis ', ' Spectrum Analyses ', ' Spectroscopy ', ' Vertebral column ', ' backbone ', ' Spine ', ' Spinal Column ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' ultrasound scanning ', ' ultrasound imaging ', ' ultrasound ', ' sound measurement ', ' sonography ', ' sonogram ', ' diagnostic ultrasound ', ' Ultrasound Test ', ' Ultrasound Medical Imaging ', ' Ultrasound Diagnosis ', ' Ultrasonogram ', ' Ultrasonic Imaging ', ' Medical Ultrasound ', ' Echotomography ', ' Echography ', ' Ultrasonography ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Visualization ', ' Imagery ', ' catalyst ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' Stethoscopes ', ' Clinical ', ' Letters ', ' Shapes ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Life ', ' Frequencies ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Source ', ' Texture ', ' System ', ' Magnetism ', ' magnetic ', ' innovative technologies ', ' hospital patient care ', ' cohesion ', ' novel ', ' Modality ', ' Devices ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' software development ', ' developing computer software ', ' develop software ', ' portability ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Documentation ', ' Manufacturer Name ', ' Manufacturer ', ' image guided therapy ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Intra-abdominal ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research ', ' Monitor ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' point of care ', ' first responder ', ' emergency service responder ', ' emergency service personnel ', ' Emergency responder ', ' emergency service/first responder ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Output ', ' cost ', ' reconstruction ', ' 3D analysis ', ' 3-dimensional analysis ', ' 3-D analysis ', ' Three-dimensional analysis ', ' Trauma ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' imaging Segmentation ', ' data acquisition ', ' open source ', ' aging population ', ' population aging ', ' aged population ', ' product development ', ' photoacoustic imaging ', ' optoacoustic imaging ', ' elastography ', ' signal processing ', ' Patient Triage ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' clinical translation ', ' ']",NIBIB,"KITWARE, INC.",R01,2017,554865,NY-20,0.04734912538163165
"Development and Evaluation of a Learning Electronic Medical Record System ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of this project to develop and evaluate a learning electronic medical records (L-EMR) system that draws a physician's attention to the right data, at the right time. It learns how to do so by analyzing patterns of patient data access f many physicians in many past cases in the EMR, and learning which EMR data to highlight that are relevant for making clinical decisions in a given patient.      The hypothesis underlying this research is that the L-EMR system will have sufficiently high precision and recall in highlighting relevant data, decrease the average time to assess an intensive care unit (ICU) patient case, and be judged by critical care medicine (CCM) physicians to be clinically useful.    The first aim of this project is develop a highly-usable L-EMR user interface. The L-EMR user interface will include zoomable time-series displays of lab-results, med-orders, and vital signs. Usability studies of the L-EMR user interface will guide revisions and enhancements.      The second aim of the project is to train statistical models that can be applied to a patient case to predict relevant lab-results, med-orders, and vital signs. We will enlist CCM physicians to review a set of retrospective ICU patient cases on a focused set of clinical conditions. Participants will review these cases as if they were active patients, identifying relevant lab- results, med-orders, and vital signs. We will train and evaluate statistical models to predict relevant data, and identify the best performing algorithm to include in the L-EMR system.      The third aim of the project is to evaluate the L-EMR system. We will recruit CCM physicians to evaluate an L-EMR system based on user interfaces from Aim 1 and statistical models trained using the best performing algorithm in Aim 2 to highlight relevant data items. We will measure the precision and recall of the data-highlighting functionality for assessing patient cases and making clinical decisions (e.g., lab and medication orders), the time required to assess cases with and without the highlighting, and physicians' assessments of the strengths and weaknesses of the L-EMR system.    If the results of these experiments are positive, as anticipated, this project will introduce a computational method that has significant potential to improve future EMR systems and enhance patient care. Narrative The purpose of this research is to develop and evaluate a learning electronic medical records (EMR) system that draws a physician's attention to the right data, at the right time. The system works by analyzing patterns of EMR usage of physicians, and learning which EMR data to highlight that are relevant in a given patient. The main idea underlying the approach is that patterns of past EMR usage patterns can be exploited to selectively highlight clinically useful patient data.",Development and Evaluation of a Learning Electronic Medical Record System,9297355,R01LM012095,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Algorithms ', ' Attention ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' web-based training ', ' web-based instruction ', ' virtual learning ', ' virtual education ', ' technology-enhanced learning ', ' online learning ', ' online education ', ' multimedia learning ', ' internet-based training ', ' internet-assisted education ', ' electronic learning ', ' eLearning ', ' digital learning ', ' digital education ', ' computer-based training ', ' computer-based learning ', ' computer-based instruction ', ' computer-based education ', ' computer-assisted instruction ', ' E-learning ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' Critical Care ', ' Critically Ill ', ' Critical Illness ', ' Data Display ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Future ', ' gastrointestinal bleeding ', ' GI hemorrhage ', ' GI bleeding ', ' Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Goals ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Hemoglobin ', ' Information Systems ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Intensive Care Units ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Measures ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' man-machine interaction ', ' computer human interaction ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Series ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Measurement ', ' Intravenous ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Medical Errors ', ' Medical Mistakes ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Test Result ', ' American ', ' Participant ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Clinical Management ', ' clinical test ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' research clinical testing ', ' trend ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' prospective ', ' usability ', ' stem ', ' prototype ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' Bayesian Modeling ', ' Bayesian tracking algorithms ', ' Bayesian statistical models ', ' Bayesian spatial models ', ' Bayesian spatial image models ', ' Bayesian spatial data model ', ' Bayesian nonparametric models ', ' Bayesian network model ', ' Bayesian hierarchical model ', ' Bayesian framework ', ' Bayesian belief updating model ', ' Bayesian belief network ', ' Bayesian adaptive models ', ' Bayesian adaptive designs ', ' data access ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' ']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,444581,PA-18,0.00774797562764427
"The Blackfynn Platform for Rapid Data Integration and Collaboration Summary One in seven people worldwide suffers from a brain disorder, e.g., epilepsy, Parkinson's, stroke, or dementia. Development of future treatments depends on improving our understanding of brain function and disease, and validating new treatments critically depends on identifying the underlying biomarkers associated with different conditions. Biomarker discovery requires volume, quality, richness, and diversity of data. This Direct-to-Phase II project extends Blackfynn's cloud data management platform for team science, in order to support interactive data curation and integration and to facilitate biomarker discovery. Our first technical aim develops tools to help select, curate, assess, and regularize datasets: we develop novel “live” query capabilities to ensure users discover relevant data, develop mechanisms for using data's provenance to decide on trustworthiness, and build tools for mapping fields to common data elements. These capabilities address the critical, under-served problem of selecting the data to analyze. Our second technical aim develops techniques for incorporating algorithms to link and co-register across multi-modal data and metadata. Using ranking and machine learning, we can incorporate and combine state-of-the-art algorithms for finding data relationships, and we can link to remote data sources. These capabilities enable scientists to analyze richer datasets with multiple data modalities and properties – thus enabling them to discover more complex correlations and biomarkers. In our third aim, Blackfynn's new technical capabilities will be applied to challenges faced by Blackfynn partners, including problems assessing trustworthiness of data annotations, conducting image analysis, modeling epileptic networks, and identifying biomarkers for neuro-oncology indications. As part of this validation we will also develop HIPAA-compliant mechanisms for working with protected and de-identified data together. Together, these three thrusts will ensure that development of the Blackfynn platform results in tools and technologies that meaningfully accelerate scientific understanding and discovery over rich and complex data, leading to improved treatments for neurologic disease.   Narrative This Direct-to-Phase II project extends the Blackfynn cloud data management platform to enable biomarker discovery for research and development of improved drugs, devices and clinical care for patients with neurologic disease: it develops tools for assembling, evaluating, and rating data, and linking it across modalities and to external systems.

"MHealth Monitoring of Acoustic and Behavioral Patterns in Bipolar Disorder Across Cultures Abstract: The ability to prioritize individuals for health care based on behavioral and acoustic patterns in speech will allow for efficient use of health care resources. The ability to predict mood states using daily monitoring of acoustics derived from mobile technology provides the basis for a real-time proxy measure of moods and affective states. Identification and monitoring of these and other dimensional features of human disease is the base for anticipating outcomes, offering the future possibility of timely and mitigating interventions. Technological and mHealth methods are well suited for the global health community due to the flexibility and adaptability of the approach; the capacity to reach large numbers of patients can be easily amplified with modest increase in infrastructure. We have developed an accurate prediction model for mood states in bipolar (BP) individuals using machine-learning strategies and established a process that involves preprocessing, feature extraction, and an integrated data analysis of clinical and acoustic data gathered from personal use of a mobile device for up to one year. The results show mood states are predicted with an AUC statistic of 0.74 (mania) and 0.77 (depression). We hypothesize that analyses across cultures will identify common features of illness that can be identified using our methods. BP is ideal for study because of the wide range of mood states and temperamental traits. This study aims to 1) ascertain 30 individuals with BP and 10 healthy controls from Lebanon and a multilingual community in SE Michigan, recording daily acoustic and behavioral data using a smart-phone, all outgoing speech from the device is gathered and all personal digital activity is recorded from the device. We propose to study participants in Lebanon and SE Michigan in order to identify the fundamental acoustic elements of mood variation among bipolar patients. 2) apply integrated computational analyses using static (Gaussian Mixture Models and Support Vector Machines) and dynamic (Hidden Markov Models) modeling of categorical, dimensional and derived features from clinical, acoustic, and behavioral signals; we will compare data from the 15 BP from Lebanon and 15 BP from SE Michigan that have been resident in USA >2 years but originate from a geographical region comparable to Lebanon in language and culture, and 15 American born BP Caucasians (from our current cohort). Our hypothesis is that there are fundamental elements of acoustics that associate with mood states regardless of the culture. The impact is the longitudinal use of mobile technology to passively gather personal data to establish computational models that use extensive individual state and trait data to accurately predict mood and health states. This provides a foundation for predictive modeling that can be integrated into subsequent clinical interventional studies to predict and test causal effects of specific interventions on disease mechanisms. Expertise in clinical, computational, and technology disciplines form the team to realize these goals. This is a study that focuses on the ability of technological methods to detect speech and behavioral patterns in patients with bipolar disorder across cultural boundaries to identify common features that predict mood states. The overall goal is to use computational methods for the early detection of affect and mood changes that will provide the opportunity to monitor mood disorders using common methods regardless of cultural differences.",MHealth Monitoring of Acoustic and Behavioral Patterns in Bipolar Disorder Across Cultures,9340389,R21MH114835,"['Databases ', ' Immigrant ', ' Arabs ', ' Multilingualism ', ' tool ', ' Manic ', ' Manic State ', ' Manias ', ' Depressed mood ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' cognitive function ', ' Dimensions ', ' Severities ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Pattern ', ' Country ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' American ', ' data management ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' cohort ', ' trait ', ' Proxy ', ' Participant ', ' Categories ', ' Devices ', ' Health Technology ', ' Health Care Technology ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Address ', ' global health ', ' Symptoms ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' computer analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computational analyses ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' Pathologic ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Community Health ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' meta data ', ' Metadata ', ' digital ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Social Functioning ', ' markov model ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Impairment ', ' Affective ', ' human disease ', ' lexical processing ', ' lexical ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' mobile device ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' Secure ', ' Bipolar I ', ' Bipolar 1 ', ' mHealth ', ' mobile health ', ' m-Health ', ' Patient Triage ', ' bipolar patients ', ' health data ', ' Gaussian model ', ' Gaussianity model ', ' Gaussianity ', ' Gaussian statistics ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' mobile computing ', ' mobile technology ', ' mobile platform ', ' low and middle-income countries ', ' LMIC ', ' Acoustic ', ' Acoustics ', ' Affect ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' Communities ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Elements ', ' Emotions ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' geographic site ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Immigration ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Interview ', ' Language ', ' Lebanon ', ' Locales ', ' Methods ', ' Michigan ', ' Middle East ', ' Moods ', ' Patients ', ' Phonation ', ' Probability ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Safety ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Speech ', ' Supervision ', ' Technology ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Temperament ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasians ', ' Measures ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' psychiatric treatment ', ' psychiatric therapy ', ' psychiatric care ', ' Psychiatric therapeutic procedure ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R21,2017,172643,MI-12,-0.056218837026382126
"iFACS: Imaging Florescence Activated Cell Sorter to sort cells based on images iFACS: Imaging Florescence Activated Cell Sorter to sort cells based on images NanoCellect Biomedical, Inc. RESEARCH & RELATED Other Project Information 7. PROJECT SUMMARY Advances in reagents (e.g. CRiSPR) and analytical tools (e.g. flow cytometers) have improved the ability to alter and characterize cellular phenotypes. Ultimately, many key applications in biomedicine require efficient and accurate isolation of cell populations according to features contained in high content images. Unfortunately, microscopic laser microdissection systems have a throughput that is too slow to be practical in many applications; while the existing flow cytometers that can sort cells (fluorescence-activated cell sorters or FACS) provide only size, internal complexity, and fluorescence intensity information and lack the rich data of imaging. Another critical limitation is that the existing flow cytometers that can image, cannot sort cells. NanoCellect has made a highly affordable FACS to increase access to this important high-throughput tool for cell analysis. Here we propose to enhance our existing low-cost FACS with the ability to image cells and sort them based on image features. This will allow users to pursue new strategies in drug screening and mechanism of action research; as well as work with suspension cell lines, such as those that dominate the recent advances in immuno-oncology. In Phase I research, we have demonstrated the world's first imaging flow cytometer with cell sorting capabilities (iFACS) in a unique design of space-time coding with an optical spatial filter. The approach adds negligible cost to the system for the desirable features of cell imaging and sorting. To fully realize the enormous potential of the design and to meet the demands for most applications, in Phase II we will develop high-throughput image-based cell sorting with innovative image-guided gating schemes supported by machine learning and interactive user/machine interface. Essentially, image-based flow cytometry gating uses similar cell isolation criteria as the techniques of laser capture microdissection or cell aspiration to isolate cells of interest, with 10,000X throughput improvements to 1000+ cells per second. We envision such unique capabilities will become common, default features for tomorrow's users as the tool becomes as intuitive and ubiquitous as fluorescent microscopy. The proposed iFACS will be transformative and benefit numerous biomedical applications, such as isolation of cells based on organelle translocation, cell cycle analyses, detection and counting of phagocytosed particles, and protein co-localization, to name just a few. iFACS: Imaging Florescence Activated Cell Sorter to sort cells based on images NanoCellect Biomedical, Inc.

"Semantic Data Lake for Biomedical Research Capitalizing on the transformative opportunities afforded by the extremely large and ever-growing volume, velocity, and variety of biomedical data being continuously produced is a major challenge. The development and increasingly widespread adoption of several new technologies, including next generation genetic sequencing, electronic health records and clinical trials systems, and research data warehouses means that we are in the midst of a veritable explosion in data production. This in turn results in the migration of the bottleneck in scientific productivity into data management and interpretation: tools are urgently needed to assist cancer researchers in the assembly, integration, transformation, and analysis of these Big Data sets. In this project, we propose to develop the Semantic Data Lake for Biomedical Research (SDL-BR) system, a cluster-computing software environment that enables rapid data ingestion, multifaceted data modeling, logical and semantic querying and data transformation, and intelligent resource discovery. SDL-BR is based on the idea of a data lake, a distributed store that does not make any assumptions about the structure of incoming data, and that delays modeling decisions until data is to be used. This project adds to the data lake paradigm methods for semantic data modeling, integration, and querying, and for resource discovery based on learned relationships between users and data resources. The SDL-BR System is a distributed computing software solution that enables research institutions to manage, integrate, and make available large institutional data sets to researchers, and that permits users to generate data models specific to particular applications. It uses state of the art cluster computing, Semantic Web, and machine learning technologies to provide for rapid data ingestion, semantic modeling and querying, and search and discovery of data resources through a sophisticated, Web-based user interface.",Semantic Data Lake for Biomedical Research,9536289,R44CA206782,"['Adoption ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' nonsmall cell lung cancer ', ' Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ', ' NSCLC - Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ', ' NSCLC ', ' Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Collection ', ' Data Sources ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Environment ', ' Explosion ', ' genetic biomarker ', ' Genetic Markers ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' indexing ', ' Chronic Myeloid Leukemia ', ' Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia ', ' Chronic Myelocytic Leukemia ', ' Chronic Granulocytic Leukemia ', ' melanoma ', ' Malignant Melanoma ', ' Methods ', ' Online Systems ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Legal patent ', ' Patents ', ' Production ', ' Productivity ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Semantics ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Vocabulary Words ', ' Vocabulary ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Phase ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Ingestion ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Data Quality ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Liquid substance ', ' liquid ', ' fluid ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Catalogs ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Services ', ' data management ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Informatics ', ' technology development ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Modeling ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Institution ', ' Legal ', ' Address ', ' Biomedical Computing ', ' biomedical computation ', ' Data ', ' Retrieval ', ' Collection ', ' Ontology ', ' Security ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' systems research ', ' time use ', ' semantic web ', ' computer based Semantic Analysis ', ' data modeling ', ' Knowledge Extraction ', ' data integration ', ' distributed computing ', ' datagrid ', ' data grid ', ' cluster computing ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' next generation ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' migration ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' mobile device ', ' prototype ', ' data exchange ', ' data transmission ', ' natural language ', ' clinical data warehouse ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Secure ', ' High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing ', ' High-Throughput Sequencing ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' precision medicine ', ' individualized medicine ', ' unique treatment ', ' tailored treatment ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' individualized treatment ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' customized treatment ', ' customized therapy ', ' Precision therapeutics ', ' precision treatment ', ' precision therapies ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted therapy ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' genetic information ', ' Data Science ', ' Data Scientist ', ' Data Discovery ', ' Data Analytics ', ' Accelerometer ', ' activity tracker ', ' activity monitor ', ' accelerometry ', ' disease heterogeneity ', ' data access ', ' data resource ', ' ']",NCI,"INFOTECH SOFT, INC.",R44,2017,589741,FL-27,0.0002151833908344095
"LifeSense: Transforming Behavioral Assessment of Depression Using Personal Sensing Technology Abstract Depression is common, costly, and a leading cause of disability. Assessment of behavior and experience related to depression has tended to rely on self-report and interview-based methods. Environmental momentary assessment inserts assessment into people's lives, but still requires active engagement by those being evaluated. We propose to develop and validate a mobile phone-based personal sensing system to detect depression and related behaviors that relies on sensor data that are collected continuously and unobtrusively. Because people tend to keep their phones with them, the mobile phone is an ideal sensing platform, as it can continuously collect data in the context of the individual's life with no ongoing effort on the part of the user. Such systems are already being used to detect simple behaviors, such as activity recognition and sleep quantification, which are more proximal to the sensor data. Aim 1 will develop markers for a broad range of behavioral targets related to symptoms of major depressive episode (MDE; anhedonia, negative mood, sleep disruption, psychomotor activity, fatigue, and diminished concentration) and related domains (e.g. social functioning, stress, motivation) across a representative sample of participants. Aim 2 will combine all behavioral targets using machine learning to 1) estimate MDE and symptom severity cross-sectionally, 2) identify transition from non-depressed to depressed states, and depressed to non-depressed states, and 3) predict MDE and symptom severity 4 and 8 weeks out. Aim 3 will seek to understand the complex relationships among behavioral targets and depression. We will accomplish this by enrolling 1200 representative participants, in six 4-month waves of data collection. Each participant will download software that collects a wide variety of sensor data (GPS, accelerometry, light, Bluetooth, phone usage, etc.) and an app that collects ecological momentary assessments (EMA). Following each wave we will develop algorithms for a subset of behavioral targets and features (a definition of raw sensor data that incorporates meaning, like translating GPS data into “home”). Each algorithm will then be validated in the subsequent wave. After 5 waves (1000 participants), the set of all markers of behavioral targets and features will be combined using machine learning to detect and predict depression. This hierarchical approach extracts information from data at multiple levels, which ultimately is far more likely to succeed than relying solely on raw sensor data. The final wave will serve to replicate and validate the entire depression prediction model. This sensing platform is scientifically significant, as it will provide a fundamentally new tool for obtaining continuous, objective markers of behavior that are relevant to depression, as well as many other psychiatric and medical disorders. This project has the potential develop new understandings into the etiology of depression. It is clinically significant, as it will allow for continuous, effortless assessment of populations at risk for depression and ongoing evaluation during treatment. Project Narrative We propose to develop a sensing platform that uses mobile phone sensor data to detect a broad range of behaviors related to depression, as well as detect and predict depressive states that require treatment. This system will be able to run unobtrusively and continuously on people's phones. This sensing platform will provide a fundamentally new method of obtaining continuous, objective markers of behavior that are relevant to depression, as well as many other psychiatric and medical disorders.",LifeSense: Transforming Behavioral Assessment of Depression Using Personal Sensing Technology,9379995,R01MH111610,"['Algorithms ', ' Behavior ', ' Sampling Biases ', ' Systematic Bias ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Data Collection ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Fatigue ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Human Activities ', ' Interview ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' single episode major depressive disorder ', ' single episode Major Depression ', ' major depressive episode ', ' Single major depressive episode ', ' Single major depression ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Motivation ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Persons ', ' Noise ', ' Periodicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Phonation ', ' Psychologist ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Rewards ', ' Running ', ' Sleep ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Stress ', ' Technology ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Textiles ', ' fabric ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Measures ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Anhedonia ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Evaluation ', ' disability ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Measurement ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Depressed mood ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Life ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' computer science ', ' Structure ', ' pleasure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Devices ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Genomics ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Car Phone ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Behavior assessment ', ' behavioral assessment ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Collection ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Monitor ', ' Text ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' Social Functioning ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' next generation ', ' touchscreen panel ', ' touch screen panel ', ' touch screen ', ' touch panel ', ' touchscreen ', ' negative mood ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' health application ', ' wireless fidelity ', ' wi-fi ', ' treatment response ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' Accelerometer ', ' activity tracker ', ' activity monitor ', ' accelerometry ', ' ']",NIMH,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2017,822645,IL-07,-0.009940426045506871
"Capti Screen Reading Assistant for Goal Directed Web Browsing ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Web browsing with assistive technologies such as screen readers and magnifiers can often be a frustrating and challenging experience for people with vision impairments, because it entails a lot of searching for content, forms, and links that are required for doing online tasks such as shopping, bill-payment, reservations, etc. This SBIR Phase II project will build on Phase I results and will continue the development and eventual deployment of Capti Screen Reading Assistant - a next-generation assistive technology, enabling goal- directed web browsing for people with visual impairments. With Capti Assistant, users will be able to stay focused on their high-level browsing goals that are expressed in natural language (spoken or typed). The Assistant will lead the users step-by-step towards the fulfillment of these goals by offering suggestions on what action to take at every step of the way and automatically executing the chosen action on behalf of the user. Suggested actions will include operations such as form filling, activating controls (e.g., clicking buttons and links), et. Capti Assistant will dramatically reduce the time spent by people with visual impairments on performing tasks online. The Assistant will significantly improve the speed and efficiency with which they can interact with the Web, thereby, making people with disabilities more productive in today's web-based economy. Given a user browsing goal, expressed in a natural-language form, Capti Assistant will utilize a predictive model to guide the user toward the goal. The unique aspect of the Assistant is that its suggestions will be automatically learned from the user's own history of browsing actions and commands, as well as from the user's demonstration of how to accomplish browsing tasks that have not been done before. The Assistant will process user commands and present the suggested browsing actions to the user on demand, giving the user a choice between following the suggestions or continue browsing normally without accepting the suggestions. The functionality offered by the Assistant will go far beyond popular personal assistant applications such as Siri, which have not been designed specifically for people with vision impairments, and which cannot be used for ad hocweb browsing. Capti Assistant will go a long way towards bridging the growing web accessibility divide between the ways people with and without vision impairments browse the Web. For them, the Assistant will usher in a new era of independence and employability in our global web-based economy. Thus, from a broader perspective, goal- directed browsing will exemplify the vision of the Universally Accessible Web whose thesis is ""equal access for all"", i.e. anyone should be able to reap the benefits of the Web without being constrained by any disability. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This SBIR Project seeks to do Research and Development on goal-directed web browsing - the next generation accessible technology that will empower people with vision impairments to stay focused on their high-level browsing goals, while the browser will do low-level operations (such as clicking on links and filling forms) necessary to fulfill these goals. Goal-directed browsing will go a long way towards bridging the growing web accessibility divide between the ways people with and without vision impairments browse the web, thus improving independence and employability of the former in our global Web-based economy.

"CRCNS: The role of sound statistics for discrimination and coding of sounds ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Humans and other animals can discriminate and recognize sounds despite substantial acoustic variability in real-world sounds. This ability depends partly on the auditory system's ability to detect and utilize high-order statistical regularities that are present in the acoustic environment. Despite numerous advances in signal processing, assistive listening devices and speech recognition technologies lack biologically realistic strategies to dynamically deal with such acoustic variability. Thus, a comprehensive theory for how the central nervous system encodes and utilizes statistical structure in sounds is essential to develop processing strategies for sound recognition, coding and compression, and to assist individuals with hearing loss.     This proposal presents a novel approach towards addressing the question of how the auditory system deals with and exploits statistical regularities for identification and discrimination of sounds in two critical mammalian auditory structures (inferior colliculus, IC; auditory cortex, AC) Aim 1 is to develop a catalogue of natural and man-made sounds and their associated high-order statistics. Cluster analysis and machine learning will be applied to the sound ensembles to identify salient statistical features that can be used to identify and categorize sounds from a computational perspective. Using information theoretic and correlation based methods, Aim 2 tests the hypothesis that statistical sound regularities are encoded in neural response statistics, including firing rate and spike-timing statistics of IC and AC neurons. Aim 3 will determine neurometric response functions and addresses the hypothesis that high-order statistical regularities in sounds can be discriminated based on temporal pattern and firing rate statistics of single neurons in IC and AC. Aim 4 will employ multi-site recording electrode arrays to tests the hypothesis that neural populations in IC and AC use high-order statistics for sound discrimination and that statistical regularities are encoded by regionally distributed differences n the strength and timing of neural responses or neuron-to-neuron correlations.     The study will provide the groundwork for developing a general theory for how the brain encodes and discriminates sounds based on high-order statistical features. A catalogue of neural responses from single cells, neural ensembles, and high-level statistical features that differentiate real world sounds will be developed and deployed as an on-line resource. The role high-order statics play for sound recognition and discrimination will be identified both from a computational and neural coding perspective, including identifying transformations across neural structures, spatial and temporal scales.     The project will foster collaborations between psychology, electrical engineering, and biomedical engineering departments at the UConn. Graduate, undergraduate and a post-doctoral student, including women and minorities, will participate in the research and will receive interdisciplinary training in areas of neurophysiology, computation neuroscience, and engineering. Drs. Read and Escabi regularly host summer interns in their labs and expect that 1-2 undergraduate students will be hosted per year. Graduate students will be enrolled in biomedical, electrical engineering, and psychology programs. Project findings will be integrated in graduate computational neuroscience and biomedical engineering coursework.     The findings could lead to a host of new sound recognition technologies that make use of high-order statistical regularities to recognize and differentiate amongst sounds. Understanding how high-order statistics are represented in the brain could guide the development of optimal algorithms for detecting a target sound (e.g., speech) in variable/noisy conditions. Such sound recognition systems are also applicable in industrial applications: for instance, identifying fault machine systems from machine generated sounds. Knowledge of the statistical distributions in real world sounds and music will be useful for sound compression (e.g., mpeg coding) and to develop efficient sound processing algorithms. Finally, the findings can be incorporated in auditory prosthetics that mimic normal hearing physiology and make use of high-order sound statistics to remove background noise or enhance intelligibility.

"Pilot for Creating Reproducible Workflows Using Docker Containers for NIH Commons DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary goal of the proposed Center of Excellence is to build a powerful and scalable Knowledge Engine for Genomics, KnowEnG. KnowEnG will transform the way biomedical researchers analyze their genome-wide data by integrating multiple analytical methods derived from the most advanced data mining and machine learning research to use the full breadth of existing knowledge about the relationships between genes as background, and providing an intuitive and professionally designed user interface. In order to achieve these goals, the project includes the following components: (1) gathering and integrating existing knowledgebases documenting connections between genes and their functions into a single Knowledge Network; (2) developing computational methods for analyzing genome-wide user datasets in the context of this pre-existing knowledge; (3) implementing these methods into scalable software components that can be deployed in a public or private cloud; (4) designing and implementing a Web-based user interface, based on the HUBZero toolkit, that enables the interactive analysis of user-supplied datasets in a graphics-driven and intuitive fashion; (5) thoroughly testing the functionality and usefulness of the KnowEnG environment in three large scale projects in the clinical sciences (pharmacogenomics of breast cancer), behavioral sciences (identification of gene regulatory modules underlying behavioral patterns) and drug discovery (genome-based prediction of the capacity of microorganisms to synthesize novel biologically active compounds). The KnowEng environment will be deployed in a cloud infrastructure and fully available to the community, as will be the software developed by the Center. The proposed Center is a collaboration between the University of Illinois (UIUC), a recognized world leader in computational science and engineering, and the Mayo Clinic, one of the leading clinical care and research organizations in the world, and will be based at the UIUC Institute for Genomic Biology, which has state-of-the-art facilities and a nationally recognized program of multidisciplinary team-based genomic research.

"Clinical resting state fMRI software for surgical planning Abstract Classically, anatomic information provided by MRI has been essential to the neurosurgeon to maximize extent of tumor resection and, as a result, improve survival statistics. That said, it is not routine during resections to make use of similar imaging information that reflect the functional organization of the brain. Task-based fMRI has been employed as a means of pre-operatively localizing function. However, task-based fMRI depends on the patient’s ability to comply with the task paradigm, which frequently is lacking. This problem can be overcome by using the recently developed method of resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) to localize function. Moreover, rsfMRI is highly efficient, as multiple resting state networks (RSNs) associated with multiple cognitive domains can be mapped at the same time. With this in mind, the long-term goal of our research is to improve survival and quality of life after surgical resection of brain tumors by improving the identification/preservation of eloquent cortex. The current barrier that prevents the widespread use of rsfMRI is 1) the high degree of advanced imaging expertise currently necessary to create and interpret the images and 2) the necessary IT infrastructure necessary to support the analyses. To address this shortcoming, we propose to create a turnkey system for functional mapping within the brain that resides on a cloud-computing platform. At the heart of our methodology is a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) algorithm that assigns RSN membership to each locus within the brain using supervised classification of rsfMRI data. Current data demonstrate that MLP-based RSN mapping is more reliable than conventional task-based fMRI and is extremely sensitive to sites identified by cortical stimulation (the standard in intraoperative mapping). Translation of the science and techniques created at Washington University will be accomplished by a deep collaboration with Radiologics, an emerging company with strong expertise in cloud computing for clinical imaging. Towards this end, the overall objective of the proposed project is to create an imaging technology package, named Cirrus, that will integrate automatic MLP-based RSN mapping with cloud-based computing. The Specific Aims of this proposal are to 1) Create Cloud-Based rsfMRI Brain Mapping Capability - Cirrus, 2) Deploy Cloud-Based rsfMRI Capability (Cirrus Platform) to New User Host Institutions, and 3) Optimize the Clinical User Interface (UI) of Cirrus. The expected outcome of this translational strategy will be an integrated imaging/surgical presurgical mapping technology using rsfMRI with clearly defined performance capabilities, well delineated localization outputs, and a clinician friendly user experience that scales to all types of health care settings. Thus, this proposal is innovative because there currently does not exist any comparable system that integrates cutting edge image analysis tools with cloud-based capabilities. This work is significant because it will disseminate technology that fundamentally enhances the surgeon’s understanding of the functional implications of their surgical strategy, thereby enables safer, more tailored approaches to improving outcomes. Project Narrative The proposed research is an academic industry partnership that will make available, to any neurosurgical practice advanced functional MRI methodology to define critical regions in the brain. This development is relevant to public health because it has the potential to improve functional outcomes following surgical removal of brain tumors. Towards this end, we propose to create an imaging technology package that will integrate 1) advanced machine learning techniques using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging, and 2) cloud-based computing, to perform advanced brain mapping. Thus, advanced functional localization can be standardized and acquired at any institution by being uniformly processed in the cloud and sent back to the home institution without the need for costly infrastructure. The integrated package will enable clinicians in any practice environment to efficiently and reliably visualize function on the brain’s anatomy prior to surgery.",Clinical resting state fMRI software for surgical planning,9409171,R44GM125438,"['Algorithms ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomy ', ' Dorsum ', ' Back ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Mapping ', ' tumors in the brain ', ' Brain Tumors ', ' Brain Neoplasia ', ' Brain Neoplasms ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Environment ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Heart ', ' Industry ', ' Language ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Names ', ' Patients ', ' Biological Preservation ', ' preservation ', ' Biologic Preservation ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality Control ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' Radiology ', ' General Radiology ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Science ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Standardization ', ' statistics ', ' Supervision ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' training module ', ' Training Activity ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Work ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' Picture Archiving and Communication System ', ' improved ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' Lesion ', ' Failure ', ' Intuition ', ' Individual ', ' neuro-surgeon ', ' Neurosurgeon ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Scanning ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Malignant Glioma ', ' Malignant Neuroglial Tumor ', ' Malignant Neuroglial Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Glial Tumor ', ' Malignant Glial Neoplasm ', ' Surgeon ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' functional status ', ' Excision ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Image-Guided Surgery ', ' surgical imaging ', ' intra-operative imaging ', ' Institution ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Output ', ' brain tumor resection ', ' cost ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Outcome ', ' Imaging technology ', ' Population ', ' Mind ', ' Stress Tests ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' computing resources ', ' computational resources ', ' user-friendly ', ' Network-based ', ' translational approach ', ' translational strategy ', ' translation strategy ', ' tumor ', ' patient population ', ' industry partner ', ' industry partnership ', ' industrial partnership ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' Cloud Computing ', ' cloud computer ', ' Cloud Infrastructure ', ' Algorithmic Software ', ' Software Algorithm ', ' Algorithmic Tools ', ' cloud based ', ' imaging software ', ' personalized approach ', ' tailored approach ', ' precision approach ', ' individualized approach ', ' Personalized medical approach ', ' improved outcome ', ' clinical imaging ', ' imaging capabilities ', ' ']",NIGMS,"RADIOLOGICS, INC.",R44,2017,749900,MO-02,-0.028046863375015073
"Slicer+PLUS: Collaborative, open-source software for ultrasound analysis Abstract The target users of the proposed Slicer+PLUS framework are researchers and developers who are focusing on low-cost point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) applications. POCUS applications are characterized by utilizing low-cost, portable U/S systems; in the hands of novice operators; with novel data acquisition, signal processing, and machine learning methods; with imprecise trackers; and in highly unconstrained point-of-care environments, e.g.: at the scene of accidents for patient triage, in the offices of general practitioners for scoliosis detection and monitoring, in patients' homes for an aging population, as well as throughout hospitals. In these contexts, many are considering POCUS devices to be the stethoscopes of the future.  The foundation of Slicer+PLUS is the integration and extension of 3D Slicer, PLUS, and MUSiiC. We are the developers of these libraries. We, and the users of our libraries, are proposing Slicer+PLUS so that the Slicer, PLUS, and MUSiiC communities can come together and cohesively address the important challenges and opportunities posed by POCUS applications. Over 30 letters of support are included with this application.  3D Slicer is a world-class, freely available open-source platform for medical image segmentation, registration, and visualization. PLUS is a world-class, open-source library for communicating with ultrasound machines and trackers (for following objects in 3D using magnetic, optical, and other technologies). MUSiiC is a (previously closed source) library that focuses on advanced ultrasound acquisition and analysis methods, such as ultrasound reconstruction pipelines, elastography, and photoacoustic imaging. Together, these toolkits have averaged over 5,100 downloads per month for the past year.  A central tenant of our work is that POCUS applications should not be viewed as simply involving the use of inexpensive, portable U/S systems; POCUS must be viewed as a new modality for it to attain its full potential. POCUS must involve innovative, automated data analysis methods and workflows that can guide a user to properly place and manipulate an ultrasound probe and interpret the returned ultrasound data. In particular, the output of those workflows and analyses should be quantitative measures, not b-mode images, since the expertise to interpret such images will not be readily available at points-of-care. To that end, the proposed work goes well beyond simple integration of Slicer, PLUS, and MUSiiC. Multiple innovations are proposed such as Ultrasound Spectroscopy for tissue labeling, Dynamic Textures for anatomic localization of ultrasound probes, and self-tracking ultrasound probes.  To assess our progress towards our goals, our team includes our target users: researchers, medical device manufacturers, and clinical innovators dedicated to low-cost POCUS applications. They will be validating our efforts by integrating them into their research and translational POCUS product development projects. Project Narrative  Low-cost ultrasound probes have the potential to become the stethoscopes of the future and revolutionize in-field and in-hospital patient care. Our goal is to integrate, enhance, and disseminate three cutting edge ultrasound acquisition, analysis, and display toolkits to create a new framework called Slicer+PLUS that will serve as a catalyst for research and product development into low-cost point-of-care ultrasound applications. In particular, our framework will include and facilitate innovative methods for guiding a novice user in ultrasound probe placement and for automatically interpreting ultrasound data to provide a diagnosis, without the user having to interpret a traditional B-mode ultrasound image at any point in the process. The Slicer+PLUS framework will be validated using tasks associated with (a) emergency service personnel performing Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) exams at the scene of an accident to detect or rule-out intra-abdominal bleeding; (b) the clinical monitoring of scoliosis progression in children in general practitioners' offices; and (c) the translation of research into regulatory-approved products based on Slicer+PLUS.","Slicer+PLUS: Collaborative, open-source software for ultrasound analysis",9544350,R01EB021396,"['Abdominal ', ' Abdomen ', ' Accidents ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomy ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Communities ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Diagnosis ', ' emergency service ', ' Emergency medical service ', ' Environment ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Generalists ', ' General Practitioners ', ' Goals ', ' blood loss ', ' Bleeding ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Hospitals ', ' Libraries ', ' Medical Device ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Patients ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Support ', ' scoliosis ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Spectrum Analysis ', ' Spectrum Analyses ', ' Spectroscopy ', ' Vertebral column ', ' backbone ', ' Spine ', ' Spinal Column ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' ultrasound scanning ', ' ultrasound imaging ', ' ultrasound ', ' sound measurement ', ' sonography ', ' sonogram ', ' diagnostic ultrasound ', ' Ultrasound Test ', ' Ultrasound Medical Imaging ', ' Ultrasound Diagnosis ', ' Ultrasonogram ', ' Ultrasonic Imaging ', ' Medical Ultrasound ', ' Echotomography ', ' Echography ', ' Ultrasonography ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Visualization ', ' Imagery ', ' catalyst ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' Stethoscopes ', ' Clinical ', ' Letters ', ' Shapes ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Life ', ' Frequencies ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Source ', ' Texture ', ' System ', ' Magnetism ', ' magnetic ', ' innovative technologies ', ' hospital patient care ', ' cohesion ', ' novel ', ' Modality ', ' Devices ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' software development ', ' developing computer software ', ' develop software ', ' portability ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Documentation ', ' Manufacturer Name ', ' Manufacturer ', ' image guided therapy ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Intra-abdominal ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research ', ' Monitor ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' point of care ', ' first responder ', ' emergency service responder ', ' emergency service personnel ', ' Emergency responder ', ' emergency service/first responder ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Output ', ' cost ', ' reconstruction ', ' 3D analysis ', ' 3-dimensional analysis ', ' 3-D analysis ', ' Three-dimensional analysis ', ' Trauma ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' imaging Segmentation ', ' data acquisition ', ' open source ', ' aging population ', ' population aging ', ' aged population ', ' product development ', ' photoacoustic imaging ', ' optoacoustic imaging ', ' elastography ', ' signal processing ', ' Patient Triage ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' clinical translation ', ' ']",NIBIB,"KITWARE, INC.",R01,2017,81360,NY-20,0.04734912538163165
"Top-down control of auditory processing in the cortico-collicular network (Administrative Supplement) Project Summary Throughout life, humans and other animals learn statistical regularities in the acoustic environment and adapt their hearing to emphasize the elements of sound that are important for behavioral decisions. Using these abilities, normal-hearing humans are able to perceive important sounds in crowded noisy environments and understand the speech of individuals the first time they meet. However, patients with peripheral hearing loss or central processing disorders often have problems hearing in these challenging settings, even when sound is amplified above perceptual threshold. This study seeks to characterize how two major areas in the brain's auditory network, auditory cortex and midbrain inferior colliculus, establish an interface between incoming auditory signals and the internal brain states that select information appropriate to the current behavioral context. Single-unit neural activity will be recorded from both of these brain areas in awake ferrets during the presentation of complex naturalistic sounds that mimic the acoustic environment encountered in the real world. Internal brain state will be controlled by selective attention to specific sound features in these complex stimuli. Changes in stimulus-evoked neural activity as attention shifts among sound features will be measured to identify interactions between internal state and incoming sensory signals in these different areas. Previous work has identified a large corticofugal projection from auditory cortex to inferior colliculus that could produce task-dependent changes in selectivity in inferior colliculus. This study will test the role of these corticofugal projections by optogenetic inactivation of auditory cortex during recordings from inferior colliculus. Selective inactivation of specific pathways will characterize how the network of brain areas works together to produce effective auditory behaviors. Computational modeling tools will be used to determine, from an algorithmic perspective, how neurons encode information about the natural stimuli and how this encoding changes as attention is shifted between features. Data collected during behavior will be used to develop models that combine bottom-up sensory processing and top-down behavioral control. This computational approach builds on classic characterizations of neural stimulus-response relationships using spectro-temporal receptive field models. New models will be developed that incorporate behavioral state variables and nonlinear biological circuit elements into established model frameworks. Together, these studies will provide new insight into the computational strategies used by the behaving brain to process complex sounds in real-world contexts. Project Narrative Patients with hearing impairments and central neurological disorders have difficulty processing and making accurate judgments about auditory stimuli, particular in challenging noisy environments. We seek to understand how the healthy brain learns to extract useful information from sounds in order to guide effective behavior. These experiments will provide novel insight into how the brain solves problems that can be used to develop new devices and treatments for these debilitating conditions.",Top-down control of auditory processing in the cortico-collicular network (Administrative Supplement),9385957,R01DC014950,"['Acoustic ', ' Acoustics ', ' Algorithms ', ' Animals ', ' Attention ', ' Auditory Cortex ', ' Auditory area ', ' Behavior ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Crowding ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Feedback ', ' Ferrets ', ' sound perception ', ' hearing perception ', ' Hearing ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Inferior Colliculus ', ' Posterior Quadrigeminal Body ', ' Judgment ', ' Learning ', ' Mammals ', ' Mammalia ', ' Midbrain structure ', ' Midbrain ', ' Mid-brain ', ' Mesencephalon ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurons ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Research ', ' Rewards ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' sound ', ' Speech ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' auditory stimulus ', ' base ', ' hearing prosthetic ', ' hearing prosthesis ', ' ear prosthetic ', ' ear prosthesis ', ' auricular prosthetic ', ' Auricular prosthesis ', ' Peripheral ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' Nonlinear Models ', ' Non-linear Models ', ' Link ', ' selective attention ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' awake ', ' receptive field ', ' Individual ', ' hearing disease ', ' Hearing Disorders ', ' Hearing problem ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Behavior Control ', ' behavioral control ', ' Behavioral Manipulation ', ' Life ', ' Auditory ', ' Complex ', ' Stream ', ' Sensory ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Response to stimulus physiology ', ' stimulus/response ', ' Auditory system ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Structure ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Central Auditory Processing Disorder ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' behavior influence ', ' behavioral influence ', ' hearing impairment ', ' Hypoacusis ', ' Hypoacuses ', ' Hearing Loss ', ' Administrative Supplement ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Synaptic plasticity ', ' Impairment ', ' optogenetics ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' auditory processing ', ' ']",NIDCD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,131801,OR-03,-0.01812324337920666
"THE XNAT IMAGING INFORMATICS PLATFORM PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal aims to continue the development of XNAT. XNAT is an imaging informatics platform designed to facilitate common management and productivity tasks for imaging and associated data. We will develop the next generation of XNAT technology to support the ongoing evolution of imaging research. Development will focus on modernizing and expanding the current system. In Aim 1, we will implement new web application infrastructure that includes a new archive file management system, a new event bus to manage cross-service orchestration and a new Javascript library to simplify user interface development. We will also implement new core services, including a Docker Container service, a dynamic scripting engine, and a global XNAT federation. In Aim 2, we will implement two innovative new capabilities that build on the services developed in Aim 1. The XNAT Publisher framework will streamline the process of data sharing by automating the creation and curation of data releases following best practices for data publication and stewardship. The XNAT Machine Learning framework will streamline the development and use of machine learning applications by integrating XNAT with the TensorFlow machine learning environment and implementing provenance and other monitoring features to help avoid the pitfalls that often plague machine learning efforts. For both Aim 1 and 2, all capabilities will be developed and evaluated in the context of real world scientific programs that are actively using the XNAT platform. In Aim 3, we will provide extensive support to the XNAT community, including training workshops, online documentation, discussion forums, and . These activities will be targeted at both XNAT users and developers. RELEVANCE Medical imaging is one of the key methods used by biomedical researchers to study human biology in health and disease.

"Individualized Signal Processing Strategy :Phase II This project describes a novel approach to automate and individualize the signal processing strategy for hearing aids (HA) that can result in improved speech intelligibility in background noise, greater user satisfaction and acceptance for HAs, and reduce barriers to affordable hearing health care. The proposed Individualized Signal Processing Strategy (ISPS) is based on individual performance on categorical perception tasks for speech stimuli. This differs from traditional methods based on sophisticated gain models built upon average perception, performance, and preference data. The ability to determine one’s ISPS automatically, rapidly and remotely can result in dramatic cost-savings and greater accessibility to hearing health care for patients who cannot afford it or for those who lack easy access to the necessary expertise. These technical achievements have the potential to radically change HA service delivery models yet can be implemented within existing business models and in concert with current practitioners. The ISPS method effectively replaces target-based HA fitting (e.g. NAL-NL2) with individualized speech-based parameter adjustment. The proposed work follows successful completion of our pilot project and builds upon the research team’s prior research on novel fitting methods for cochlear implant (CI) devices recently acquired by Cochlear, Ltd. Following the successful implementation of ISPS and integration with commercial HA software in the pilot study, we demonstrated feasibility including a field study in which performance outcomes for the ISPS method were as good as a conventional HA fitting method and only took a fraction of the time, despite ISPS having no prior knowledge of patient characteristics and no audiogram. Successful maturation and commercialization of the ISPS technology in Phase II will address several barriers identified in the previous RFA-DC-12-004 including physical, infrastructure, and knowledge barriers (by allowing remote or self-fitting HAs), economic barriers (by reducing overall costs), and cultural barriers (by providing easy access to HA fitting for patients who tend to avoid professional help). This Phase II project will develop an operational ISPS method by (1) integrating ISPS with hardware/software systems of our industry partners, (2) refine and enhance the ISPS method to improve efficiency and effectiveness of fitting hearing instruments, (3) build support for the use of ISPS in multiple marketplaces, and (4) evaluate the technology through field trials in different service delivery environments by comparing outcomes with ISPS fitting to those achieved with traditional prescriptive gain fitting within the same subjects. Following successful demonstration of these objectives, a Phase III project will focus on the transition of the technology to support remote and self-fitting of hearing instruments. This project seeks to develop, implement and test a novel automated method for fitting hearing aids based on real-time speech perception performance. This automated approach can improve hearing aid success while significant reducing costs of hearing health care.

"Crowd-Sourced Annotation of Longitudinal Sensor Data to Enhance Data-Driven Precision Medicine for Behavioral Health ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Longitudinal sensor data collected passively from mobile phones and other wearable sensors will transform behavioral science by allowing researchers to use ""big data,"" but at the person-level, to understand how behavior and related environmental exposures impact health outcomes. Computers will analyze individual-level data streams to permit unprecedented, individual-level precision in research and intervention. This type of precision medicine enables targeting of science and medicine to a particular individual's genetic makeup, past and current situation, and behavioral health exposures. Mobile phones, smartwatches, and common fitness devices are already capable of generating rich data on behavior, but developing algorithms to interpret that raw data using the latest machine learning algorithms requires practical strategies to annotate large datasets. We propose to develop and test the feasibility and usability of a mobile and online crowdsource-based system for cleaning and annotating behavioral data collected from motion sensors, mobile phones, and other mobile devices. Our goal is to demonstrate how individuals playing mobile and online games - the ""crowd"" - can collectively, affordably, and incrementally clean and add important metadata to raw sensor data that has been passively collected from individuals, similar to that from population-scale surveillance studies (e.g., the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and UK Biobank) and those planned for studies such as the White House's Precision Medicine Initiative. The game-playing crowd will thereby dramatically improve the utility of the datasets collected for a variety of scientific studies. We will validate our prototye system on datasets collected from motion monitors used to study physical activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep, but we will demonstrate how the system could be extended for use on the increasingly rich datasets that are being collected with mobile devices and that include not only motion data, but also sensor data on location, light, audio, and person-to-person proximity. We will then refine the system, foster a community of crowd game players interested in citizen science, and release the source code to the system as an open source project so that other researchers can adapt the technique for their own work. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Longitudinal sensor data collected passively from wearable activity monitors and mobile phones will transform behavioral science by allowing researchers to use ""big data,"" but at the person-level, to understand how behavior and related environmental exposures impact health outcomes and personalize health intervention and research. We propose to develop and test a system that permits typical mobile application game players to help scientists improve this type of data, by adding additional annotations that enrich the data, making it more useful for behavioral science and more amenable to automatic processing. This will help researchers to better understand how individual-level behaviors relate to health outcomes in current research studies that collect personal-level sensor data such as NHANES and the Women's Health Study, and future big data ventures such as the new Precision Medicine Initiative.",Crowd-Sourced Annotation of Longitudinal Sensor Data to Enhance Data-Driven Precision Medicine for Behavioral Health,9357585,UH2EB024407,"['Algorithms ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Crowding ', ' Data Collection ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Manuals ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Motion ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Phonation ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Science ', ' Sleep ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Female Health ', "" Women's Health "", ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Data Quality ', ' Funding ', ' tool ', ' instrument ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' NHANES ', ' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Stream ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' interest ', ' American ', ' Performance ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' research study ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Devices ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' behavioral health ', ' Proteomics ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Genomics ', ' Car Phone ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' metabolomics ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' fitness ', ' Data ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' meta data ', ' Metadata ', ' Output ', ' Source Code ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' visualization tool ', ' Visualization software ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' open source ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' mobile device ', ' usability ', ' prototype ', ' public health relevance ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' surveillance study ', ' mobile application ', ' mobile app ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' precision medicine ', ' Precision Medicine Initiative ', ' sedentary lifestyle ', ' Sedentary life-style ', ' Sedentary behavior ', ' genetic makeup ', ' genetic make-up ', ' temporal measurement ', ' time measurement ', ' temporal resolution ', ' citizen science ', ' scientific citizenship ', ' crowd-sourced science ', ' crowd science ', ' civic science ', ' citizen scientists ', ' amateur scientists ', ' amateur science ', ' crowdsourcing ', ' crowdsource ', ' crowd-sourcing ', ' crowd source ', ' mobile computing ', ' mobile technology ', ' mobile platform ', ' Data Science ', ' Data Scientist ', ' Accelerometer ', ' activity tracker ', ' activity monitor ', ' accelerometry ', ' ubiquitous computing ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' annotation  system ', ' annotation tool ', ' annotation framework ', ' ']",NIBIB,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,UH2,2017,300665,MA-07,0.0004255259228999269
"User-driven fitting of hearing aids and other assistive hearing devices Hearing aids are the principal tool today for ameliorating age-related hearing loss and its significant social, cognitive and functional costs to patients and society at large. However, many individuals who are prescribed hearing aids do not use them at all, or use them only occasionally. Most reasons behind the “hearing aid in the drawer” phenomenon relate to the characteristics of the sound produced, and could, in theory, be addressed with the correct signal processing strategy. The problem persists despite the increased complexity and power of new devices, for three reasons: (a) The hearing aid parameters, as set in the clinic, introduce distortion or render audible many sounds that the hearing impaired user had become accustomed to not hearing. The novelty is often so uncomfortable for the user as to discard the device. (b) The optimum parameters vary depending on the listening task and environment. Under some conditions, a device with parameters designed for a different condition will perform worse than no device at all. (c) The clinical fitting is derived from a non-ideal way to assess auditory function (the pure- tone audiogram). The optimum parameters for the actual impairment may be different from those of the prescribed fitting. Although it is true that the physiological mechanisms make it impossible to process sound so as to completely reverse the effect of sensorineural hearing loss, a device that delivers some benefit at all times is likely to be used all the time. The goal is to develop a hearing aid that can adaptively change its parameters to address the problems above, and will be accomplished with a novel fitting approach that rapidly presents a number of parameter settings to the user and lets the user guide the system toward the optimal settings for each listening situation. This requires the development of machine-learning algorithms to effectively search the parameter space and user interface devices and instructions that are easy for the patient to use. The focus of this Phase I proposal is the development of the algorithms and the adaptive user-driven fitting program, and to compare the proposed fitting with the traditional audiogram-based fitting across measures of functional hearing (ability to recognize speech in noise) and subjective preference. A hearing aid user is often dissatisfied with the sound quality of their device, despite its sophistication and adjustment by a trained audiologist. The problem can be mitigated by letting the user fine-tune the device for maximum comfort in everyday use. We will apply modern machine learning methods to develop a program for efficient user-driven fitting of hearing assistive devices.",User-driven fitting of hearing aids and other assistive hearing devices,9409910,R43DC016251,"['Algorithms ', ' Audiometric Test ', ' Audiogram ', ' Audiometry ', ' Dorsum ', ' Back ', ' Books ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' sound perception ', ' hearing perception ', ' Hearing ', ' Hearing Aids ', ' Sensory Hearing Loss ', ' Sensorineural Deafness ', ' Sensorineural Hearing Loss ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Likelihood Functions ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Modernization ', ' Music ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Presbycusis ', ' age related hearing loss ', ' Presbyacusis ', ' Psychology ', ' Psychophysics ', ' psychophysical ', ' Relaxation ', ' Self-Help Devices ', ' assistive device ', ' Assistive Technology ', ' Societies ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' sound ', ' Speech ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Training ', ' Intuition ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Auditory ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' System ', ' preference ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' Speed ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' models and simulation ', ' model-based simulation ', ' Devices ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' performance tests ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' hearing impairment ', ' Hypoacusis ', ' Hypoacuses ', ' Hearing Loss ', ' Address ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Cognitive ', ' Update ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Instruction ', ' vector ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Impairment ', ' signal processing ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' ']",NIDCD,"CARAWAY SOFTWARE, INC.",R43,2017,224966,CA-18,-0.009723774350551566
"NRI: An Egocentric Computer Vision based Active Learning Co-Robot Wheelchair DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The aim of this proposal is to conduct research on the foundational models and algorithms in computer vision and machine learning for an egocentric vision based active learning co-robot wheelchair system to improve the quality of life of elders and disabled who have limited hand functionality or no hand functionality at all, and rely on wheelchairs for mobility. In this co-robt system, the wheelchair users wear a pair of egocentric camera glasses, i.e., the camera is capturing the users' field-of-the-views. This project help reduce the patients' reliance on care-givers. It fits NINR's mission in addressing key issues raised by the Nation's aging population and shortages of healthcare workforces, and in supporting patient-focused research that encourage and enable individuals to become guardians of their own well-beings.  The egocentric camera serves two purposes. On one hand, from vision based motion sensing, the system can capture unique head motion patterns of the users to control the robot wheelchair in a noninvasive way. Secondly, it serves as a unique environment aware vision sensor for the co-robot system as the user will naturally respond to the surroundings by turning their focus of attention, either consciously or subconsciously. Based on the inputs from the egocentric vision sensor and other on-board robotic sensors, an online learning reservoir computing network is exploited, which not only enables the robotic wheelchair system to actively solicit controls from the users when uncertainty is too high for autonomous operation, but also facilitates the robotic wheelchair system to learn from the solicited user controls. This way, the closed- loop co-robot wheelchair system will evolve and be more capable of handling more complicated environment overtime.  The aims ofthe project include: 1) develop an method to harness egocentric computer vision-based sensing of head movements as an alternative method for wheelchair control; 2) develop a method leveraging visual motion from the egocentric camera for category independent moving obstacle detection; and 3) close the loop of the active learning co-robot wheelchair system through uncertainty based active online learning. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:          The project will improve the quality of life of those elders and disabled who rely on wheelchairs for mobility, and reduce their reliance on care-givers. It builds an intelligent wheelchair robot system that can adapt itself to the personalized behavior of the user.

"An evaluation of sensor technology to monitor and report compliance with an evidence-based intervention to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The candidate, Nishi Rawat, is a Critical Care physician and Assistant Professor in the Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care Medicine at Johns Hopkins. Her goal is to become an independent investigator focused on advancing the field of quality improvement to improve the quality of health care delivered to Americans, while simultaneously reducing costs, with an emphasis on the application of information technology to evaluate performance, minimize waste and eliminate redundancies.  The candidate's preliminary work as a co-investigator for two collaboratives to reduce ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) suggests that there is a strong drive to eliminate preventable harms such as VAP, but weak available methodologies and resources to do so. There is a dire need for an effective and inexpensive methodology to track the delivery of evidence-based interventions for the purpose of quality improvement. The proposed research intends to fill this measurement gap. In this proposal, she evaluates the utility of the sensor approach for measuring and improving quality of care, focusing on VAP prevention intervention performance.  The aims propose: evaluate the utility of the sensor approach for measuring compliance with a VAP prevention intervention by comparing VAP process measure performance estimates captured by sensor technology to estimates obtained by traditional manual data collection (Aim 1); design and pilot a strategy to provide real-time feedback of sensor process measure compliance to providers (Aim 2); evaluate the impact of the sensor approach on VAP process measure compliance by comparing compliance before and after the implementation of the real-time feedback strategy (Aim 3). The proposed work could fundamentally change how healthcare monitors and reports important care interventions, and has the potential to make quality improvement more efficient, inexpensive and scalable.  The candidate is uniquely qualified to undertake the proposed work. She is double-board certified in Critical Care and Emergency Medicine, and has completed a Patient Safety and Quality fellowship. She has led multiple local quality improvement initiatives, and worked to decrease ICU costs as part of a national task force, and is currently co-investigator of large national infection prevention collaborative. It isher determination, enthusiasm and strong work ethic which have enabled her to balance these research activities with a heavy clinical commitment. She now needs protected time for research and career development to become an independent investigator.

"Cloud Based Resource for Data Hosting, Visualization and Analysis Using UCSC Canc DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cancer genomics resources are growing at an unprecedented pace. However, a comprehensive analysis of the cancer genome still remains a daunting challenge. This is in part due to the difficulties in visualizing, integrating, and analyzng cancer genomics data with current technologies. We propose to develop a cloud-based platform to empower researchers with the ability to host, visualize and analyze their own data. The platform is composed of a set of Cancer Analytics Virtual Machines (CAVMs). The main component of each CAVM is a data server which functions to store and serve user data to applications, such as the UCSC Cancer Genomics Browser, to provide data visualization. The second component is a modified Galaxy workflow system to provide data analysis capability. UCSC's suite of analysis tools for nextgen sequencing data analysis and pathway inference will be prepackaged with the system. The two components will be highly integrated to allow tightly coupled cycles of data visualization and analysis. The data server component will be modular such that it can provide data independently to applications besides the Cancer Browser and Galaxy. We will deliver virtual machine images that can be easily initiated in a commercial cloud such as Amazon, or can be installed within a user's own institution. The CAVM also functions as a way for users to Integrate with external large-scale databases. We will deliver a UCSC CAVM that other CAVM instances can connect to, to provide authorized data access from the UCSC cancer genomics data repository. The system allows the dynamic formation of new datasets composed of data slices from multiple sources. This ability to combine data into larger samples will provide the statistical power to allow discoveries that would otherwise not be possible. We aim to eliminate, or significantly reduce, the overhead of system configuration and software installation. Our tools will provide users the capability to access a cloud-based cluster computing environment, which will make sophisticated, computationally intensive analyses accessible to researchers who might not, have access to compute servers. The software platform we develop can be used by individual bench biologists, and also by large projects to serve data to individual users or to other projects. This design has the potential to form an expansive federated database accessible through the same software interface.         RELEVANCE: Currently, clinicians and bench biologists typically depend on external collaborators for data analysis. The proposed system will provide these scientists with data analysis and visualization methods that are both powerful and easy to use.

"Real-time prediction of marijuana use & effects of use on cognition in the natural environment ABSTRACT Some young adult marijuana (MJ) users report adverse effects of MJ use on cognition that impact daily functioning, with negative consequences such as injury and fatality due to driving while under the influence of MJ. Research on the effects of MJ use on cognition, however, has produced mixed findings. MJ effects on cognition may depend on factors such as history and current severity of marijuana use, time since last MJ use (including possible MJ withdrawal effects), and gender. This R21 aims to address limitations of existing research by (1) starting to develop an algorithm to predict MJ use using smartphone data in regular/heavy MJ users based on “routine” or “habitual use”, and (2) examining effects of MJ use on cognition using smartphone- based cognitive testing in the natural environment. Development of an algorithm to predict MJ use would facilitate systematic assessment of MJ effects on cognitive functioning through more efficient scheduling of smartphone cognitive testing among regular/heavy MJ users in relation to daily routines. Cognitive testing by smartphone in the natural environment is an innovative method that has shown validity, and permits sampling of cognitive functioning within and across days in relation to MJ use. This project will enroll non-treatment seeking young adult (ages 18-25) MJ users from the community, representing “low”, “regular”, and “heavy” MJ use, with 50% female at each level of use. Participants will complete a baseline lab assessment, 30-day data collection using smartphone and wearable devices (e.g., wristband), and a debriefing interview. Piloting will optimize the protocol and methods for compliance. Smartphones will collect continuously sensed data (e.g., geolocation) for input to an algorithm to predict MJ use in regular/heavy MJ users. This R21 will identify which types of data, available through smartphone, provide optimal detection of routines in MJ use among regular/heavy users. Smartphone cognitive testing will be administered at various times during acute MJ intoxication and various naturalistically occurring lengths of MJ abstinence to examine effects of MJ use on selected aspects of cognitive functioning in daily life. Development of an algorithm to predict MJ use in regular/heavy MJ users based on smartphone data could, for example, facilitate real-time assessment of MJ effects on cognition through improved sampling of cognition in relation to acute and non-acute effects of MJ use. This R21 will provide the foundation for a research program that aims to examine MJ effects on cognitive functioning in vivo, and could support the development of just-in-time intervention to reduce MJ use. This R21 aligns with NIDA's strategic goal of determining consequences of drug use, and cross-cutting themes of highlighting real-world relevance of research and leveraging mobile health technologies to reduce drug use. Project Narrative This exploratory project will initiate development of an algorithm to predict marijuana use using data from smartphone and ecological momentary assessment, and will examine effects of marijuana use on cognitive functioning in the natural environment using innovative smartphone-based cognitive tests. Developing an algorithm to predict marijuana use has substantial healthcare applications, specifically for timely intervention to reduce marijuana use.

"New Computational Methods for Data-driven Protein Structure Prediction Proteins and their interactions play fundamental roles in all biological processes. Accurate description of protein structure and interactions is a fundamental step towards understanding biological life and highly relevant in the development of therapeutics and drugs. However, there is a large gap between the number of available protein sequences and the number of proteins (complexes) with solved structures and accurate interaction description, which has to be filled by computational prediction. The long-term goal of this project is to apply statistical machine learning and optimization algorithms to understand protein sequence-structure-function relationship by analyzing low- and high-throughput sequence, structure and functional data and to develop algorithms for structure and functional prediction. Our hypothesis is that by developing sophisticated algorithms to take advantage of the growing sequence and structure data, we can model sequence-structure relationship much more accurately and significantly improve structure and functional prediction, in particular for this proposal, residue (atomic) interaction strength prediction and remote homology detection. This project has produced a few CASP-winning, widely-used data-driven algorithms and web server (http://raptorx.uchicago.edu) for monomer protein modeling. This renewal will not only further develop machine learning algorithms (especially Deep Learning and probabilistic graphical models) for monomer proteins, but also branch out to protein interactions (complexes). The specific aims are: (1) develop novel structure learning algorithms to predict inter-reside contacts and coevolved residues; (2) develop context-specific, coevolution-based, and distance-dependent statistical potentials using a new machine learning model called Deep Conditional (Markov) Neural Fields (DeepCNF); (3) develop Markov Random Fields (MRF) and DeepCNF methods for remote protein (interface/complex) homology detection and fold recognition to make use of long-range residue interaction predicted by the first two aims. This renewal will lead to further understanding and new models of protein sequence-structure-function relationship and yield publicly available software and servers for automated, accurate, quantitative analysis for a wide range of proteins and their interactions. The impact will be multiplied by tens of thousands of worldwide users employing the resulting software/servers to study a wide variety of proteins and interactions relevant to basic biological research and human diseases, in both low- and high-throughput experiments.

"Top-down control of auditory processing in the cortico-collicular network Project Summary Throughout life, humans and other animals learn statistical regularities in the acoustic environment and adapt their hearing to emphasize the elements of sound that are important for behavioral decisions. Using these abilities, normal-hearing humans are able to perceive important sounds in crowded noisy environments and understand the speech of individuals the first time they meet. However, patients with peripheral hearing loss or central processing disorders often have problems hearing in these challenging settings, even when sound is amplified above perceptual threshold. This study seeks to characterize how two major areas in the brain's auditory network, auditory cortex and midbrain inferior colliculus, establish an interface between incoming auditory signals and the internal brain states that select information appropriate to the current behavioral context. Single-unit neural activity will be recorded from both of these brain areas in awake ferrets during the presentation of complex naturalistic sounds that mimic the acoustic environment encountered in the real world. Internal brain state will be controlled by selective attention to specific sound features in these complex stimuli. Changes in stimulus-evoked neural activity as attention shifts among sound features will be measured to identify interactions between internal state and incoming sensory signals in these different areas. Previous work has identified a large corticofugal projection from auditory cortex to inferior colliculus that could produce task-dependent changes in selectivity in inferior colliculus. This study will test the role of these corticofugal projections by optogenetic inactivation of auditory cortex during recordings from inferior colliculus. Selective inactivation of specific pathways will characterize how the network of brain areas works together to produce effective auditory behaviors. Computational modeling tools will be used to determine, from an algorithmic perspective, how neurons encode information about the natural stimuli and how this encoding changes as attention is shifted between features. Data collected during behavior will be used to develop models that combine bottom-up sensory processing and top-down behavioral control. This computational approach builds on classic characterizations of neural stimulus-response relationships using spectro-temporal receptive field models. New models will be developed that incorporate behavioral state variables and nonlinear biological circuit elements into established model frameworks. Together, these studies will provide new insight into the computational strategies used by the behaving brain to process complex sounds in real-world contexts. Project Narrative Patients with hearing impairments and central neurological disorders have difficulty processing and making accurate judgments about auditory stimuli, particular in challenging noisy environments. We seek to understand how the healthy brain learns to extract useful information from sounds in order to guide effective behavior. These experiments will provide novel insight into how the brain solves problems that can be used to develop new devices and treatments for these debilitating conditions.",Top-down control of auditory processing in the cortico-collicular network,9207441,R01DC014950,"['Acoustic ', ' Acoustics ', ' Algorithms ', ' Animals ', ' Attention ', ' Auditory Cortex ', ' Auditory area ', ' Behavior ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Crowding ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Feedback ', ' Ferrets ', ' sound perception ', ' hearing perception ', ' Hearing ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Inferior Colliculus ', ' Posterior Quadrigeminal Body ', ' Judgment ', ' Learning ', ' Mammals ', ' Mammalia ', ' Midbrain structure ', ' Midbrain ', ' Mid-brain ', ' Mesencephalon ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurons ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Research ', ' Rewards ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' sound ', ' Speech ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' auditory stimulus ', ' base ', ' hearing prosthetic ', ' hearing prosthesis ', ' ear prosthetic ', ' ear prosthesis ', ' auricular prosthetic ', ' Auricular prosthesis ', ' Peripheral ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' Nonlinear Models ', ' Non-linear Models ', ' Link ', ' selective attention ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' awake ', ' receptive field ', ' Individual ', ' hearing disease ', ' Hearing Disorders ', ' Hearing problem ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Behavior Control ', ' behavioral control ', ' Behavioral Manipulation ', ' Life ', ' Auditory ', ' Complex ', ' Stream ', ' Sensory ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Response to stimulus physiology ', ' stimulus/response ', ' Auditory system ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Structure ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Central Auditory Processing Disorder ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' behavior influence ', ' behavioral influence ', ' hearing impairment ', ' Hypoacusis ', ' Hypoacuses ', ' Hearing Loss ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Synaptic plasticity ', ' Impairment ', ' optogenetics ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' auditory processing ', ' ']",NIDCD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,327250,OR-03,-0.01812324337920666

"Characterization of the manifestation of stages and processes of smoking behavior change in health-related social intercourse Title: Characterization of the manifestation of stages and processes of smoking behavior change in health-related social intercourse Abstract  Chronic disease management is largely dependent upon individuals’ engagement in adoption and modification of one or more health behaviors (e.g. medication adherence, daily exercise, smoking cessation) over long term. Despite prevalence of theory-guided behavior change interventions, behavior modification is oftentimes a chronic, relapsing effort in and of itself. The effect of social relationships and behavior change has been well documented, nonetheless, rarely infused into health interventions. Our understanding of (a) the mechanisms through which such influence affects human behaviors, and (b) how such influence can be harnessed to improve the effectiveness of theory-guided behavioral interventions is limited. In the proposed research, we will develop a set of semi-automated methods to characterize the interrelation between theory driven stages of behavior change and social influence models of human behavior in group settings, as embedded in user generated interactions on a health-related online community. While generally applicable, the methods will be developed based on communications among individuals attempting to quit smoking in an online community, QuitNet, the first online social network for smoking cessation. Advanced text analytics will be used to identify and extract the stages and processes of behavior change. Stage-oriented network affiliation models will then be used to characterize the interdependencies among social actors, behavioral processes, and behavioral states. This research proposal will result in 1) novel methods to incorporate behavioral stages and processes into network models of social influence; 2) scalable techniques to automate identification of behavioral stage through text annotation of user interactions; and 3) new proposals for the development of digital interventions and technology features that harness social ties and theoretical roots to support individuals engaging in health behavior change and chronic disease management.     This project investigates the manifestation of behavior change processes and stages in online social discourse focusing smoking cessation. As a component of the proposed research we will integrate automated text analysis and network models to understand social mechanisms and influence patterns underlying electronically captured peer-to-peer communication related to behavior modification. By enabling the study of content-specific communication events focusing on specific stages of change, the proposed research will provide actionable insights into the development of socio-behavioral interventions that target online communities and consider users’ behavioral state and stage. In addition, the research will provide understanding of the specific behavior change processes that trigger certain stage transitions.",Characterization of the manifestation of stages and processes of smoking behavior change in health-related social intercourse,9394563,R21CA220670,"['Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Archives ', ' Behavior ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Communication ', ' Decision Trees ', ' Exercise ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Manuals ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Semantics ', ' Social Behavior ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' sociobehavior ', ' Supervision ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' smoking cessation ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Self Management ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' behavioral problem ', ' Problem behavior ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Disease Management ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' behavior change ', ' Biological Neural Networks ', ' neural network ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' peer ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' social ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' behavior influence ', ' behavioral influence ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Smoking Behavior ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' Text ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' medication adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' digital ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Health behavior change ', ' Abstinence ', ' network models ', ' social networking website ', ' web-based social networking ', ' social networking web site ', ' social networking site ', ' online social networking ', ' online community ', ' virtual community ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R21,2017,213019,TX-09,-0.007804785362722429
"Towards a comprehensive multiscale 3D human interactome network PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Almost all proteins function through interacting with other proteins. On average, a protein interacts with ~5 other protein partners in the current human interactome. Therefore, it is of great importance to accurately determine the interface of each interaction, in order to understand how each protein works with different partners to carry out different functions. In our previous Nature Biotechnology study, we implemented a proteome-scale homology modeling approach to generate the first 3D human structural interactome: the interface for each interaction in this network was determined at atomic resolution through co-crystal structures and homology models. Using our 3D interactome, we found that, among >1,800 known disease genes associated with two or more clinically distinctly disorders, pairs of mutations on the same gene but in different interfaces with different partners are significantly more likely to cause distinct diseases. However, only 4,150 human protein interactions have co-crystal structures and 2,921 have high-quality homology models. ~50,000 interactions (87% of the current human interactome) are not amenable to current structural modeling methods. Here, we propose to develop a big-data-driven machine-learning approach integrating biophysiochemical, evolutionary, structural, and population genetic features to identify interaction- specific interfaces for the whole human interactome. Because several key features are unavailable for many proteins and interactions, we propose an innovative approach to use an ensemble of random forest classifiers, named Ensemble Protein Interface Classifier (EPIC), to address this large-scale non-random missing data problem (Aim 1). The high throughput of our massively parallel Clone-seq and INtegrated PrOtein INteractome perTurbation screening (InPOINT) pipeline! uniquely enables us to perform real-time experimental parameter optimization (in Years 2-4 we will clone ~1,500 mutations and examine their impact on ~2,500 interactions every year to iteratively evaluate and refine EPIC; Aim 2). Finally, we will construct a comprehensive multiscale 3D interactome for all known human protein-protein interactions: we will collect/generate atomic- resolution structural models for interactions whenever possible (co-crystal structures and homology models); we will accurately determine interaction-specific interface residues and domains for the whole human interactome. We will deploy an interactive web portal to disseminate our results and allow functional genomic inference in the context of our structural interactome (Aim 3). Our comprehensive multiscale 3D human interactome and the accompanying web portal will greatly reduce the barrier-to-entry for performing systematic structural analysis on a large number of proteins and their interactions, and open the flood gates for such analyses in genomic studies. NARRATIVE Almost all proteins function through interacting with other proteins and the structural details of these interaction interfaces are key in understanding protein function. However, the interfaces for vast majority of human protein interactions are currently unknown. Here, we propose to establish an innovative ensemble classifier approach and implement an unprecedented large-scale computational-experimental iterative learning scheme to predict interfaces for the whole human interactome, in anticipation that our predicted interfaces will help dissect functional sites of disease mutations and be useful for rational drug design to target these sites.",Towards a comprehensive multiscale 3D human interactome network,9375803,R01GM124559,"['Biotech ', ' Biotechnology ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Crystallization ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Drug Design ', ' Evolution ', ' Flooding ', ' Floods ', ' Genes ', ' Population Genetics ', ' Goals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Study models ', ' Structural Models ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Names ', ' Proteins ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' forest ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Individual ', ' Letters ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Missense Mutation ', ' Structure ', ' Graph ', ' Proteome ', ' Modeling ', ' protein protein interaction ', ' functional genomics ', ' Genomics ', ' Binding ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Homology Modeling ', ' Resolution ', ' Scheme ', ' Molecular ', ' Docking ', ' protein function ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' biological research ', ' user-friendly ', ' web-accessible ', ' screening ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' web portal ', ' internet portal ', ' ']",NIGMS,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,379776,NY-23,-0.04177698725547273
"Novel Use of Emergent Technologies to Improve Efficiency of Animal Model Research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Phase II project aims to continue development of a commercial quality, innovative cloud hosted information management system, called Climb 2.0(tm) that will increase laboratory efficiency and provide improved capabilities for research laboratories. Climb is designed to offer integrated laboratory process management modules that include mobile communications tools data monitoring and alert systems, and integrated access to Microsoft Azure Cloud(tm) Machine Learning and Stream Analytics services. Initially, Climb 2.0 will target animal model research laboratories; however, the core of the platform is designed to be adaptable to nearly any research type or related industry. Current research information management systems are primarily designed as record-keeping tools with little or no direct focus on laboratory efficiency or in enhancing value of the research data. They also do not leverage emergent mobile device technologies, social media frameworks, and data analysis and storage capabilities of cloud computing. Many laboratories still use paper as their primary recording system. Paper data logging is then followed by secondary data entry into a laboratory database. These systems are error prone, time consuming and lead to laboratory databases with significant time lags between data acquisition and data entry. Moreover, they do not recognized cumulative data relationships, which may identify important trends, and researchers often miss windows of opportunity to take action on time-sensitive events. In Phase I, RockStep Solutions demonstrated feasibility of an innovative Cloud Information Management Bundle system, Climb, which will increase efficiency and improve capabilities in animal model data management. During Phase I, a beta version of Climb was successfully developed and tested against strict performance metrics as a proof of concept. We successfully built a prototype with working interfaces that integrates real-time communication technologies with media capabilities of mobile devices. Phase II proposes four specific Aims: 1) Develop the technology infrastructure to support the secure and scalable Software as a Service (SaaS) deployment of Climb for enterprise commercial release; 2) Develop and extend the Phase-I prototype Data Monitoring and Messaging System (DMMS) into a platform ready for production use; 3) Extend Climb's DMMS adding a Stream Analytics engine to support Internet of Things (IoT) devices and streaming media; 4) Deploy a beta release of Climb at partner research labs, test and refine the product for final commercialization. To ensure Climb is developed with functionality and tools relevant to research organizations, RockStep Solutions has established collaborations with key beta sites to test all of the major functionality developed in this proposal. IMPACT: By leveraging emergent technologies and cloud computing, Climb offers several advantages: 1) enables real-time communications using familiar tools among members of research groups; 2) reduces the risk of experimental setbacks, and 3) enables complex experiments to be conducted efficiently. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The NIH Invests approximately $12 billion each year in animal model research that is central to both understanding basic biological processes and for developing applications directly related to improving human health. More cost-effective husbandry and colony management techniques, equipment, and new approaches to improve laboratory animal welfare and assure efficient and appropriate research use (e.g., through cost savings and reduced animal burden) are high priorities for NIH. RockStep Solutions proposes to meet this need by integrating existing and emergent software and communication technologies to create a novel solution, Climb 2.0, for research animal data management. Climb 2.0 extracts immediate value of data in animal research laboratories and extends the database into a multimedia communication network, thus enabling science that would be impractical to conduct with traditional methods.",Novel Use of Emergent Technologies to Improve Efficiency of Animal Model Research,9354497,R44GM112206,"['Algorithms ', ' Animal Research ', ' Animal Experimental Use ', ' Animal Experimentation ', ' Animal Welfare ', ' Animals ', ' Laboratory Animals ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Laboratory Information Systems ', ' Clinical Laboratory Information Systems ', ' Communication ', ' Forms of Communication ', ' Communications Media ', ' Computers ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Information Management ', ' Equipment ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Industry ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' Inventory ', ' Investments ', ' Laboratories ', ' Laboratory Research ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Management Information Systems ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Motion ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Paper ', ' Production ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Cost Savings ', ' information security ', ' Data awareness ', ' Data Security ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Phase ', ' Ensure ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' data storage ', ' data retrieval ', ' Data Storage and Retrieval ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Multimedia ', ' Multimedium ', ' programs ', ' Notification ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Stream ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Services ', ' data management ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' laptop ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' Transact ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Devices ', ' time interval ', ' computerized data processing ', ' data processing ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' The Jackson Laboratory ', ' Communication Tools ', ' Emergent Technologies ', ' Emerging Technologies ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cost ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' Consumption ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' analytical tool ', ' data acquisition ', ' graphical user interface ', ' graphic user interface ', ' Graphical interface ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' mobile device ', ' encryption ', ' usability ', ' prototype ', ' commercialization ', ' public health relevance ', ' good laboratory practice ', ' Secure ', ' Cloud Computing ', ' cloud computer ', ' Cloud Infrastructure ', ' cloud based ', ' service learning ', ' service-based learning ', ' social media ', ' Data Analytics ', ' software as a service ', ' Internet of Things ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' ']",NIGMS,"ROCKSTEP SOLUTIONS, INC.",R44,2017,739402,ME-01,0.021695877813484088
"Semantic Data Lake for Biomedical Research Capitalizing on the transformative opportunities afforded by the extremely large and ever-growing volume, velocity, and variety of biomedical data being continuously produced is a major challenge. The development and increasingly widespread adoption of several new technologies, including next generation genetic sequencing, electronic health records and clinical trials systems, and research data warehouses means that we are in the midst of a veritable explosion in data production. This in turn results in the migration of the bottleneck in scientific productivity into data management and interpretation: tools are urgently needed to assist cancer researchers in the assembly, integration, transformation, and analysis of these Big Data sets. In this project, we propose to develop the Semantic Data Lake for Biomedical Research (SDL-BR) system, a cluster-computing software environment that enables rapid data ingestion, multifaceted data modeling, logical and semantic querying and data transformation, and intelligent resource discovery. SDL-BR is based on the idea of a data lake, a distributed store that does not make any assumptions about the structure of incoming data, and that delays modeling decisions until data is to be used.

"Novel Methods for Evaluation and Implementation of Behavioral Intervention Technologies for Depression ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Major depressive disorder (MDD) is projected to be a leading cause of burden of disease globally and in the United States. In the United States, in 2012 alone, an estimated 16 million adults aged 18 or older (7% of all adults) had at least one major depressive episode. While psychological treatments are effective at treating depression, the high prevalence of MDD makes it impossible to meet the needs in the population with standard one-to-one intensive psychological treatments. Behavioral intervention technologies (BITs) use technologies such as mobile phones to support behavior change to improve mental health, and have been shown to have similar effects to psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy. With the growing number of mobile phone users, BIT is a viable and promising option for delivering psychotherapy. On the other hand, the current evaluation framework of new interventions is not adequate for evaluating and implementing BITs, because of the rapidly evolving BIT landscape and the complexity of the interventions. This research aims to develop and validate novel concepts and evaluation framework to address these two challenges in the dissemination and implementation of BITs in MDD patients in pragmatic settings. We plan to achieve this research goal in four steps. First, we will develop a new statistical design, called open-ended adaptive randomization (OAR) procedure, which will enable us to continuously evaluate BITs that enter and leave a care delivery system. The OAR also aims to improve quality of care given to the participating patients, by sequentially allocating patients away from inferior BITs based on the interim evidence during deployment. Second, we will develop a data analytical technique, called regularized Q-learning, which will enable us to perform variable selection in high-dimensional settings and retain only the important predictors of health outcomes in the learning model. While the original Q-learning is a cutting-edge technique originating from the computer science literature, the research will extend its capability to handle high-dimensional data and enrich the learning model by incorporating regularized regression. Third, we will prepare for the next implementation phase of the proposed methods, by calibrating the methods with computer simulations, creating an initial knowledge base by analyzing data from current randomized clinical trials, identifying partnerships with healthcare providers and app curation plaftorms. Fourth, we will advocate for the general implementation of the proposed methods by producing publications, building cognitive computing systems, and tracking the source of citation and adoption of the published results by the broader health research community. Our long-term goal is to enhance our capability of deploying complex interventions such as BITs to depressed patients in a personalized and evidence-based manner throughout the healthcare system. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is common, and imposes a high societal cost in terms of quality of life, work productivity, functional status, morbidity and mortality. The national healthcare system will not be able to meet the needs in the population with standard one-to-one intensive psychological treatments. With the growing number of smartphone use, behavioral intervention technologies have become a viable and scalable option to deliver psychotherapy to the population. This research proposes novel evaluation and implementation concepts and methods that aim to extend our capacity to adopt these technologies in an evidence-based manner.",Novel Methods for Evaluation and Implementation of Behavioral Intervention Technologies for Depression,9276137,R01MH109496,"['Accounting ', ' Adoption ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anxiety ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' computing system ', ' Computer Systems ', ' Computers ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' drug treatment ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Elements ', ' Engineering ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Services Research ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' single episode major depressive disorder ', ' single episode Major Depression ', ' major depressive episode ', ' Single major depressive episode ', ' Single major depression ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity -

"Research and development of an open, extensible, web-based information extraction workbench for systematic review Project Summary  1 More than 4,000 systematic reviews are performed each year in the fields of environmental health and evidence-based  2 medicine, with each review requiring, on average, between six months to one year of effort to complete. One of the most  3 time consuming and repetitive aspects of this endeavor involves extraction of detailed information from a large number  4 of scientific documents. The specific data items extracted differ among disciplines, but within a given scientific domain,  5 certain data points are extracted repeatedly for each review conducted. Research on use of natural language processing  6 (NLP) for extracting individual data elements has shown that it has the potential to greatly reduce the laborious, time  7 intensive, and repetitive nature of this step. However, there is currently no integrated, automatic data extraction platform  8 that meets the needs of the systematic review community. We propose a web-based data extraction software platform  9 specifically designed for usage in the domain of systematic review. By combining multiple state-of-the-art data extraction 10 methods utilizing NLP, text mining and machine learning, into a single, unified user interface, we will thereby empower 11 the end-user with a powerful and novel tool for automating an otherwise arduous task. 12 The research we propose encompasses three specific aims: (1) develop new data extraction models using deep learning 13 and a new technique called “data programming”; (2) develop a web-based platform to semi-automate the process; (3) 14 design protocols and standards for packaging extraction models as software components and integrating work done by 15 other research groups and vendors. In the first aim, we will contribute novel data extraction modules designed and 16 trained specifically to extract data elements of interest to those conducting systematic reviews in the domain of 17 environmental health. For this research, we will employ state-of-the-art machine learning, NLP and text mining 18 methodologies to train and evaluate several novel extraction components. In our second aim, we will develop a web- 19 based workbench which will allow users to upload scientific documents for automated data extraction. Our system will 20 also be designed to allow for integration of data extraction approaches (components) from other research groups, thus 21 enabling end users to choose from a wide variety of advanced data extraction methodologies within one unified and 22 intuitive software environment. In our third aim, we will develop new protocols to standardize the inputs and outputs 23 for data extraction components. The resulting interface, which will enable seamless integration of third party extraction 24 components into the workbench, will also facilitate the incorporation of feedback from users such that extraction 25 components can be continuously improved based on real-time data. 26 Our overarching goal is to translate emerging semi-automated extraction technologies out of the lab and into practical 27 software and to bring to market both the software itself as well as several premium data extraction components. The 28 results of the research conducted for Aims 1-3 represent the first step in this direction and will provide the foundation for 29 future developments. These result will take us one step closer to the dream of creating “living systematic reviews,” which 30 are maintained using automated or semi-automated methods and updated regularly as new evidence becomes available. Project Narrative Systematic review is a formal process used widely in evidence-based medicine and environmental health research to identify, assess, and integrate the primary scientific literature with the goal of answering a specific, targeted question in pursuit of the current scientific consensus. By conducting research and development to build a flexible, extensible software system that automates the crucial and resource-intensive process of extracting key data elements from scientific documents, we will make an important contribution toward ongoing efforts to automate systematic review. These efforts will serve to make systematic reviews both more efficient to produce and less expensive to maintain, a result which will greatly accelerate the process by which scientific consensus is obtained in a variety of medical and health-related disciplines having great public significance.","Research and development of an open, extensible, web-based information extraction workbench for systematic review",9623091,R43ES029901,"['Communities ', ' Dreams ', ' dreaming ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Health ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Feedback ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Literature ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Online Systems ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Standardization ', ' Supervision ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Vendor ', ' Work ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' Intuition ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Consensus ', ' Evidence Based Medicine ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' One-Step dentin bonding system ', ' One Step ', ' interest ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' model design ', ' text searching ', ' text mining ', ' literature searching ', ' literature mining ', ' discovery mining ', ' Data ', ' Data Element ', ' Update ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Output ', ' systematic review ', ' data integration ', ' software systems ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' evidence base ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' artificial neural network ', ' deep learning ', ' ']",NIEHS,"SCIOME, LLC",R43,2018,225000,NC-04,-0.0319047033285478
"Device for real-time streaming of preclinical research data into a central cloud-based platform Project Summary BehaviorCloud is a unified cloud platform where biomedical researchers can collect, analyze, and share preclinical research data – specifically behavioral and phenotype data from animal models. Traditionally researchers collect data from many disparate instruments and store data on PCs running single license software. Raw data is stored across several locations, analysis is restricted to the PC used to collect the data, and opportunities for collaboration, remote-participation, and data sharing are limited. BehaviorCloud is leveraging cloud data streaming and storage to overcome these barriers to discovery. In 2017 BehaviorCloud released a first version of the underlying cloud platform as well as BehaviorCloud Camera, an open-source “reference implementation” that demonstrates automated video tracking of animal behavior on the BehaviorCloud platform using a consumer-grade smartphone. This tool and the underlying platform are both in active use across academic and pharmaceutical labs. The aim of this Phase I SBIR application is to develop patent-pending “Bridge” technology that allows data streaming from third-party instrumentation into the central web platform. Researchers will bypass the original software and PCs associated with their instruments to control trials through their BehaviorCloud account and receive data back in real-time. BehaviorCloud will provide a public repository to aggregate all of these data and accelerate discovery by providing computational tools for large-scale meta-analysis and machine learning based predictive analytics. Project Narrative BehaviorCloud is a unified cloud platform where biomedical researchers can collect, analyze, and share preclinical research data – specifically behavioral and phenotype data from animal models.

"Non-invasive device to assist selecting the level-of-amputation in patients with peripheral arterial disease 1 Abstract  2  3 This is a Phase I SBIR proposal to develop a non-contact and non-invasive imaging device for assisting clinicians  4 in selecting the appropriate level-of-amputation (LOA) in limbs with peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Surgeons  5 prefer to salvage as much limb tissue as possible during amputation to increase patient mobility while decreasing  6 morbidity and mortality. However, clinicians must balance this preference against the likelihood of primary wound  7 healing at a given level of amputation (LOA), which decreases with more distal amputations. There are no gold-  8 standard tests to aid clinicians in selecting the LOA in patients with PAD, therefore reported rates of re-  9 amputation in current practice are substantial. Up to 20% percent of above-the-knee amputations to 35% of 10 foot amputations require revision to a more proximal level. Furthermore, physician awareness of the risk for 11 re-amputation may lead to overly aggressive selection of LOA to more proximal levels in some cases. Indeed, 12 certain patients may receive amputations at a level more proximal than is necessary because their surgeon could 13 not confidently predict a high likelihood of healing at a more distal level. 14 15 In current practice, selection of LOA is determined qualitatively by clinical judgment of the surgeon using patient 16 history and physical exam. Others have developed quantitative tests that assess local microcirculation. These 17 technologies have not superseded clinical judgement. To address this critical problem, SpectralMD is 18 developing an imaging device that integrates multispectral imaging with a machine learning algorithm 19 to provide a quantitative assessment of the healing potential of a selected LOA whereas current clinical 20 practice is only capable of qualitative assessment. 21 22 We have proof-of-concept of our technology’s ability to characterize microvascular blood flow changes in a 23 patient with critical limb ischemia. In this proposal, we intend to establish the utility of our device for predicting 24 the healing potential of a clinician selected LOA by demonstrating the effectiveness of DeepView assessment 25 on a large set of pre-amputation images. To this end we will conduct a Phase I pilot study for the use of our 26 device in predicting the healing potential of a clinician selected LOA. This clinical study will develop a data set 27 for training the algorithm, and deliver a clear demonstration of feasibility for completing the development on an 28 algorithm that has high accuracy in predicting the healing potential of the proposed amputation site. Following 29 this work, we will apply for a Phase II proposal intended to finalize algorithm training, validate the algorithm 30 developed in Phase I, and establish a successful regulatory and commercialization pathway. Narrative In patients with peripheral arterial disease, reported rates of re-amputation due to non-healing of a primary amputation are very significant—approximately 20% of below-the-knee amputations require eventual revision, with even higher rates established for amputations at the level of the foot. There are no gold-standard tests for selection of level of amputation (LOA) to aid clinical judgment. To address this critical problem, SpectralMD is developing the DeepView-Gen2 imaging device that integrates multispectral imaging and a machine learning algorithm to quantitatively measure microvascular blood flow and tissue healing potential to assist in the clinical selection of LOA and minimize the incidence of re-amputation and its associated morbidity and mortality.",Non-invasive device to assist selecting the level-of-amputation in patients with peripheral arterial disease,9622035,R43HL142428,"['Algorithms ', ' Amputation ', ' Ankle ', ' Tarsus ', ' Tarsal Bone ', ' Regio tarsalis ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Awareness ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Data Reporting ', ' data representation ', ' Elements ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Limb structure ', ' Non-Trunk ', ' Limbs ', ' Extremities ', ' foot ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' Ischemia ', ' Judgment ', ' Knee ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lower Extremity ', ' Membrum inferius ', ' Lower Limb ', ' Microcirculation ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Postoperative Period ', ' Postoperative ', ' Post-Operative ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Risk ', ' Specificity ', ' Standardization ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Work ', ' Wound Healing ', ' Wound Repair ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Practice Guidelines ', ' Secondary to ', ' base ', ' Distal ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Training ', ' Blood flow ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' Sample Size ', ' Personal Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Personal Medical History ', ' Medical History ', ' Contracts ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Investigation ', ' System ', ' preference ', ' Surgeon ', ' success ', ' Skin Tissue ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Imaging Device ', ' Imaging Tool ', ' Imaging Instrument ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' peripheral artery disease ', ' Peripheral arterial disease ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' healing ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' wound ', ' commercialization ', ' standard of care ', ' clinical practice ', ' Phase I Study ', ' phase 1 study ', ' clinical risk ', ' noninvasive imaging ', ' non-invasive imaging ', ' patient mobility ', ' ']",NHLBI,"SPECTRAL MD, INC.",R43,2018,196561,TX-30,0.014688520174623656
"LifeSense: Transforming Behavioral Assessment of Depression Using Personal Sensing Technology Abstract Depression is common, costly, and a leading cause of disability. Assessment of behavior and experience related to depression has tended to rely on self-report and interview-based methods. Environmental momentary assessment inserts assessment into people's lives, but still requires active engagement by those being evaluated. We propose to develop and validate a mobile phone-based personal sensing system to detect depression and related behaviors that relies on sensor data that are collected continuously and unobtrusively. Because people tend to keep their phones with them, the mobile phone is an ideal sensing platform, as it can continuously collect data in the context of the individual's life with no ongoing effort on the part of the user. Such systems are already being used to detect simple behaviors, such as activity recognition and sleep quantification, which are more proximal to the sensor data. Aim 1 will develop markers for a broad range of behavioral targets related to symptoms of major depressive episode (MDE; anhedonia, negative mood, sleep disruption, psychomotor activity, fatigue, and diminished concentration) and related domains (e.g. social functioning, stress, motivation) across a representative sample of participants. Aim 2 will combine all behavioral targets using machine learning to 1) estimate MDE and symptom severity cross-sectionally, 2) identify transition from non-depressed to depressed states, and depressed to non-depressed states, and 3) predict MDE and symptom severity 4 and 8 weeks out. Aim 3 will seek to understand the complex relationships among behavioral targets and depression. We will accomplish this by enrolling 1200 representative participants, in six 4-month waves of data collection. Each participant will download software that collects a wide variety of sensor data (GPS, accelerometry, light, Bluetooth, phone usage, etc.) and an app that collects ecological momentary assessments (EMA). Following each wave we will develop algorithms for a subset of behavioral targets and features (a definition of raw sensor data that incorporates meaning, like translating GPS data into “home”). Each algorithm will then be validated in the subsequent wave. After 5 waves (1000 participants), the set of all markers of behavioral targets and features will be combined using machine learning to detect and predict depression. This hierarchical approach extracts information from data at multiple levels, which ultimately is far more likely to succeed than relying solely on raw sensor data. The final wave will serve to replicate and validate the entire depression prediction model. This sensing platform is scientifically significant, as it will provide a fundamentally new tool for obtaining continuous, objective markers of behavior that are relevant to depression, as well as many other psychiatric and medical disorders. This project has the potential develop new understandings into the etiology of depression. It is clinically significant, as it will allow for continuous, effortless assessment of populations at risk for depression and ongoing evaluation during treatment. Project Narrative We propose to develop a sensing platform that uses mobile phone sensor data to detect a broad range of behaviors related to depression, as well as detect and predict depressive states that require treatment. This system will be able to run unobtrusively and continuously on people's phones. This sensing platform will provide a fundamentally new method of obtaining continuous, objective markers of behavior that are relevant to depression, as well as many other psychiatric and medical disorders.",LifeSense: Transforming Behavioral Assessment of Depression Using Personal Sensing Technology,9515970,R01MH111610,"['Algorithms ', ' Behavior ', ' Sampling Biases ', ' Systematic Bias ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Data Collection ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Fatigue ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human Activities ', ' Interview ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' single episode major depressive disorder ', ' single episode Major Depression ', ' major depressive episode ', ' Single major depressive episode ', ' Single major depression ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Motivation ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Persons ', ' Noise ', ' Periodicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Psychologist ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Rewards ', ' Running ', ' Sleep ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Stress ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Textiles ', ' fabric ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Measures ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Anhedonia ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Evaluation ', ' disability ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Measurement ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Depressed mood ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Life ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' computer science ', ' Structure ', ' pleasure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Devices ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' Genomics ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Car Phone ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Behavior assessment ', ' behavioral assessment ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Collection ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Monitor ', ' Text ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Social Functioning ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' next generation ', ' touchscreen panel ', ' touch screen panel ', ' touch screen ', ' touch panel ', ' touchscreen ', ' negative mood ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinically significant ', ' health application ', ' wi-fi ', ' wireless fidelity ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' treatment response ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' activity tracker ', ' activity monitor ', ' accelerometry ', ' Accelerometer ', ' Bluetooth ', ' sensing technology ', ' sensor technology ', ' wearable sensor ', ' wearable device ', ' ']",NIMH,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2018,802874,IL-07,-0.009940426045506871
"Novel Methods for Evaluation and Implementation of Behavioral Intervention Technologies for Depression ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Major depressive disorder (MDD) is projected to be a leading cause of burden of disease globally and in the United States. In the United States, in 2012 alone, an estimated 16 million adults aged 18 or older (7% of all adults) had at least one major depressive episode. While psychological treatments are effective at treating depression, the high prevalence of MDD makes it impossible to meet the needs in the population with standard one-to-one intensive psychological treatments. Behavioral intervention technologies (BITs) use technologies such as mobile phones to support behavior change to improve mental health, and have been shown to have similar effects to psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy. With the growing number of mobile phone users, BIT is a viable and promising option for delivering psychotherapy. On the other hand, the current evaluation framework of new interventions is not adequate for evaluating and implementing BITs, because of the rapidly evolving BIT landscape and the complexity of the interventions. This research aims to develop and validate novel concepts and evaluation framework to address these two challenges in the dissemination and implementation of BITs in MDD patients in pragmatic settings. We plan to achieve this research goal in four steps. First, we will develop a new statistical design, called open-ended adaptive randomization (OAR) procedure, which will enable us to continuously evaluate BITs that enter and leave a care delivery system. The OAR also aims to improve quality of care given to the participating patients, by sequentially allocating patients away from inferior BITs based on the interim evidence during deployment. Second, we will develop a data analytical technique, called regularized Q-learning, which will enable us to perform variable selection in high-dimensional settings and retain only the important predictors of health outcomes in the learning model. While the original Q-learning is a cutting-edge technique originating from the computer science literature, the research will extend its capability to handle high-dimensional data and enrich the learning model by incorporating regularized regression. Third, we will prepare for the next implementation phase of the proposed methods, by calibrating the methods with computer simulations, creating an initial knowledge base by analyzing data from current randomized clinical trials, identifying partnerships with healthcare providers and app curation plaftorms. Fourth, we will advocate for the general implementation of the proposed methods by producing publications, building cognitive computing systems, and tracking the source of citation and adoption of the published results by the broader health research community. Our long-term goal is to enhance our capability of deploying complex interventions such as BITs to depressed patients in a personalized and evidence-based manner throughout the healthcare system. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is common, and imposes a high societal cost in terms of quality of life, work productivity, functional status, morbidity and mortality. The national healthcare system will not be able to meet the needs in the population with standard one-to-one intensive psychological treatments. With the growing number of smartphone use, behavioral intervention technologies have become a viable and scalable option to deliver psychotherapy to the population. This research proposes novel evaluation and implementation concepts and methods that aim to extend our capacity to adopt these technologies in an evidence-based manner.",Novel Methods for Evaluation and Implementation of Behavioral Intervention Technologies for Depression,9412888,R01MH109496,"['Accounting ', ' Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anxiety ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Systems ', ' computing system ', ' Computers ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Elements ', ' Engineering ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Services Research ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' single episode major depressive disorder ', ' single episode Major Depression ', ' major depressive episode ', ' Single major depressive episode ', ' Single major depression ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity -

"Development and Evaluation of a Learning Electronic Medical Record System ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of this project to develop and evaluate a learning electronic medical records (L-EMR) system that draws a physician's attention to the right data, at the right time. It learns how to do so by analyzing patterns of patient data access f many physicians in many past cases in the EMR, and learning which EMR data to highlight that are relevant for making clinical decisions in a given patient.      The hypothesis underlying this research is that the L-EMR system will have sufficiently high precision and recall in highlighting relevant data, decrease the average time to assess an intensive care unit (ICU) patient case, and be judged by critical care medicine (CCM) physicians to be clinically useful.    The first aim of this project is develop a highly-usable L-EMR user interface. The L-EMR user interface will include zoomable time-series displays of lab-results, med-orders, and vital signs. Usability studies of the L-EMR user interface will guide revisions and enhancements.      The second aim of the project is to train statistical models that can be applied to a patient case to predict relevant lab-results, med-orders, and vital signs. We will enlist CCM physicians to review a set of retrospective ICU patient cases on a focused set of clinical conditions. Participants will review these cases as if they were active patients, identifying relevant lab- results, med-orders, and vital signs. We will train and evaluate statistical models to predict relevant data, and identify the best performing algorithm to include in the L-EMR system.      The third aim of the project is to evaluate the L-EMR system. We will recruit CCM physicians to evaluate an L-EMR system based on user interfaces from Aim 1 and statistical models trained using the best performing algorithm in Aim 2 to highlight relevant data items. We will measure the precision and recall of the data-highlighting functionality for assessing patient cases and making clinical decisions (e.g., lab and medication orders), the time required to assess cases with and without the highlighting, and physicians' assessments of the strengths and weaknesses of the L-EMR system.    If the results of these experiments are positive, as anticipated, this project will introduce a computational method that has significant potential to improve future EMR systems and enhance patient care. Narrative The purpose of this research is to develop and evaluate a learning electronic medical records (EMR) system that draws a physician's attention to the right data, at the right time. The system works by analyzing patterns of EMR usage of physicians, and learning which EMR data to highlight that are relevant in a given patient. The main idea underlying the approach is that patterns of past EMR usage patterns can be exploited to selectively highlight clinically useful patient data.",Development and Evaluation of a Learning Electronic Medical Record System,9521586,R01LM012095,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Algorithms ', ' Attention ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' E-learning ', ' web-based training ', ' web-based instruction ', ' virtual learning ', ' virtual education ', ' technology-enhanced learning ', ' online learning ', ' online education ', ' multimedia learning ', ' internet-based training ', ' internet-assisted education ', ' electronic learning ', ' eLearning ', ' digital learning ', ' digital education ', ' computer-based training ', ' computer-based learning ', ' computer-based instruction ', ' computer-based education ', ' computer-assisted instruction ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Critical Care ', ' Critical Illness ', ' Critically Ill ', ' Data Display ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Future ', ' Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage ', ' gastrointestinal bleeding ', ' GI hemorrhage ', ' GI bleeding ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Hemoglobin ', ' Information Systems ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Intensive Care Units ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' man-machine interaction ', ' computer human interaction ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Series ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Measurement ', ' Intravenous ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Medical Errors ', ' Medical Mistakes ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Test Result ', ' American ', ' Participant ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Clinical Management ', ' clinical test ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' research clinical testing ', ' trend ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' prospective ', ' usability ', ' stem ', ' prototype ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' Bayesian tracking algorithms ', ' Bayesian statistical models ', ' Bayesian spatial models ', ' Bayesian spatial image models ', ' Bayesian spatial data model ', ' Bayesian nonparametric models ', ' Bayesian network model ', ' Bayesian hierarchical model ', ' Bayesian framework ', ' Bayesian belief updating model ', ' Bayesian belief network ', ' Bayesian adaptive models ', ' Bayesian adaptive designs ', ' Bayesian Modeling ', ' data access ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,452158,PA-18,0.00774797562764427
"Customized Health Alerts and Consumer-Centered Interfaces Using In-Home and Wearable Sensors In-home sensing technologies hold enormous potential for early detection of health changes that can dramatically affect the experiences of aging: enabling functional independence, improving self-management of chronic or acute conditions, and improving quality of life. Chronic diseases especially affect older adults. Problems in chronic disease management are often the cause of losing independence for aging Americans. In 2012, 1 in 2 American adults (117 million) had at least one chronic condition, and 26% of the population had multiple chronic conditions, accounting for 84% of US health care costs. Early illness recognition and early treatment is key to improving health status with rapid recovery after an exacerbation of a chronic illness or acute illness, and also key to reducing morbidity and mortality in older adults and controlling health care costs.  In previous work, the team developed a health alert system that captures and analyzes data from sensors embedded in the home. Sensor data are captured passively and continuously in the home. In a pilot NIH R21 study, significant differences in health outcomes were shown with health alerts from motion and bed sensor data, based on bed restlessness and low, normal, and high pulse and respiration rates. The system actually detected changes in chronic diseases or acute illnesses on average 10 days to 2 weeks before usual assessment methods or self-reports of illness. For this project, the team will expand from the clinician-focused system to a consumer-focused system by incorporating more finely grained sensing (gait and quantitative pulse and respiration), with new improved algorithms that integrate individual health status and medication use, and track trajectories of health changes, for more sensitive, and more personalized health alerts with fewer false alarms. A recently developed bed sensor will be incorporated to passively capture quantitative pulse, respiration, and restlessness while the subject is resting. Gait parameters (e.g., in-home walking speed, stride time and stride length) will also be captured using depth images that show shadowy silhouettes. In addition, the team will solicit the consumer perspective on customized health alerts and a user interface for displaying sensor and alert information. The views of seniors and their family members will be used to inform the development of the new customized alert algorithms and drive the development of a consumer-focused interface that will provide empowering tools for self-management of chronic illnesses. In addition, the use of commercially available wrist-worn sensors will be explored for the purpose of recognizing health changes. The study will include a retrospective analysis of sensor data collected in 13 senior housing sites in Missouri. New participants will be recruited in 5 senior housing sites in Columbia, MO to investigate the consumer perspective. The important process of engaging consumers in this work is the next step in translating these systems into clinical practice for self-managing chronic health conditions, supporting seniors living independently. PROJECT NARRATIVE We will build on our current work using intelligent, in-home sensor systems with automated health alerts to investigate new health alert algorithms that are more sensitive and more customized to the individual. These will be tested with data from 13 senior housing sites in Missouri using clinician feedback and actual health trajectories for evaluation. We will also recruit subjects in independent living housing to solicit the views of consumers on wearable sensors, health alerts, and user interfaces that allow seniors and their family members to view the health alert information in a way that empowers them to better self-manage their own health.",Customized Health Alerts and Consumer-Centered Interfaces Using In-Home and Wearable Sensors,9355893,R01NR016423,"['Accounting ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' Beds ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Family ', ' Feedback ', ' Gait ', ' Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Housing ', ' Independent Living ', ' Length of Stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital days ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' Methods ', ' Missouri ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Motion ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' nursing home ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Respiration ', ' respiratory mechanism ', ' Rest ', ' Retrospective Studies ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Wrist ', ' Privacy ', ' Walking ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Agitation ', ' Restlessness ', ' Psychomotor Restlessness ', ' Psychomotor Hyperactivity ', ' Psychomotor Excitement ', ' Psychomotor Agitation ', ' Family member ', ' Self Management ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Hospitalization cost ', ' Hospital Costs ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Early Intervention ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Disease Management ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Pulse ', ' Complex ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' preference ', ' empowered ', ' American ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Prevention ', ' fall risk ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' fitness ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' active control ', ' cost ', ' information display ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' early therapy ', ' Early treatment ', ' clinical practice ', ' multimorbidity ', ' multiple chronic conditions ', ' walking pace ', ' walking speed ', ' differences in health ', ' health difference ', ' recruit ', ' sensing technology ', ' sensor technology ', ' wearable sensor ', ' wearable device ', ' health assessment ', ' Grain ', ' ']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R01,2018,485014,MO-04,-0.005660023432209269
"Slicer+PLUS: Collaborative, open-source software for ultrasound analysis Abstract The target users of the proposed Slicer+PLUS framework are researchers and developers who are focusing on low-cost point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) applications. POCUS applications are characterized by utilizing low-cost, portable U/S systems; in the hands of novice operators; with novel data acquisition, signal processing, and machine learning methods; with imprecise trackers; and in highly unconstrained point-of-care environments, e.g.: at the scene of accidents for patient triage, in the offices of general practitioners for scoliosis detection and monitoring, in patients' homes for an aging population, as well as throughout hospitals. In these contexts, many are considering POCUS devices to be the stethoscopes of the future.  The foundation of Slicer+PLUS is the integration and extension of 3D Slicer, PLUS, and MUSiiC. We are the developers of these libraries. We, and the users of our libraries, are proposing Slicer+PLUS so that the Slicer, PLUS, and MUSiiC communities can come together and cohesively address the important challenges and opportunities posed by POCUS applications. Over 30 letters of support are included with this application.  3D Slicer is a world-class, freely available open-source platform for medical image segmentation, registration, and visualization. PLUS is a world-class, open-source library for communicating with ultrasound machines and trackers (for following objects in 3D using magnetic, optical, and other technologies). MUSiiC is a (previously closed source) library that focuses on advanced ultrasound acquisition and analysis methods, such as ultrasound reconstruction pipelines, elastography, and photoacoustic imaging. Together, these toolkits have averaged over 5,100 downloads per month for the past year.  A central tenant of our work is that POCUS applications should not be viewed as simply involving the use of inexpensive, portable U/S systems; POCUS must be viewed as a new modality for it to attain its full potential. POCUS must involve innovative, automated data analysis methods and workflows that can guide a user to properly place and manipulate an ultrasound probe and interpret the returned ultrasound data. In particular, the output of those workflows and analyses should be quantitative measures, not b-mode images, since the expertise to interpret such images will not be readily available at points-of-care. To that end, the proposed work goes well beyond simple integration of Slicer, PLUS, and MUSiiC. Multiple innovations are proposed such as Ultrasound Spectroscopy for tissue labeling, Dynamic Textures for anatomic localization of ultrasound probes, and self-tracking ultrasound probes.  To assess our progress towards our goals, our team includes our target users: researchers, medical device manufacturers, and clinical innovators dedicated to low-cost POCUS applications. They will be validating our efforts by integrating them into their research and translational POCUS product development projects. Project Narrative  Low-cost ultrasound probes have the potential to become the stethoscopes of the future and revolutionize in-field and in-hospital patient care. Our goal is to integrate, enhance, and disseminate three cutting edge ultrasound acquisition, analysis, and display toolkits to create a new framework called Slicer+PLUS that will serve as a catalyst for research and product development into low-cost point-of-care ultrasound applications. In particular, our framework will include and facilitate innovative methods for guiding a novice user in ultrasound probe placement and for automatically interpreting ultrasound data to provide a diagnosis, without the user having to interpret a traditional B-mode ultrasound image at any point in the process. The Slicer+PLUS framework will be validated using tasks associated with (a) emergency service personnel performing Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) exams at the scene of an accident to detect or rule-out intra-abdominal bleeding; (b) the clinical monitoring of scoliosis progression in children in general practitioners' offices; and (c) the translation of research into regulatory-approved products based on Slicer+PLUS.","Slicer+PLUS: Collaborative, open-source software for ultrasound analysis",9535994,R01EB021396,"['Abdomen ', ' Abdominal ', ' Accidents ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Emergency medical service ', ' emergency service ', ' Environment ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' General Practitioners ', ' Generalists ', ' Goals ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' blood loss ', ' Bleeding ', ' Hospitals ', ' Libraries ', ' Medical Device ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Patients ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Support ', ' scoliosis ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Spectrum Analysis ', ' Spectrum Analyses ', ' Spectroscopy ', ' Vertebral column ', ' backbone ', ' Spine ', ' Spinal Column ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Ultrasonography ', ' ultrasound scanning ', ' ultrasound imaging ', ' ultrasound ', ' sound measurement ', ' sonography ', ' sonogram ', ' diagnostic ultrasound ', ' Ultrasound Test ', ' Ultrasound Medical Imaging ', ' Ultrasound Diagnosis ', ' Ultrasonogram ', ' Ultrasonic Imaging ', ' Medical Ultrasound ', ' Echotomography ', ' Echography ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Visualization ', ' Imagery ', ' catalyst ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' Stethoscopes ', ' Clinical ', ' Letters ', ' Shapes ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Life ', ' Frequencies ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Source ', ' Texture ', ' System ', ' Magnetism ', ' magnetic ', ' innovative technologies ', ' hospital patient care ', ' cohesion ', ' novel ', ' Modality ', ' Devices ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' software development ', ' developing computer software ', ' develop software ', ' portability ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Documentation ', ' Manufacturer Name ', ' Manufacturer ', ' image guided therapy ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Intra-abdominal ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research ', ' Monitor ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' point of care ', ' first responder ', ' emergency service responder ', ' emergency service personnel ', ' Emergency responder ', ' emergency service/first responder ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Output ', ' cost ', ' reconstruction ', ' 3D analysis ', ' 3-dimensional analysis ', ' 3-D analysis ', ' Three-dimensional analysis ', ' Trauma ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' imaging Segmentation ', ' data acquisition ', ' open source ', ' population aging ', ' aged population ', ' aging population ', ' product development ', ' optoacoustic imaging ', ' photoacoustic imaging ', ' elastography ', ' signal processing ', ' Patient Triage ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' clinical translation ', ' ']",NIBIB,"KITWARE, INC.",R01,2018,544363,NY-20,0.04734912538163165
"Characterization of the manifestation of stages and processes of smoking behavior change in health-related social intercourse Title: Characterization of the manifestation of stages and processes of smoking behavior change in health-related social intercourse Abstract  Chronic disease management is largely dependent upon individuals’ engagement in adoption and modification of one or more health behaviors (e.g. medication adherence, daily exercise, smoking cessation) over long term. Despite prevalence of theory-guided behavior change interventions, behavior modification is oftentimes a chronic, relapsing effort in and of itself. The effect of social relationships and behavior change has been well documented, nonetheless, rarely infused into health interventions. Our understanding of (a) the mechanisms through which such influence affects human behaviors, and (b) how such influence can be harnessed to improve the effectiveness of theory-guided behavioral interventions is limited. In the proposed research, we will develop a set of semi-automated methods to characterize the interrelation between theory driven stages of behavior change and social influence models of human behavior in group settings, as embedded in user generated interactions on a health-related online community. While generally applicable, the methods will be developed based on communications among individuals attempting to quit smoking in an online community, QuitNet, the first online social network for smoking cessation. Advanced text analytics will be used to identify and extract the stages and processes of behavior change. Stage-oriented network affiliation models will then be used to characterize the interdependencies among social actors, behavioral processes, and behavioral states. This research proposal will result in 1) novel methods to incorporate behavioral stages and processes into network models of social influence; 2) scalable techniques to automate identification of behavioral stage through text annotation of user interactions; and 3) new proposals for the development of digital interventions and technology features that harness social ties and theoretical roots to support individuals engaging in health behavior change and chronic disease management.     This project investigates the manifestation of behavior change processes and stages in online social discourse focusing smoking cessation.

"Integrate Dynamic System Model and Machine Learning for Calibration-Free Noninvasive ICP Project Summary  No clinical device exists for noninvasive intracranial pressure (nICP) assessment. Past attempts have focused on identifying ICP-related signals that are noninvasively measureable, but have done little to address the calibration problem. Without calibration, only ICP trending can be inferred at the best. However, noninvasive calibration is not trivial. A universal calibration will fail because individual patients require different calibration to obtain accurate results. On the other hand, the use of plain regression for individualized calibration is infeasible because ICP cannot be obtained noninvasively for a de novo patient to begin with.  Invasive ICP monitoring remains a standard of care and this can be leveraged to continuously grow a database of ICP, noninvasive signals, and different calibration equations, e.g., each built from a pair of invasive ICP and noninvasive signal in the database. Then nICP becomes feasible by selecting from a rich set of calibration equations the optimal choice for a de novo patient. In this project, we will pursue three aims that will lead to the development of an accurate noninvasive ICP system based on Transcranial Doppler. These aims are: 1) To implement and validate core algorithms needed for achieving accurate nICP; 2) To test if estimated nICP is sensitive to variations in ultrasound probe placement; 3) To test the generalizability of the proposed nICP approach.  Large epidemiologic surveys reveal that ICP is monitored in only about 58% of US patients when ICP monitoring is indicated. It is a smaller percentage (37%) in European patients and even fewer in developing countries. The proposed nICP approach does not have the high risks associated with invasive ICP, requires no onsite neurosurgical expertise, and can be economically deployed and readily practiced. Therefore, its potential impact is enormous. Project Narrative  No clinically accepted device exists for noninvasive intracranial pressure (ICP) assessment.

"The Human Body Atlas: High-Resolution, Functional Mapping of Voxel, Vector, and Meta Datasets Project Summary/Abstract The ultimate goal of the HIVE Mapping effort is to develop a common coordinate framework (CCF) for the healthy human body that supports the cataloguing of different types of individual cells, understanding the func- tion and relationships between those cell types, and modeling their individual and collective function. In order to exploit human and machine intelligence, different visual interfaces will be implemented that use the CCF in support of data exploration and communication. The proposed effort combines decades of expertise in data and network visualization, scientific visualization, mathematical biology, and biomedical data standards to develop a highly accurate and extensible multidimen- sional spatial basemap of the human body and associated data overlays that can be interactively explored online as an atlas of tissue maps. To implement this functionality, we will develop methods to map and connect metadata, pixel/voxel data, and extracted vector data, allowing users to “navigate” across the human body along multiple functional contexts (e.g., systems physiology, vascular, or endocrine systems), and connect and integrate further computational, analytical, visualization, and biometric resources as driven by the context or “position” on the map. The CCF and the interactive data visualizations will be multi-level and multi-scale sup- porting the exploration and communication of tissue and publication data--from single cell to whole body. In the first year, the proposed Mapping Component will run user needs analyses, compile an initial CCF using pre-existing classifications and ontologies; implement two interactive data visualizations; and evaluate the usa- bility and effectiveness of the CCF and associated visualizations in formal user studies. Project Narrative This project will create a high-resolution, functional mapping of voxel, vector, and meta datasets in support of integration, interoperability, and visualization of biomedical HuBMAP data and models. We will create an ex- tensible common coordinate framework (CCF) to facilitate the integration of diverse image-based data at spa- tial scales ranging from the molecular to the anatomical. This project will work in close coordination with the HuBMAP consortium to help drive an ecosystem of useful resources for understanding and leveraging high- resolution human image data and to compile a human body atlas.","The Human Body Atlas: High-Resolution, Functional Mapping of Voxel, Vector, and Meta Datasets",9687220,OT2OD026671,"['Anatomy ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Atlases ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Cataloging ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Endocrine system ', ' endocrine gland/system ', ' Metabolic/Endocrine Body System ', ' Hormonal System ', ' Endocrine/Metabolic Organ System ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Physiology ', ' Production ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Running ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Work ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Ecological Systems ', ' Ecologic Systems ', ' Ecosystem ', ' Visualization ', ' Imagery ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Human Figure ', ' Human body ', ' Genetic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Catalogs ', ' Investigation ', ' cell type ', ' System ', ' Vascular System ', ' Services ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Modeling ', ' Effectiveness ', ' data mining ', ' datamining ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Mathematical Biology ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Resolution ', ' Ontology ', ' Update ', ' Molecular ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' meta data ', ' Metadata ', ' systematic review ', ' vector ', ' data integration ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' visualization tool ', ' Visualization software ', ' computational resources ', ' computing resources ', ' interoperability ', ' usability ', ' data visualization ', ' hackfest ', ' hack day ', ' hackathon ', ' human imaging ', ' ']",OD,INDIANA UNIVERSITY BLOOMINGTON,OT2,2018,330000,IN-09,0.016591101712937442
"A Federated Galaxy for user-friendly large-scale cancer genomics research Project Summary Cancer research is now a data-driven discipline, but only a minority of cancer researchers are data scientists. This severely restricts our ability to effectively study and cure the disease. The far reaching significance of our project is in federating disparate data and computational resources in order to provide a unifying analysis platform for computational cancer research.  We will extend the popular scientific workbench Galaxy (https://galaxyproject.org) so that it can integrate with distributed data and compute resources used and needed by cancer researchers, including those resources in the NCI Cancer Research Data Commons (NCR DC). Our Federated Galaxy system will allow users to seamlessly access NCR DC data across multiple resources. It will support multiple analysis scenarios tuned to skills and computational requirements of individual researchers.  The aims of this project are: Aim 1. Extend Galaxy for working with distributed cancer genomics and phenotypic data. This will enable Galaxy users to access both public and private cancer data regardless of their actual physical location. Best-practice approaches will be used for accessing restricted datasets.  Aim 2. Enhance Galaxy for context-aware, distributed cancer genomics analyses using shared workflow representations. This will enable Galaxy users to run genomics analyses on different clouds, ultimately reducing the time, cost, and data transfer associated with analyses.  Aim 3. Apply Federated Galaxy to precision oncology research. Workflows developed in this aim will leverage the technologies in Aims 1 and 2 to benchmark machine learning algorithms for predicting tumor phenotype and drug response. Interactive reports will summarize benchmarking results and utilize ITCR visualizations for deep dives into results.  Our system will provide a singular access point to distributed cancer datasets and will enable these data to be analyzed within a single portal in a way that satisfies multiple analysis scenarios and utilizes diverse computational resources. Finally, a cloud-centric Galaxy built for the NCR DC will substantially grow the community of users working with the GDC and the NCR DC. This is because Galaxy brings with itself a vibrant world-wide community of users and developers, which numbers tens of thousands of scientists. These individuals will help to tune the GDC and other resources within the NCR DC to the needs of real-life analysis scenarios and will enrich the set of tools accessible to cancer researchers. Project Narrative This project will develop a user-friendly scientific analysis workbench for analyzing cancer genomics data on the NCI Cancer Research Data Commons cloud platform. The workbench will democratize access to cloud-based cancer genomic analyses. It will also aid in precision cancer medicine by benchmarking and identifying the most accurate analytic methods for classifying tumors and predicting drug response.",A Federated Galaxy for user-friendly large-scale cancer genomics research,9603096,U24CA231877,"['Awareness ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Communities ', ' Community Developments ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Sources ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Health ', ' Language ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Maps ', ' Names ', ' Online Systems ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Oregon ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Privatization ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Running ', ' Standardization ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Visualization ', ' Imagery ', ' analytical method ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Galaxy ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Scientist ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Services ', ' empowered ', ' Informatics ', ' skills ', ' Reporting ', ' response ', ' Proteomics ', ' Genomics ', ' Data ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' meta data ', ' Metadata ', ' Output ', ' oncogenomics ', ' cancer genomics ', ' cost ', ' cancer research ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' distributed data ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' next generation ', ' Minority ', ' computational resources ', ' computing resources ', ' user-friendly ', ' web interface ', ' tumor ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' cloud based ', ' precision cancer medicine ', ' precision cancer care ', ' personalized oncology ', ' individualized cancer care ', ' precision oncology ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' Data Scientist ', ' Data Science ', ' Data Analytics ', ' multi-omics ', ' multiple omics ', ' phenotypic data ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' cloud server ', ' cloud platform ', ' genomic data ', ' genomics cloud ', ' Genomic Data Commons ', ' data resource ', ' Predict drug response ', ' drug response prediction ', ' ']",NCI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,U24,2018,823902,OR-03,-0.004869970668974353
"CRCNS: The role of sound statistics for discrimination and coding of sounds ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Humans and other animals can discriminate and recognize sounds despite substantial acoustic variability in real-world sounds. This ability depends partly on the auditory system's ability to detect and utilize high-order statistical regularities that are present in the acoustic environment. Despite numerous advances in signal processing, assistive listening devices and speech recognition technologies lack biologically realistic strategies to dynamically deal with such acoustic variability. Thus, a comprehensive theory for how the central nervous system encodes and utilizes statistical structure in sounds is essential to develop processing strategies for sound recognition, coding and compression, and to assist individuals with hearing loss.     This proposal presents a novel approach towards addressing the question of how the auditory system deals with and exploits statistical regularities for identification and discrimination of sounds in two critical mammalian auditory structures (inferior colliculus, IC; auditory cortex, AC) Aim 1 is to develop a catalogue of natural and man-made sounds and their associated high-order statistics. Cluster analysis and machine learning will be applied to the sound ensembles to identify salient statistical features that can be used to identify and categorize sounds from a computational perspective. Using information theoretic and correlation based methods, Aim 2 tests the hypothesis that statistical sound regularities are encoded in neural response statistics, including firing rate and spike-timing statistics of IC and AC neurons. Aim 3 will determine neurometric response functions and addresses the hypothesis that high-order statistical regularities in sounds can be discriminated based on temporal pattern and firing rate statistics of single neurons in IC and AC. Aim 4 will employ multi-site recording electrode arrays to tests the hypothesis that neural populations in IC and AC use high-order statistics for sound discrimination and that statistical regularities are encoded by regionally distributed differences n the strength and timing of neural responses or neuron-to-neuron correlations.     The study will provide the groundwork for developing a general theory for how the brain encodes and discriminates sounds based on high-order statistical features. A catalogue of neural responses from single cells, neural ensembles, and high-level statistical features that differentiate real world sounds will be developed and deployed as an on-line resource. The role high-order statics play for sound recognition and discrimination will be identified both from a computational and neural coding perspective, including identifying transformations across neural structures, spatial and temporal scales.     The project will foster collaborations between psychology, electrical engineering, and biomedical engineering departments at the UConn. Graduate, undergraduate and a post-doctoral student, including women and minorities, will participate in the research and will receive interdisciplinary training in areas of neurophysiology, computation neuroscience, and engineering. Drs. Read and Escabi regularly host summer interns in their labs and expect that 1-2 undergraduate students will be hosted per year. Graduate students will be enrolled in biomedical, electrical engineering, and psychology programs. Project findings will be integrated in graduate computational neuroscience and biomedical engineering coursework.     The findings could lead to a host of new sound recognition technologies that make use of high-order statistical regularities to recognize and differentiate amongst sounds. Understanding how high-order statistics are represented in the brain could guide the development of optimal algorithms for detecting a target sound (e.g., speech) in variable/noisy conditions. Such sound recognition systems are also applicable in industrial applications: for instance, identifying fault machine systems from machine generated sounds. Knowledge of the statistical distributions in real world sounds and music will be useful for sound compression (e.g., mpeg coding) and to develop efficient sound processing algorithms. Finally, the findings can be incorporated in auditory prosthetics that mimic normal hearing physiology and make use of high-order sound statistics to remove background noise or enhance intelligibility.

"Smartphone phenotype collection for diagnostic screening of mild cognitive impairment Project Summary This project addresses a critical need for early detection of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and other Alzheimer's-related dementias (ADRD). Advances in smartphone hardware, computer vision, and machine learning have enabled the possibility of producing smartphone-based cognitive testing applications able to collect electronic sensor data and transform it into highly informative phenotypes that can serve as early indicators of future disease progression. In this project, we aim to develop a revolutionary new smartphone- based cognitive testing platform, called CTX, that will enable the rapid development and deployment of smartphone-based tests that can capture raw sensor streams in a synchronized fashion, subsample and compress the combined streams, and transmit them to a cloud server for subsequent analysis and modeling. CTX will provide a high-level application development framework that will significantly reduce the time and technical knowledge required to produce a smartphone-based cognitive testing application by providing an application programming interface (API) that enables developers to simply declare what sensor data should be collected and when. The framework will handle all the details of collecting the sensor data, synchronizing it, and transmitting it to a back-end server. The API will also have a variety of other high-level features to facilitate development of cognitive test apps. To demonstrate the feasibility of our vision for CTX, in Aim 1 of this project we will develop the software framework, back-end server software and a prototype smartphone app to exercise and validate many of the platform's features. For Aim 2, we will develop three different tests for this app to test saccade (eye movement) latency, verbal recall, and wrist mobility, each collecting a different type of sensor data (video, audio, and inertial measurement). These tests were selected because their results have been been shown to be predictive of MCI. We will implement phenotype extraction pipelines that employ advanced signal processing, machine learning, and computer vision algorithms to extract the target phenotypes from the sensor data collected for these tests and demonstrate they operate with sufficient accuracy to replicate published experimental designs. Successful completion of this project will eliminate the need for expensive and cumbersome phenotype collection equipment (e.g., eye tracking stations) and create the possibility of generating data from which MCI onset can be predicted. Data collected in Phase II via these and other such tests will enable us to apply our machine learning expertise to produce models able to predict transition to MCI that are both sensitive and specific, transforming any smartphone into an MCI risk assessment tool available for at-home use by millions of people. Project Narrative This NIH Phase I project will address the critical need for early detection of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Alzheimer's-related dementias (ADRD) by developing a revolutionary new smartphone-based cognitive testing platform that will provide individuals with an ongoing status of their cognitive health. Doctors who are given access to the results of these tests will be able to monitor patients more closely and provide more timely diagnoses.

"Improving access to vision correction for health disparity populations with the QuickSee: an accurate, low-cost, easy-to-use objective refractor Summary The principal goal of this proposal is to increase the accuracy and precision of a low-cost autorefraction device called the QuickSee, in order to improve access to refractive eye care for underserved populations. Poor vision due to a lack of eyeglasses is highly prevalent in low-resource settings throughout the world and significantly reduces quality of life, education, and productivity. The existing QuickSee only extracts the lower- order aberration information contained within a wavefront profile of the eye, to roughly estimate an eyeglass prescription. This proposal will further improve the accuracy of the QuickSee device by exploiting both the lower- and higher-order aberrations contained within the complete wavefront. To realize this goal, we will enroll 300 subjects (600 eyes) in Baltimore, MD, and will obtain subjective refraction and visual acuity (VA) measurements and will use machine learning on this large dataset of wavefront profiles to optimize the wavefront-to-refraction algorithm of the QuickSee device. The main output of this project will be a robust and improved-accuracy next-generation QuickSee device that will increase efficiency of and decrease the training requirements of eye care professionals, and potentially dispense refractive correction that provides similar or better VA than correction from an eye care professional. Successful completion of this work will be an important step towards dramatically improving eyeglass accessibility for health disparity populations in the USA and internationally in low-resource settings. Upon completion of this proposal, we will apply for a Phase II award proposing to work with Wilmer Eye Institute research faculty to assess widespread deployment of the next-generation QuickSee with minimally-trained personnel in order to accurately and reliably provide thousands of pairs of low-cost corrective eyeglasses to underserved communities. Project Narrative This project proposal seeks to develop a novel technology that will disruptively increase the accessibility of refractive eye care for health disparity populations in low-resource settings. Specifically, sophisticated algorithms will be developed that improve the accuracy of the QuickSee device so that it can improve the efficiency of and reduce the training barriers for eye care professionals, and potentially provide refractive correction without the need for refinement by a trained eye care professional.

"mIQa: A Highly Scalable and Customizable Platform for Medical Image Quality Assessment Project Summary NIH is increasing its investment in large mutli-center brain MRI studies via projects such as the recently announced BRAIN initiative. The success of these studies depends on the quality of MRIs and the resulting image measurements, regardless of sample size. Even though quality control of MRIs and corresponding measurements could be outsourced, most neuroscience studies rely on in-house procedures that combine automatically generated scores with manually guided checks, such as visual inspection. Implementing these procedures typically requires combining several open-source software systems. For example, the NIH NIAAA and BD2K funded Data Analysis Resource (DAR) of the National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA) uses XNAT to consolidate the structural, diffusion, and functional MRIs acquired across five sites, and has also developed their own custom software package to comply with study requirements that called for a multi-tier, quality control (QC) workflow. However, these custom, one-off tools lack support for multi-site QC workflows as that would require a unified platform, design that supports collaboration and sharing, and strong cohesion between technologies. To improve the effectiveness of QC efforts specific to multi-center neuroimaging studies, we will develop a widely accessible and broadly compatible software platform that supports simplified creation of custom QC workflows in compliance with study requirements, provides core functionality for performing QC of medical images, and automatically generates documentation compliant with the FAIR principle, i.e., making scientific findings findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable.  Specifically, our multi-site open-source software platform for Medical Image Quality Assurance (mIQa) will enable efficient and accurate QC processing by leveraging open-source, state-of-the-art web interface technologies, such as a web-based dataset caching system, machine learning to aid in QC process, and an interactive electronic notebook platform. Users will be able to configure workflows that not only reflect the specific requirements of medical imaging studies but also minimize the time spent on labor-intensive operations, such as visually reviewing scans. Issue tracking technology will enhance communication between geographically-distributed team members, as they can easily share image annotations and receive automating notifications of outstanding QC issues. The system will be easy to deploy as it will be able to interface with various imaging storage backends, such as local file systems and XNAT. While parts of this functionality have been developed elsewhere, mIQa is unique as it provides a unified, standard interface for efficient QC setup, maintenance, and review for projects analyzing multiple, independently managed data sources.  The usefulness of this unique QC system will be demonstrated on increasing the efficiency of the diverse QC team of the multi-center NCANDA study. Narrative The goal of this proposal is to develop multi-site, open-source software for Medical Image Quality Assurance (mIQa) to address the QC needs of geographically diverse teams using small and large medical image-based studies alike. mIQa will enable efficient and accurate QC processing by levering open-source, state-of-the-art machine learning, data management, and web interface technologies. Our effort will minimize the time spent on labor-intensive review and analysis operations by supporting team-oriented reviewing that is guided by highly customizable workflows seamlessly interacting with existing data management systems.",mIQa: A Highly Scalable and Customizable Platform for Medical Image Quality Assessment,9622218,R43MH119022,"['Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Communication ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Sources ', ' Diffusion ', ' Environment ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Investments ', ' Libraries ', ' Logic ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Maintenance ', ' Manuals ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Online Systems ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Peer Review ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Quality Control ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Running ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Custom ', ' Visualization ', ' Imagery ', ' base ', ' quality assurance ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Image Analysis ', ' brain visualization ', ' Brain imaging ', ' Site ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Visual ', ' Measurement ', ' Sample Size ', ' Experiential Learning ', ' Cooperative Learning ', ' Active Learning ', ' Funding ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Notification ', ' Scanning ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' data management ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' cohesion ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Neural Development ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' member ', ' research study ', ' Reporting ', ' Documentation ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' cost ', ' software systems ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' NIAAA ', ' National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' picture archive ', ' image library ', ' image archive ', ' image archival system ', ' web-enabled ', ' 4-dimensional ', ' Four-dimensional ', ' web interface ', ' open source ', ' prototype ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' operation ', ' Data Provenance ', ' BRAIN initiative ', ' application programming interface ', ' BD2K ', ' Big Data to Knowledge ', ' data access ', ' dashboard ', ' Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable ', ' FAIR data ', ' FAIR principles ', ' imaging study ', ' ']",NIMH,"KITWARE, INC.",R43,2018,225001,NY-20,-0.002284913672193544
"UniProt: A centralized protein sequence and function resource Project summary The mission of the Universal Protein Resource (UniProt) is to support biomedical research by providing a freely available, stable, comprehensive, richly and accurately annotated protein sequence knowledgebase (www.uniprot.org). UniProt integrates, interprets and standardizes data from a multitude of sources to achieve the most comprehensive catalog of protein sequences and functional annotation available to date, providing information from hundreds of thousands of publications for tens of millions of proteins from tens of thousands of species. The activities proposed here will increase the utility of UniProt for biomedical research and precision medicine. The expert curated functional information provided by UniProt is widely acknowledged to be of exceptional quality and is continuously updated as new knowledge becomes available. Our first aim will be to continue to curate the scientific literature to ensure UniProt remains up to date. We will also work with the text-mining community to continue to improve curation efficiency. The curated records (0.5 million) are complemented by the (80 million) records for uncharacterized proteins. To ensure their usefulness for the community we will continue to develop our automatic annotation systems to annotate these proteins based on the knowledge of characterized proteins. Our third aim is to connect to and integrate protein data from resources around the world to make UniProt the worldwide global hub of protein information. The integration of clinical variation data as well as metabolomics information with proteins will help to support the multi-omics approaches of precision medicine.

"Development of an Integrated System for Monitoring Home-Cage Behavior in Non-Human Primates 7: Project Summary/Abstract Marmosets are emerging as an important model species for neuroscience research, driven by the development of new technologies such as CRISPR that allow targeted genetic modifications in this species. These developments will allow primate research to take advantage of powerful genetic tools that were previously restricted largely to rodents, including optogenetics, genetic activity reporters, and targeted mutation of endogenous genes implicated in brain function and human disease. Marmosets are well suited to this approach, being small and fast-breeding compared to most primates. They are typically housed in family groups, and exhibit a variety of social behaviors in captivity including complex vocal repertoires. Marmosets thus represent a promising system for studying social behavior and other cognitive functions in a primate model, and they also hold great promise for modeling brain disorders that affect cognitive functions that are difficult to study in other species such as rodents. To take full advantage of these emerging animal models, it is necessary to develop new methods for analyzing their behavior, including naturalistic social interactions that are imperfectly captured by standardized behavioral tasks. We therefore plan to develop a system for automated analysis of marmoset behaviors in the home cage. The system will consist of an integrated array of sensors including video cameras, depth sensors, and collar-mounted wearable microphones. The resulting multimodal data will be synchronized and analyzed using methods from computer vision, speech processing, machine learning, and multimodal data analysis. Specifically we will formulate the tracking analysis as a probabilistic graphical model, which will allow video data to be integrated with audio recordings, and with other modalities that could be explored in future, including inertial motion sensors, physiological recordings and other contextual data. Based on this approach we will develop methods to classify calls, identify individual callers, track the locations and identities of each animal in three dimensions, and classify different actions, including interactions between individuals. We envisage that our system will be useful for a wide range of studies in basic and translational neuroscience, and in particular it will be useful for studying behavioral phenotypes in genetic models of human psychiatric disorders, and for relating behavioral abnormalities to their underlying genetic and neural causes. 8: Project Narrative: We propose to develop an automated system for monitoring the behavior of marmosets in the home cage environment. The proposed system will measure a wide range of naturalistic behaviors including vocal and social interactions, and will be useful for studying animal models of psychiatric disorders such as autism and schizophrenia, in which these behaviors are disrupted. This in turn will allow researchers to relate behavioral abnormalities to their underlying neural and genetic causes, an essential step toward the understanding and eventual treatment of these disorders.",Development of an Integrated System for Monitoring Home-Cage Behavior in Non-Human Primates,9520535,R01MH111916,"['Acoustics ', ' Acoustic ', ' Affect ', ' Animals ', ' Autistic Disorder ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' Infantile Autism ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Autism ', ' Behavior ', ' Animal Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Breeding ', ' Callithrix ', ' Short-Tusked Marmoset ', ' Marmosets ', ' Hapale ', ' Computer Systems ', ' computing system ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Grooming ', ' Head ', ' Housing ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Language Development ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Methods ', ' Genetic Models ', ' Motion ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Noise ', ' Parents ', ' Pathology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Posture ', ' Primates ', ' Primates Mammals ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Rodentia ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Sleep ', ' Social Behavior ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' sociobehavior ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Standardization ', ' Time ', ' Video Recording ', ' video recording system ', ' Videorecording ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Training ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' non-human primate ', ' nonhuman primate ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Genetic ', ' Reporter ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' cognitive function ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Stream ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' 3-D ', ' Location ', ' vibration ', ' vocalization ', ' gaze ', ' limb movement ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' offspring ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' Modality ', ' Modeling ', ' vocal learning ', ' Data ', ' Neurosciences Research ', ' Scheme ', ' wireless ', ' Wireless Technology ', ' Pathologic ', ' Monitor ', ' Modification ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' feeding ', ' behavioral monitoring ', ' Behavior monitoring ', ' social communication ', ' human disease ', ' speech processing ', ' multimodality ', ' translational neuroscience ', ' optogenetics ', ' CRISPR/Cas system ', ' CRISPR ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats ', ' behavior study ', ' behavioral study ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' human model ', ' ']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2018,549425,MA-07,-0.004245150736480614
"Enabling Technology for Safe Robot-assisted Surgical Micromanipulation Project Summary  The goal of this grant is to develop enabling technology and systems that address fundamental limitations in microsurgery with a specific focus on vitreoretinal surgery. Due to the inherent micro-scale and the fragility of the neurosensory retina, vitreoretinal surgeons can be challenged by physiological hand tremor where the tremor amplitude is larger than retinal structures, delicate movements that are below tactile sensation, and multiple cognitive decisions that are required when executing high-risk movements, such as during retinal vein cannulation (RVC). Nevertheless currently vitreoretinal surgery is at the limits of human physiological performance and lacks the adequate technology that could further improve the technical performance. This situation is less than optimal and can significantly benefit from the recent advances in medical robotics, sensor feedback and human machine interface design. Robotic assistance may be ideally suited to address common problems encountered in the performance of the demanding micromanipulations in retinal microsurgery.  We propose a robotic system with enhanced real-time multisensory feedback that assesses multiple points of instrument contact located both inside and outside of the eye. Our comprehensive system will enable the surgeon to manipulate tools based on quantitative feedback that will prevent mechanical injury by implementing safeguards against the application of excessive and previously unmeasurable forces at the eyewall and the tool tip. Our aims are: (1) Develop and demonstrate in vivo position/force hybrid control algorithms for enabling real- time high-fidelity sensorimotor capabilities at the sclerotomy for safe robot-assisted vitreoretinal microsurgery: real-time sensorimotor capabilities at the sclerotomy will be uniquely used to control the robot through a machine learning method that adaptively learns a nonlinear mapping from user behavior to sclera-force/position and predicts unsafe motions; (2) Develop and demonstrate in vivo force-input control algorithms for enabling real- time high-fidelity sensorimotor capabilities at the tool-tip for safe robot-assisted vein cannulation: real-time tool- tip-to-tissue interaction force sensing and non-linear robot control algorithms based on observing the user behavior will be used to control the tool-tip position and force and to prevent entry into subretinal areas during RVC; (3) Demonstrate safe robot-assisted RVC in rabbit model in vivo: real-time, position/force hybrid control algorithms based on dual-point (tool-shaft and tip) information fusion will provide sensorimotor guidance of surgical maneuvers during RVC. Statistically significant results in vivo, in clinically realistic conditions will demonstrate the feasibility of our approach.  This highly innovative system will enable surgeons to perform maneuvers in a tremor free environment with a higher level of precision than previously possible and with the ability to sense forces on a scale that have been previously imperceptible. We envision this development as a logical next step in the integration of man, machine and computer for the performance of unprecedented microsurgical maneuvers. Project Narrative  This R01 grant addresses fundamental limitations in current microsurgical practice, focusing on vitreoretinal surgery (VRS), which is the most technically demanding ophthalmologic surgery. Our goal is to develop a cooperatively controlled robotic system with enhanced sensorimotor capabilities that in conjunction with multifunction force-sensing microsurgical instruments could enable safe robot-assisted retinal surgery.

"Real-time prediction of marijuana use & effects of use on cognition in the natural environment ABSTRACT Some young adult marijuana (MJ) users report adverse effects of MJ use on cognition that impact daily functioning, with negative consequences such as injury and fatality due to driving while under the influence of MJ. Research on the effects of MJ use on cognition, however, has produced mixed findings. MJ effects on cognition may depend on factors such as history and current severity of marijuana use, time since last MJ use (including possible MJ withdrawal effects), and gender. This R21 aims to address limitations of existing research by (1) starting to develop an algorithm to predict MJ use using smartphone data in regular/heavy MJ users based on “routine” or “habitual use”, and (2) examining effects of MJ use on cognition using smartphone- based cognitive testing in the natural environment. Development of an algorithm to predict MJ use would facilitate systematic assessment of MJ effects on cognitive functioning through more efficient scheduling of smartphone cognitive testing among regular/heavy MJ users in relation to daily routines. Cognitive testing by smartphone in the natural environment is an innovative method that has shown validity, and permits sampling of cognitive functioning within and across days in relation to MJ use. This project will enroll non-treatment seeking young adult (ages 18-25) MJ users from the community, representing “low”, “regular”, and “heavy” MJ use, with 50% female at each level of use. Participants will complete a baseline lab assessment, 30-day data collection using smartphone and wearable devices (e.g., wristband), and a debriefing interview. Piloting will optimize the protocol and methods for compliance. Smartphones will collect continuously sensed data (e.g., geolocation) for input to an algorithm to predict MJ use in regular/heavy MJ users. This R21 will identify which types of data, available through smartphone, provide optimal detection of routines in MJ use among regular/heavy users. Smartphone cognitive testing will be administered at various times during acute MJ intoxication and various naturalistically occurring lengths of MJ abstinence to examine effects of MJ use on selected aspects of cognitive functioning in daily life. Development of an algorithm to predict MJ use in regular/heavy MJ users based on smartphone data could, for example, facilitate real-time assessment of MJ effects on cognition through improved sampling of cognition in relation to acute and non-acute effects of MJ use. This R21 will provide the foundation for a research program that aims to examine MJ effects on cognitive functioning in vivo, and could support the development of just-in-time intervention to reduce MJ use. This R21 aligns with NIDA's strategic goal of determining consequences of drug use, and cross-cutting themes of highlighting real-world relevance of research and leveraging mobile health technologies to reduce drug use. Project Narrative This exploratory project will initiate development of an algorithm to predict marijuana use using data from smartphone and ecological momentary assessment, and will examine effects of marijuana use on cognitive functioning in the natural environment using innovative smartphone-based cognitive tests. Developing an algorithm to predict marijuana use has substantial healthcare applications, specifically for timely intervention to reduce marijuana use.

"Advancing Human Health by Lowering Barriers to Electrophysiology in Genetic Model Organisms Project Summary The nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans has proven valuable as a model for many high-impact medical conditions. The strength of C. elegans derives from the extensive homologies between human and nematode genes (60-80%) and the many powerful tools available to manipulate genes in C. elegans, including expressing human genes. Researchers utilizing medical models based on C. elegans have converged on two main quantifiable measures of health and disease: locomotion and feeding; the latter is the focus of this proposal. C. elegans feeds on bacteria ingested through the pharynx, a rhythmic muscular pump in the worm’s throat. Alterations in pharyngeal activity are a sensitive indicator of dysfunction in muscles and neurons, as well as the animal’s overall health and metabolic state. C. elegans neurobiologists have long recognized the utility of the elec- tropharyngeogram (EPG), a non-invasive, whole-body electrical recording analogous to an electrocardiogram (ECG), which provides a quantitative readout of feeding. However, technical barriers associated with whole- animal electrophysiology have limited its adoption to fewer than fifteen laboratories world-wide. NemaMetrix Inc. surmounted these barriers by developing a turn-key, microfluidic system for EPG acquisition and analysis called the the ScreenChip platform. The proposed research and commercialization activities significantly expand the capabilities of the ScreenChip platform in two key respects. First, they enlarge the phenotyping capabilities of the platform by incorporating high-speed video of whole animal and pharyngeal movements. Second they develop a cloud database compatible with Gene Ontology, Open Biomedical Ontologies and Worm Ontology standards, allowing data-mining of combined electrophysiological, imaging and other data modalities. The machine-readable database will be compatible with artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms. It will be accessible to all researchers to enable discovery of relationships between genotypes, phenotypes and treatments using large-scale analysis of multidimensional phenotypic profiles.

"RAVE: A New Open Software Tool for Analysis and Visualization of Electrocorticography Data Project Summary/Abstract  A fast-growing technique in human neuroscience is electrocorticography (ECOG), the only technique that allows the activity of small population of neurons in the human brain to be directly recorded. We use the term ECOG to refer to the entire range of invasive recording techniques (from subdural strips and grids to penetrating electrodes) that share the common attribute of recording neural activity from the human brain with high spatial and temporal resolution. While this ability has resulted in many high-impact advances in understanding fundamental mechanisms of brain function in health and disease, it generates staggering amounts of data as a single patient can be implanted with hundreds of electrodes, each sampled thousands of times a second for hours or even days. The difficulty of exploring these vast datasets is the rate-limiting step in using them to improve human health. We propose to overcome this obstacle by creating an easy-to-use, powerful platform designed from the ground up for the unique properties of ECOG. We dub this software tool RAVE (“R Analysis and Visualization of Electrocorticography data”).  The first goal of Aim 1 is to release RAVE 1.0 to the entire ECOG community by month 6 of the first funding period. This will maximize transformative impact by putting the new tools in the hands of users as quickly as possible, facilitating rapid adoption. The design philosophy of RAVE is driven by three imperatives. The first is to keep users ""close to the data"" so that users may make discoveries about the brain without being misled by artifacts. The second imperative is rigorous statistical methodology. The final imperative is ""play well with others"". As described in Aim 2, our approach will make it easy to seamlessly incorporate new and existing analysis tools written in Matlab, C++, Python or R into RAVE, giving users the best of both worlds: advanced but easy-to-use visualization of results from ECOG experiments, whether they are analyzed with the off-the- shelf tools routines provided with RAVE or novel tools developed by others.

"Clinical resting state fMRI software for surgical planning Abstract Classically, anatomic information provided by MRI has been essential to the neurosurgeon to maximize extent of tumor resection and, as a result, improve survival statistics. That said, it is not routine during resections to make use of similar imaging information that reflect the functional organization of the brain. Task-based fMRI has been employed as a means of pre-operatively localizing function. However, task-based fMRI depends on the patient’s ability to comply with the task paradigm, which frequently is lacking. This problem can be overcome by using the recently developed method of resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) to localize function. Moreover, rsfMRI is highly efficient, as multiple resting state networks (RSNs) associated with multiple cognitive domains can be mapped at the same time. With this in mind, the long-term goal of our research is to improve survival and quality of life after surgical resection of brain tumors by improving the identification/preservation of eloquent cortex. The current barrier that prevents the widespread use of rsfMRI is 1) the high degree of advanced imaging expertise currently necessary to create and interpret the images and 2) the necessary IT infrastructure necessary to support the analyses. To address this shortcoming, we propose to create a turnkey system for functional mapping within the brain that resides on a cloud-computing platform. At the heart of our methodology is a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) algorithm that assigns RSN membership to each locus within the brain using supervised classification of rsfMRI data. Current data demonstrate that MLP-based RSN mapping is more reliable than conventional task-based fMRI and is extremely sensitive to sites identified by cortical stimulation (the standard in intraoperative mapping). Translation of the science and techniques created at Washington University will be accomplished by a deep collaboration with Radiologics, an emerging company with strong expertise in cloud computing for clinical imaging. Towards this end, the overall objective of the proposed project is to create an imaging technology package, named Cirrus, that will integrate automatic MLP-based RSN mapping with cloud-based computing. The Specific Aims of this proposal are to 1) Create Cloud-Based rsfMRI Brain Mapping Capability - Cirrus, 2) Deploy Cloud-Based rsfMRI Capability (Cirrus Platform) to New User Host Institutions, and 3) Optimize the Clinical User Interface (UI) of Cirrus. The expected outcome of this translational strategy will be an integrated imaging/surgical presurgical mapping technology using rsfMRI with clearly defined performance capabilities, well delineated localization outputs, and a clinician friendly user experience that scales to all types of health care settings. Thus, this proposal is innovative because there currently does not exist any comparable system that integrates cutting edge image analysis tools with cloud-based capabilities. This work is significant because it will disseminate technology that fundamentally enhances the surgeon’s understanding of the functional implications of their surgical strategy, thereby enables safer, more tailored approaches to improving outcomes. Project Narrative The proposed research is an academic industry partnership that will make available, to any neurosurgical practice advanced functional MRI methodology to define critical regions in the brain. This development is relevant to public health because it has the potential to improve functional outcomes following surgical removal of brain tumors. Towards this end, we propose to create an imaging technology package that will integrate 1) advanced machine learning techniques using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging, and 2) cloud-based computing, to perform advanced brain mapping. Thus, advanced functional localization can be standardized and acquired at any institution by being uniformly processed in the cloud and sent back to the home institution without the need for costly infrastructure. The integrated package will enable clinicians in any practice environment to efficiently and reliably visualize function on the brain’s anatomy prior to surgery.",Clinical resting state fMRI software for surgical planning,9552903,R44GM125438,"['Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain Mapping ', ' Brain Neoplasms ', ' tumors in the brain ', ' Brain Tumors ', ' Brain Neoplasia ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Environment ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Heart ', ' Industry ', ' Language ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Names ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality Control ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' Radiology ', ' General Radiology ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Science ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Standardization ', ' statistics ', ' Supervision ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Activity ', ' training module ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Work ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Picture Archiving and Communication System ', ' improved ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' Lesion ', ' Failure ', ' Intuition ', ' Individual ', ' neuro-surgeon ', ' Neurosurgeon ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Malignant Glioma ', ' Malignant Neuroglial Tumor ', ' Malignant Neuroglial Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Glial Tumor ', ' Malignant Glial Neoplasm ', ' Surgeon ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' functional status ', ' Excision ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' MRI Scans ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' Image-Guided Surgery ', ' surgical imaging ', ' intraoperative imaging ', ' intra-operative imaging ', ' Institution ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Output ', ' brain tumor resection ', ' cost ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Outcome ', ' Imaging technology ', ' Population ', ' Mind ', ' Stress Tests ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' computational resources ', ' computing resources ', ' user-friendly ', ' Network-based ', ' translational strategy ', ' translation strategy ', ' translational approach ', ' tumor ', ' patient population ', ' industry partnership ', ' industrial partnership ', ' industry partner ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' cloud computer ', ' Cloud Infrastructure ', ' Cloud Computing ', ' Software Algorithm ', ' Algorithmic Tools ', ' Algorithmic Software ', ' cloud based ', ' imaging software ', ' tailored approach ', ' precision approach ', ' individualized approach ', ' Personalized medical approach ', ' personalized approach ', ' improved outcome ', ' clinical imaging ', ' imaging capabilities ', ' healthcare settings ', ' health care settings ', ' preservation ', ' ']",NIGMS,"RADIOLOGICS, INC.",R44,2018,740001,MO-02,-0.028046863375015073
"Novel use of mHealth data to identify states of vulnerability and receptivity to JITAIs Abstract: Smoking cessation decreases morbidity and mortality and is a cornerstone of cancer prevention. The ability to impact current and future vulnerability (e.g., high risk for a lapse) in real-time via engagement in self-regulatory activities (e.g., behavioral substitution, mindful attention) is considered an important pathway to quitting success. However, poor engagement represents a major barrier to maximizing the impact of self- regulatory activities. Hence, enhancing real-time, real-world engagement in evidence-based self-regulatory activities has the potential to improve the effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions. Just-In-Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) delivered via mobile devices have been developed for preventing and treating addictions. JITAIs adapt over time to an individual’s changing status and are optimized to provide appropriate intervention strategies based on real time, real world context. Organizing frameworks on JITAIs emphasize minimizing disruptions to the daily lives and routines of the individual, by tailoring strategies not only to vulnerability, but also to receptivity (i.e., an individual’s ability and willingness to utilize a particular intervention). Although both vulnerability and receptivity are considered latent states that are dynamically and constantly changing based on the constellation and temporal dynamics of emotions, context, and other factors, no attempt has been made to systematically investigate the nature of these states, as well as how knowledge of these states can be used to optimize real-time engagement in self-regulatory activities. To close this gap, the proposed project will apply innovative computational approaches to one of the most extensive and racially/ethnically diverse collection of real time, real world data on health behavior change (smoking cessation). Intensive longitudinal self-reported and sensor data from 5 studies (3 completed and 2 ongoing) of ~1,500 smokers attempting to quit will be analyzed with advanced probabilistic latent variable models and machine learning to investigate how the temporal dynamics and interactions of emotions, self-regulatory capacity (SRC), context, and other factors can be used to detect (Aim 1) states of vulnerability to a lapse and (Aim 2) states of receptivity to engaging in self-regulatory activities. We will also investigate (Aim 3) how knowledge of these states can be used to optimize real-time engagement in self-regulatory activities by conducting a Micro-Randomized Trial (MRT) enrolling 150 smokers attempting to quit. Utilizing a mobile smoking cessation app, the MRT will randomize each individual multiple times per day to either (a) no intervention prompt; (b) a prompt recommending engagement in brief (low effort) strategies; or (c) a prompt recommending a more effortful practice of self-regulation strategies. The proposed research will be the first to yield a comprehensive conceptual, technical, and empirical foundation necessary to develop effective JITAIs based on dynamic models of vulnerability and receptivity. Narrative: The current project proposes to advance the field of theory-driven behavior change interventions by investigating the dynamic role of distinct emotions, Self-Regulatory Capacity (SRC) and context in detecting vulnerability to lapse and receptivity to self-regulatory activities in smokers attempting to quit, as well as ascertaining the utility of these states in triggering real- time self-regulatory recommendations.",Novel use of mHealth data to identify states of vulnerability and receptivity to JITAIs,9576355,U01CA229437,"['Attention ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Boredom ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Emotions ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Aphorisms ', ' Maxim ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Play ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Smoking ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Societies ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' Measures ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Smoker ', ' Depressed mood ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Location ', ' behavior change ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' success ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Cigarette ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Modeling ', ' craving ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' smoking cessation treatment ', ' Effectiveness ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Collection ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' willingness ', ' positive emotion ', ' positive emotional state ', ' coping ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Health behavior change ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' mobile device ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' addictive disorder ', ' addiction ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' mindfulness ', ' Randomization trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' mobile health ', ' m-Health ', ' mHealth ', ' field theory ', ' Learning Skill ', ' Formulation ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2018,672594,MI-12,0.00876817452773706
"Controlling Locomotion over Continuously Varying Activities for Agile Powered Prosthetic Legs PROJECT ABSTRACT Above-knee amputees often struggle to perform the varying activities of daily life with conventional prostheses. Emerging powered knee-ankle prostheses have motors that can restore normative biomechanics, but these devices are limited to a small set of pre-defined activities that must be tuned to the user by technical experts over several hours. The overall goal of this project is to model and control human locomotion over continuously varying tasks for the design of agile, powered prostheses that require little to no tuning. The universal use of different task-specific controllers in current powered legs is a direct consequence of the prevailing paradigm for viewing human locomotion as a discrete set of activities. There is a fundamental gap in knowledge about how to analyze, model, and control continuously varying locomotion, which greatly limits the adaptability and agility of powered prostheses. The central hypothesis of this project is that continuously varying activities can be represented by a single mathematical model based on measureable physical quantities called task variables. The proposed project will be scientifically significant to understanding how humans continuously adapt to varying activities and environments, technologically significant to the design of agile, user-synchronized powered prosthetic legs, and clinically significant to the adoption of powered knee-ankle prostheses for improved community ambulation. The proposed model of human locomotion will enable new prosthetic strategies for controlling and adapting to the environment, which aligns with the missions of the NICHD/NCMRR Devices and Technology Development program area and the NIBIB Mathematical Modeling, Simulation, and Analysis program. The innovation of this work is encompassed in 1) a continuous paradigm for variable locomotor activities that challenges the existing discrete paradigm, 2) a unified task control methodology that drastically improves the agility of powered prosthetic legs, and 3) a partially automated tuning process that significantly reduces the time and technical expertise required to configure powered knee- ankle prostheses. This continuous task paradigm will provide new methods and models for studying human locomotion across tasks and task transitions. This innovation will address a key roadblock in control technology that currently restricts powered legs to a small set of activities that do not generalize well across users. The adaptability of the proposed control paradigm across users and activities will transform the prosthetics field with a new generation of “plug-and-play” powered legs for community ambulation. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because the clinical application of variable-activity powered prosthetic legs can significantly improve community mobility and therefore quality of life for nearly a million American amputees. Recently developed powered knee-ankle prostheses are limited to a small set of pre- defined activities that require several hours of expert tuning for each user. This project will model and control human locomotion over continuously varying tasks for the design of agile, powered prostheses that require little to no tuning, which aligns with the missions of the Devices and Technology Development program area of the NICHD National Center for Medical Rehabilitation Research and the Mathematical Modeling, Simulation, and Analysis program of the NIBIB.",Controlling Locomotion over Continuously Varying Activities for Agile Powered Prosthetic Legs,9596236,R01HD094772,"['Adoption ', ' Amputees ', ' Ankle ', ' Tarsus ', ' Tarsal Bone ', ' Regio tarsalis ', ' Biomechanics ', ' biomechanical ', ' Communities ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Environment ', ' Gait ', ' Goals ', ' Hand ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Joints ', ' Knee ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lower Extremity ', ' Membrum inferius ', ' Lower Limb ', ' Locomotion ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mission ', ' Study models ', ' Motion ', ' Motor Activity ', ' Locomotor Activity ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Orthotic Devices ', ' Orthosis ', ' Play ', ' Program Development ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Running ', ' Spinal cord injury ', ' Traumatic Myelopathy ', ' Spinal cord injuries ', ' Spinal cord injured ', ' Spinal Trauma ', ' Spinal Cord Trauma ', ' Stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Technical Expertise ', ' technical skills ', ' Walking ', ' Prosthetics ', ' Prosthetic device ', ' Prosthesis ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Human Figure ', ' Human body ', ' Electrical Engineering ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Mechanics ', ' mechanical ', ' Hour ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' System ', ' Artificial Leg ', ' prosthetic leg ', ' Leg Prosthesis ', ' Gray unit of radiation dose ', ' Gray ', ' Medical center ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' human data ', ' exoskeleton ', ' exoskeletal ', ' success ', ' technology development ', ' tech development ', ' kinematics ', ' kinematic model ', ' Speed ', ' Devices ', ' orthotics ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' mathematical model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematic model ', ' Math Models ', ' Leg ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Device or Instrument Development ', ' instrument development ', ' device development ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Measurable ', ' Motor ', ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' NICHD ', ' Rehabilitation Research ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' NIBIB ', ' National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinically significant ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' clinical applicability ', ' clinical application ', ' time measurement ', ' temporal resolution ', ' temporal measurement ', ' prosthetic control ', ' prosthesis control ', ' powered prosthesis ', ' Degree program ', ' Gait speed ', ' robotic control ', ' robot control ', ' human model ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS DALLAS,R01,2018,474602,TX-32,0.021340182778557343
"Strengthening Families Program Online Web Version for Teens ABSTRACT  This SBIR Phase I project uses formative evaluation strategies to develop, test, refine, and evaluate an alpha prototype of the 10-session, evidence-based Strengthening Families Program 7-17 and SFP Home-Use DVD as a web-assisted platform. The Specific Aim of the new “SFP Online!” program is to increase family accessibility and engagement by transitioning from costly group-based, facilitator-led, parenting and family skills training to low cost web-delivery. SFP draws heavily on theories that integrate family dynamics (monitoring, bonding, and communication), parenting skills, youth drug etiology (risk and protective factors), and social learning. Substantial empirical evidence from 14 RCTs with diverse families and locations shows that SFP works with large program effect sizes to reduce behavioral health risks and substance abuse. Phase I will determine whether the adapted online version can reproduce outcomes of the facilitator-led family group version with minimal loss of fidelity, efficacy, and vitality. Five integrated formative evaluation strategies involving 380 participants including ten focus groups with potential end users (100 parents and 100 youth) from SFP providers nationwide will explore adaptations, usability, feasibility and barriers to use. Consumer preference surveys tapping both recent SFP DVD users and agency service providers will explore factors that may mitigate or enhance delivery of SFP Online. This approach based on input from both parents and youth and providers will ensure that SFP Online is culturally and developmentally appropriate. We will also rely on key informant interviews with 50 family service providers and community stakeholders to address barriers to implementation and the eventual integration of SFP Online into existing prevention and treatment strategies. We will include interviews with prevention scientists and e-learning experts to review the architectural plan and ensure fidelity to current prevention and technology initiatives. These consumer surveys will inform a product specification plan supporting a “wireframe technology” to make SFP Online a viable web-assisted program. To create the alpha prototype in Phase I SFP LLC will collaborate with 3C Institute, a leading software development company with extensive expertise building interactive multimedia technology for behavioral health interventions. 3C Institute will employ its proprietary Dynamic e-Learning Platform (DeLP), a customizable technology that integrates the latest in artificial intelligence and machine learning. LARS Research Institute, a leading behavioral technology transfer company will assist in the evaluation of the program’s adherence to the standards of evidence. We will also draw on extensive community support based on 30 years of administering SFP products to family service agencies nationwide and other CBOs that emphasize parent training, and drug and child maltreatment prevention. The proposed formative evaluation strategies and collaboration with ten national prevention and e-learning experts should ensure timely and successful completion of the Phase I research activities and produce an effortless transition to the Phase II build-and-test stage. Project Narrative – SFP Online! This Phase I SBIR study seeks to adapt the Strengthening Families Program, an evidence-based facilitator-led family skills training and youth drug prevention program with family classes and entertaining video clips, to a web-based platform. Providing parenting training and drug prevention via the web offers tremendous cost savings and provides an efficient conduit for mass dissemination. The proposal utilizes five formative evaluation strategies to examine the steps required for technological adaptation and which will retain program and implementation fidelity.",Strengthening Families

"Towards a comprehensive multiscale 3D human interactome network PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Almost all proteins function through interacting with other proteins. On average, a protein interacts with ~5 other protein partners in the current human interactome. Therefore, it is of great importance to accurately determine the interface of each interaction, in order to understand how each protein works with different partners to carry out different functions. In our previous Nature Biotechnology study, we implemented a proteome-scale homology modeling approach to generate the first 3D human structural interactome: the interface for each interaction in this network was determined at atomic resolution through co-crystal structures and homology models. Using our 3D interactome, we found that, among >1,800 known disease genes associated with two or more clinically distinctly disorders, pairs of mutations on the same gene but in different interfaces with different partners are significantly more likely to cause distinct diseases. However, only 4,150 human protein interactions have co-crystal structures and 2,921 have high-quality homology models. ~50,000 interactions (87% of the current human interactome) are not amenable to current structural modeling methods. Here, we propose to develop a big-data-driven machine-learning approach integrating biophysiochemical, evolutionary, structural, and population genetic features to identify interaction- specific interfaces for the whole human interactome. Because several key features are unavailable for many proteins and interactions, we propose an innovative approach to use an ensemble of random forest classifiers, named Ensemble Protein Interface Classifier (EPIC), to address this large-scale non-random missing data problem (Aim 1). The high throughput of our massively parallel Clone-seq and INtegrated PrOtein INteractome perTurbation screening (InPOINT) pipeline! uniquely enables us to perform real-time experimental parameter optimization (in Years 2-4 we will clone ~1,500 mutations and examine their impact on ~2,500 interactions every year to iteratively evaluate and refine EPIC; Aim 2). Finally, we will construct a comprehensive multiscale 3D interactome for all known human protein-protein interactions: we will collect/generate atomic- resolution structural models for interactions whenever possible (co-crystal structures and homology models); we will accurately determine interaction-specific interface residues and domains for the whole human interactome. We will deploy an interactive web portal to disseminate our results and allow functional genomic inference in the context of our structural interactome (Aim 3). Our comprehensive multiscale 3D human interactome and the accompanying web portal will greatly reduce the barrier-to-entry for performing systematic structural analysis on a large number of proteins and their interactions, and open the flood gates for such analyses in genomic studies. NARRATIVE Almost all proteins function through interacting with other proteins and the structural details of these interaction interfaces are key in understanding protein function. However, the interfaces for vast majority of human protein interactions are currently unknown. Here, we propose to establish an innovative ensemble classifier approach and implement an unprecedented large-scale computational-experimental iterative learning scheme to predict interfaces for the whole human interactome, in anticipation that our predicted interfaces will help dissect functional sites of disease mutations and be useful for rational drug design to target these sites.",Towards a comprehensive multiscale 3D human interactome network,9520213,R01GM124559,"['Biotechnology ', ' Biotech ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Crystallization ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Drug Design ', ' Evolution ', ' Floods ', ' Flooding ', ' Genes ', ' Population Genetics ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Study models ', ' Structural Models ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Names ', ' Proteins ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' forest ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Individual ', ' Letters ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Missense Mutation ', ' Structure ', ' Graph ', ' Proteome ', ' Modeling ', ' protein protein interaction ', ' functional genomics ', ' Genomics ', ' Binding ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Homology Modeling ', ' Resolution ', ' Scheme ', ' Molecular ', ' Docking ', ' protein function ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' biological research ', ' user-friendly ', ' web-accessible ', ' screening ', ' BigData ', ' Big Data ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' internet portal ', ' web portal ', ' human interactome ', ' ']",NIGMS,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,384167,NY-23,-0.04177698725547273
"SenseWhy: Overeating in Obesity Through the Lens of Passive Sensing PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Medical professionals have recently put to rest the idea that there is an ideal weight loss diet for everyone. One cause for obesity is overeating, but we do not know what patterns and behaviors contribute to this problematic habit. Defining problematic eating behaviors that lead to energy imbalance is essential for treating obesity. Studies typically focus on a single putative causal mechanism of overeating such as stress or craving, not addressing the multiple features that co-occur with overeating. Hence, the factors that predict overeating episodes remain unknown, as do which of them contribute to an individual's consistency and variability of overeating. Given recent advancements in passive sensing, we now have the potential to detect problematic eating using seamlessly captured physiological features such as number of feeding gestures and swallows, and heart rate variability. Collecting detectable and predictable features that identify overeating will hone in on the patterns that interventionists may optimally target to help populations with obesity understand their eating habits and ultimately improve their ability to self-regulate their eating behaviors. Location-scale models will map the factors that most contribute to habit formation within subjects, providing interventionists with essential targets to guide behavior. The first aim is to collect sensor-based and ecological momentary assessment data (to assess factors not yet detectable through sensing) from adults with obesity and apply machine learning algorithms to identify a subset of features that detect overeating, as validated against ground truth of videotaped eating episodes and 24 hour dietary recall. Participants will wear a passive sensing sensor suite and respond to random and event-triggered prompts regarding each eating episode. Then, machine learning will determine the optimal feature subset that detect overeating episodes using Gradient Boosting Machines. In the second aim, hierarchical clustering techniques will cluster overeating episodes into theoretically meaningful and clinically known problematic behaviors related to overeating. The final aim is to build statistical models that explain the effect of detectable and clinically-known problematic features on new habit formation. These models will lay a foundation for optimization studies to discover evidence-based decision rules that can guide timely interventions to treat obesity by preventing overeating, and maintaining healthy eating behaviors. PROJECT NARRATIVE Obesity affects more than a third of American adults. Weight loss regimens rely on self-monitoring, but many people struggle to exercise this skill due to difficulty of execution and small perceived short-term benefit. Wearable passive sensors allow us to learn an individual's problematic eating behaviors more easily. Analyzing sensor data then enables us to identify the essential factors that describe and even predict overeating, and ultimately provide personalized care that supports maintenance of healthy eating behaviors.",SenseWhy: Overeating in Obesity Through the Lens of Passive Sensing,9453227,K25DK113242,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH use ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Algorithms ', ' Appetitive Behavior ', ' Searching Behavior ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavioral Medicine ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Energy Intake ', ' caloric dietary content ', ' Caloric Intake ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Computers ', ' Cues ', ' Deglutition ', ' Swallowing ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Exercise ', ' Family ', ' Feeding behaviors ', ' nutrient intake activity ', ' feeding-related behaviors ', ' Ingestive Behavior ', ' Foundations ', ' Gestures ', ' Goals ', ' Habits ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Hyperphagia ', ' polyphagia ', ' Overeating ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Maintenance ', ' Maps ', ' Mastication ', ' chews ', ' chewed ', ' Chewing ', ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Neck ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Phenotype ', ' Public Health ', ' Records ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Rest ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Stress ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Videotape ', ' Body Weight decreased ', ' wt-loss ', ' body weight loss ', ' Weight Reduction ', ' Weight Loss ', ' Wrist ', ' Friends ', ' Measures ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Diet Habits ', ' eating habit ', ' Dietary Habits ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Medical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' participant recruitment ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Dietitian ', ' Scientist ', ' Hour ', ' Calories ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' computer science ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' social ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' craving ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Intake ', ' Monitor ', ' substance abuse therapy ', ' substance abuse treatment ', ' obesity treatment ', ' feeding ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Food Access ', ' Population ', ' Eating Behavior ', ' hedonic ', ' lenses ', ' lens ', ' evidence base ', ' heart rate variability ', ' emotional eater ', ' emotional eating ', ' Regimen ', ' algorithmic methods ', ' algorithmic methodologies ', ' personalized patient care ', ' individualized patient care ', ' individualized care ', ' Precision care ', ' personalized care ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' Data Analytics ', ' wearable technology ', ' Healthy Eating ', ' wearable sensor ', ' wearable device ', ' adults with obesity ', ' adult adiposity ', ' adult obesity ', ' ']",NIDDK,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,K25,2018,166481,IL-07,-0.005777648266726285
"Human and Machine Learning for Customized Control of Assistive Robots PROJECT SUMMARY This application will result in a technological platform that re-empowers persons with severe paralysis, by allowing them to independently control a wide spectrum of robotic actions. Severe paralysis is devastating, and chronic—and reliance on caregivers is persistent. Assistive machines such as wheelchairs and robotic arms offer a groundbreaking path to independence: where control over their environment and interactions is returned to the person.  However, to operate complex machines like robotic arms and hands typically poses a difﬁcult learning challenge and requires complex control signals—and the commercial control interfaces accessible to persons with severe paralysis (e.g. sip-and-puff, switch-based head arrays) are not adequate. As a result, assistive robotic arms remain largely inaccessible to those with severe paralysis—arguably the population who would beneﬁt from them most.  The purpose of the proposed study is to provide people with tetraplegia with the means to control robotic arms with their available body mobility, while concurrently promoting the exercise of available body motions and the maintenance of physical health. Control interfaces that generate a unique map from a user's body motions to control signals for a machine offer a customized interaction, however these interfaces have only been used to issue low-dimensional (2-D) control signals whereas more complex machines require higher-dimensional (e.g. 6-D) signals. We propose an approach that leverages robotics autonomy and machine learning in order to aid the end-user in learning how to issue effective higher-dimensional control signals through body motions. Speciﬁcally, initially the human issues a lower- dimensional control signal and robotics autonomy is used to bridge the gap by taking over whatever is not covered by the human's control signal. Help from the robotics autonomy is then progressively scaled back, automatically, to cover fewer and fewer control dimensions as the user becomes more skilled.  The ﬁrst piece to our approach deals with how to extract control signals from the human, using the body-machine interface. The development and optimization of decoding procedures for controlling a robotic arm using residual body motions will be addressed under Speciﬁc Aim 1. The second piece to our approach deals with how to interpret control signals from a human within a paradigm that shares control between the human and robotics autonomy. To identify which shared-control formulations most effectively utilize the human's control signals will be the topic of Speciﬁc Aim 2. The ﬁnal piece to our approach deals with how to adapt the shared-control paradigm so that more control is transferred to the human over time. This adaptation is necessary for the human's learning process, since the goal in the end is for the human to be able to fully control the robotic arm him/herself, and will be assessed under Speciﬁc Aim 3.  At the completion of this project, tetraplegic end-users will be able to operate a robotic arm using their residual body motions, through an interface that both promotes the use of residual body motions (and thus also recovery of motor skill) and adapts with the human as their abilities change over time. By leveraging adaptive robotics autonomy, our application moreover provides a safe mechanism to facilitate learning how to operate the robotic platform. Frequently the more severe a person's motor impairment, the less able they are to operate the very assistive machines, like powered wheelchairs and robotic arms, which might enhance their quality of life. The purpose of the proposed study is to provide people with tetraplegia with the means, through non-invasive technologies, to control robotic arms with their available body mobility, while concurrently promoting the exercise of available body motions and the maintenance of physical health. We propose and study an approach that leverages robot machine learning and autonomy in order to facilitate human motor learning of how to operate a robotic arm using a customized interface, in order to make powered assisted manipulation more accessible to people with severe paralysis. 1",Human and Machine Learning for Customized Control of Assistive Robots,9448794,R01EB024058,"['Activities of Daily Living ', ' functional capacity ', ' functional ability ', ' daily living functionality ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Cerebral Palsy ', ' Computers ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Environment ', ' Exercise ', ' Limb structure ', ' Non-Trunk ', ' Limbs ', ' Extremities ', ' Freedom ', ' Liberty ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Hand ', ' Head ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Learning ', ' Maintenance ', ' Maps ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Motion ', ' Motivation ', ' Motor Skills ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Multiple Sclerosis ', ' insular sclerosis ', ' Disseminated Sclerosis ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' Posture ', ' Quadriplegia ', ' tetraplegic ', ' Tetraplegia ', ' Quadriplegic ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Robotics ', ' Self-Help Devices ', ' assistive device ', ' Assistive Technology ', ' Shoulder ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Wheelchairs ', ' mobile assistive system ', ' mobile assistive device ', ' mobile assistance system ', ' mobile assistance device ', ' Wheel Chairs ', ' Work ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' Electric wheelchair ', ' Powered wheelchair ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Left ', ' Chronic ', ' Residual ', ' Residual state ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Fostering ', ' Robot ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Side ', ' System ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' 3-D ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' Paralysed ', ' paralytic ', ' paralysis ', ' Plegia ', ' Palsy ', ' Performance ', ' empowerment ', ' Devices ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' feeding ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' brain machine interface ', ' spinal cord injury survivor ', ' SCI survivor ', ' Spinal cord injured survivor ', ' Population ', ' 2-dimensional ', ' two-dimensional ', ' locomotor learning ', ' motor learning ', ' n-dimensional ', ' movement limitation ', ' movement impairment ', ' motor impairment ', ' arm ', ' body-machine interface ', ' motor recovery ', ' Formulation ', ' robotic control ', ' robot control ', ' high dimensionality ', ' ']",NIBIB,REHABILITATION INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO D/B/A SHIRLEY RYAN ABILITYLAB,R01,2018,331851,IL-07,-0.010134339453430998

"QuBBD: Geometric Time-Frequency Methods for Multi-modal Physiological Monitoring Modern health monitoring devices at hospitals and wearable sensors in households generate a large amount of time series data at high rate, capturing the physiological status of patients in a real-lime fashion. The premise is that these technology advances enable a data-driven healthcare system that starts making fast, accurate, objective and inexpensive decisions based upon data, in addition to an individual physician's experience and preference. However, there is a significant gap in the mathematical theory and computational tools to promptly extract actionable information from multi-modal non-stationary time series data in a robust and tractable manner, which has become a serious roadblock to further utilize bigger data for better healthcare monitoring. The goal of this research program is to develop a mathematical framework for extracting time-frequency and geometric representations of multi-modal physiological data, in an online and robust manner, and use them to design machine learning algorithms to improve real-lime health monitoring. Specifically, we hypothesize that the development of time-series and geometric methods for large streaming multi-modal monitoring data will lead to more accurate diagnosis on various physiological monitoring applications, including detection and prediction of rare events such as seizure and arrhythmia, classification of sleep stages for newborns and children, and real-time artifact removal of physiological data. To achieve our goal, we plan to develop novel theoretical and computational tools for analyzing non-stationary multi-modal time series data with noise, corruption and missing data as well as real-time algorithms for filtering and event detection from such data. The tools and algorithms will be applied on clinical tasks at the Nationwide Children's Hospital. In addition, the real-time workflow will be implemented on Hadoop clusters with a mission of public sharing of both data and software. The development from the interdisciplinary team composed of mathematicians, biomedical informaticians as well as the hospital will not only transform the frontiers of mathematics knowledge, but also significantly impact clinical applications, data science education, and the development of the $11 O billion emerging market of wireless health. The goal of this project is to develop a series of novel computational theory and software to extract physiological information from the large multi-modal data streams generated by modern health monitoring devices.

"Evaluating and Improving Assistive Robotic Devices Continuously and in Real-time Project Summary Lower limb assistive robotic devices, such as active prosthesis, orthoses, and exoskeletons have the potential to restore function for the millions of Americans who experience mobility challenges due to injury and disability. Since individuals with mobility challenges have an increased energetic cost of transport, the benefit of such assistive devices is commonly assessed via the reduction in the metabolic work rate of the individual who is using the device. Currently, metabolic work rate can only be obtained in a laboratory environment, using breath-by-breath measurements of respiratory gas analysis. To obtain a single steady state data point of metabolic work rate, multiple minutes of data must be collected, since the signals are noisy, sparsely sampled, and dynamically delayed. In addition, the user has to wear a mask and bulky equipment, further restricting the applicability of the method on a larger scale. We propose an improved way to obtain such estimates of metabolic work rate in real-time. Aim 1 will determine salient signal features and characterize the dynamics of sensing metabolic work rate from a variety of physiological sensor signals. Aim 2 will use advanced sensor fusion and machine learning techniques to accurately predict instantaneous energy cost in real-time from multiple physiological signals without relying on a metabolic mask. Aim 3 will use the obtained real-time estimates to optimize push-off timing for an active robotic prosthesis. The resulting methods will enable an automated and continuous evaluation of assistive robotic devices that can be realized outside the laboratory and with simple wearable sensors. This automated evaluation will enable devices, such as active prostheses, orthoses, or exoskeletons, that can self-monitor their performance, optimize their own behavior, and continuously adapt to changing circumstances. This will open up a radically new way of human-robot- interaction for assistive devices. It will greatly increase their clinical viability and enable novel advanced controllers and algorithms that can improve device performance on a subject specific basis. Project Narrative A common way of evaluating assistive robotic devices, such as active prostheses or exoskeletons, is by measuring the reduction in effort that they bring to an individual walking in them. The proposed project will develop ways to perform this evaluation automatically and in real-time by the device itself, which will be used in the future to develop prostheses and exoskeletons that automatically adapt themselves to their users.

"The role of ENDS use in changing rates of escalation and quitting of cigarette smoking in those under age 35 years in US population Abstract Recently, there has been extensive use of Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS) by young people in the United States (US). These products have the potential to significantly reduce the proportion of young adults who are addicted to cigarette smoking, either by influencing the proportion who escalate to daily cigarette smoking or by increasing the proportion who quit under the age of 35 years. Previous research has demonstrated that there are two groups of escalators to daily cigarette smoking: 1) early escalators who are daily smokers before age 20 years, and 2) later escalators (become daily smokers at 21+ years). This proposal will explore the long-term role of ENDS in changing the escalation and quitting of cigarette smoking using the first four waves of the national Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) longitudinal study. The study used a four stage stratified area probability design and has enrolled ~26,000 people under the age of 35 years, half of whom were female. The public use data for the first two waves are available and include longitudinal weighting variables. Wave 3 is expected to be publicly available in Spring 2018, and Wave 4 one is expected year later. The weighted response for Wave 2 was 87% for 12-17 year olds, and 83% for adults. With these PATH data, we will explore two scientific premises: 1) that widespread promotion of ENDS has resulted in a new generation of nicotine users who rely on ENDS usage and who did not escalate to daily cigarette smokers when becoming adults; and 2) that the diffusion of ENDS among young tobacco users will result in lower nicotine dependence that, in turn, will be associated with higher rates of successful discontinuance of cigarette smoking before age 35 years. A significant methodological weakness in such complex longitudinal analyses is related to the consideration of a large number of time-varying confounding variables that are prognostic for changes in tobacco use behaviors and are also associated with the outcome of interest. Some epidemiological methods allow the achievement of covariate balance between different exposure groups. With these methods, ongoing differences in outcomes of interest are directly attributable to ENDS usage, for example. In this context, we leverage Propensity Score Matching (PSM), and Marginal Structural Models (MSMs) to adjust for time-varying confounding. We will also explore Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE) techniques to optimize the performance of PSM. We will conduct separate analyses for early escalators, late escalators, and quitters before age 35 years. This proposal will answer an urgent public health question in regards to the long-term potential benefits associated with ENDS usage, while also providing an example to the tobacco research field of state-of-art epidemiological methods for complex longitudinal analyses. Project Narrative Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS) appear to be changing the product pattern through which young people become nicotine dependent. Using the first four waves from the national Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study, we will investigate whether ENDS use changes the pattern of escalation and early quitting among those less than 35 years in the United States.",The role of ENDS use in changing rates of escalation and quitting of cigarette smoking in those under age 35 years in US population,9647728,R01CA234539,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Behavior ', ' Confounding Factors (Epidemiology) ', ' Epidemiologic Confounding Factor ', ' Confounding Variables ', ' Data Collection ', ' Diffusion ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Epidemiologic Methods ', ' Methods Epidemiology ', ' Epidemiological Techniques ', ' Epidemiological Methods ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Escalator ', ' Family ', ' Female ', ' Health ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Structural Models ', ' Nicotine ', ' Nicotine Dependence ', ' nicotine dependent ', ' nicotine addiction ', ' Perception ', ' Probability ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Smoking ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' United States ', ' Weight ', ' Estimation Techniques ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Area ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' prognostic ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' cigarette use ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' Exposure to ', ' Smoker ', ' Cigarette Smoker ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Tobacco Use Cessation ', ' Tobacco Cessation ', ' Cigarette ', ' peer ', ' Categories ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Smoking Behavior ', ' Smoking Status ', ' Monitor ', ' tobacco marketing ', ' tobacco ads ', ' tobacco advertising ', ' comparison group ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' twelve years of age ', ' twelve year old ', ' age 12 years ', ' 12 years of age ', ' 12 year old ', ' seventeen years of age ', ' seventeen year old ', ' age 17 years ', ' 17 years of age ', ' 17 year old ', ' eighteen years of age ', ' eighteen year old ', ' age 18 years ', ' 18 years of age ', ' 18 year old ', ' twenty years of age ', ' twenty year old ', ' age 20 years ', ' 20 years of age ', ' 20 year old ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' ecigarette ', ' ecig ', ' e-cigarette ', ' e-cig ', ' Electronic cigarette ', ' health data ', ' Smoke-free home ', ' rate of change ', ' electronic nicotine delivery device ', ' Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health ', ' nicotine consumption ', ' nicotine use ', ' tobacco user ', ' nicotine user ', ' ']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2018,446068,CA-52,0.01742979610307594
"Novel Use of Emergent Technologies to Improve Efficiency of Animal Model Research PROJECT SUMMARY This Phase II project aims to continue development of a commercial quality, innovative cloud hosted information management system, called Climb 2.0™ that will increase laboratory efficiency and provide improved capabilities for research laboratories. Climb is designed to offer integrated laboratory process management modules that include mobile communications tools data monitoring and alert systems, and integrated access to Microsoft Azure Cloud™ Machine Learning and Stream Analytics services. Initially, Climb 2.0 will target animal model research laboratories; however, the core of the platform is designed to be adaptable to nearly any research type or related industry. Current research information management systems are primarily designed as record-keeping tools with little or no direct focus on laboratory efficiency or in enhancing value of the research data. They also do not leverage emergent mobile device technologies, social media frameworks, and data analysis and storage capabilities of cloud computing. Many laboratories still use paper as their primary recording system. Paper data logging is then followed by secondary data entry into a laboratory database. These systems are error prone, time consuming and lead to laboratory databases with significant time lags between data acquisition and data entry. Moreover, they do not recognized cumulative data relationships, which may identify important trends, and researchers often miss windows of opportunity to take action on time-sensitive events. In Phase I, RockStep Solutions demonstrated feasibility of an innovative Cloud Information Management Bundle system, Climb, which will increase efficiency and improve capabilities in animal model data management. During Phase I, a beta version of Climb was successfully developed and tested against strict performance metrics as a proof of concept. We successfully built a prototype with working interfaces that integrates real-time communication technologies with media capabilities of mobile devices. Phase II proposes four specific Aims: 1) Develop the technology infrastructure to support the secure and scalable Software as a Service (SaaS) deployment of Climb for enterprise commercial release; 2) Develop and extend the Phase-I prototype Data Monitoring and Messaging System (DMMS) into a platform ready for production use; 3) Extend Climb’s DMMS adding a Stream Analytics engine to support Internet of Things (IoT) devices and streaming media; 4) Deploy a beta release of Climb at partner research labs, test and refine the product for final commercialization. To ensure Climb is developed with functionality and tools relevant to research organizations, RockStep Solutions has established collaborations with key beta sites to test all of the major functionality developed in this proposal. IMPACT: By leveraging emergent technologies and cloud computing, Climb offers several advantages: 1) enables real-time communications using familiar tools among members of research groups; 2) reduces the risk of experimental setbacks, and 3) enables complex experiments to be conducted efficiently. PROJECT NARRATIVE PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The NIH Invests approximately $12 billion each year in animal model research that is central to both understanding basic biological processes and for developing applications directly related to improving human health. More cost-effective husbandry and colony management techniques, equipment, and new approaches to improve laboratory animal welfare and assure efficient and appropriate research use (e.g., through cost savings and reduced animal burden) are high priorities for NIH. RockStep Solutions proposes to meet this need by integrating existing and emergent software and communication technologies to create a novel solution, Climb 2.0, for research animal data management. Climb 2.0 extracts immediate value of data in animal research laboratories and extends the database into a multimedia communication network, thus enabling science that would be impractical to conduct with traditional methods.",Novel Use of Emergent Technologies to Improve Efficiency of Animal Model Research,9741597,R44GM112206,"['Algorithms ', ' Animal Experimentation ', ' Animal Research ', ' Animal Experimental Use ', ' Animal Welfare ', ' Animals ', ' Laboratory Animals ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Clinical Laboratory Information Systems ', ' Laboratory Information Systems ', ' Communication ', ' Communications Media ', ' Forms of Communication ', ' Computers ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Information Management ', ' Equipment ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Industry ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' Inventory ', ' Investments ', ' Laboratories ', ' Laboratory Research ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Management Information Systems ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Motion ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Paper ', ' Production ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Cost Savings ', ' Data Security ', ' information security ', ' Data awareness ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Phase ', ' Ensure ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' data storage ', ' data retrieval ', ' Data Storage and Retrieval ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Multimedia ', ' Multimedium ', ' programs ', ' Notification ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Stream ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Services ', ' data management ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' laptop ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' Transact ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Devices ', ' time interval ', ' computerized data processing ', ' data processing ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' The Jackson Laboratory ', ' Communication Tools ', ' Emergent Technologies ', ' Emerging Technologies ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cost ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Consumption ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' analytical tool ', ' data acquisition ', ' graphic user interface ', ' Graphical interface ', ' graphical user interface ', ' mobile device ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' encryption ', ' usability ', ' prototype ', ' commercialization ', ' public health relevance ', ' good laboratory practice ', ' Secure ', ' cloud computer ', ' Cloud Infrastructure ', ' Cloud Computing ', ' cloud based ', ' service-based learning ', ' service learning ', ' social media ', ' Data Analytics ', ' software as a service ', ' Internet of Things ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' ']",NIGMS,"ROCKSTEP SOLUTIONS, INC.",R44,2018,99999,ME-01,0.02031087234803508
"Machine learning of physiological variables to predict diagnose and treat cardiorespiratory instability Project Summary/Abstract: If one could accurately predict who, when and why patients develop cardiorespiratory instability (CRI), then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve outcome and better use care resources. However, CRI is often unrecognized until it is well established and patients are more refractory to treatment, or progressed to organ injury. We have shown that an integrated monitoring system alert obtained from continuous noninvasively acquired monitoring parameters and coupled to a care algorithm improved step-down unit (SDU) patient outcomes. We also showed that advanced HR variability analysis (sample entropy) identified SDU patients at CRI risk within 2 minutes, and if monitored for 5 minutes differentiated between patients who would develop CRI or remain stable over the next 48 hours. We also applied machine learning (ML) modeling to our clinically-relevant porcine model of hemorrhagic shock to characterize responses to hypovolemia, hemorrhage, and resuscitation, predict which animals would or would not collapse during hypovolemia, and identify occult bleeding 5 minutes earlier than with traditional monitoring. We now propose to apply our work to vulnerable and invasively monitored ICU patients. We will develop multivariable models through ML data-driven classification techniques such as regression, Fourier and principal component analysis, artificial neural networks, random forest classification, etc. as well as more novel approaches (temporal rule learning developed by our team; Bayesian Aggregation) to predict CRI in ICU patients. We will first use our existing annotated high fidelity waveform MIMIC II clinical data set (4200 patients) to develop predictive models and differential signatures for various CRI drivers. We will also use our high-density data collection and processing platform (Bernoulli) to prospectively collect data from ICUs in three institutions: Univ. Pittsburgh (PITT), Univ. California (UC) Irvine and UC San Diego (initial algorithm development conducted at PITT and validated in the UC systems). We will identify the number and type of independent measures, sampling frequency, and lead time necessary to create robust algorithms to: 1) predict impending CRI, 2) select the most effective treatments, 3) monitor treatment response, and 4) determine when treatment has restored physiologic stability and can be stopped. We will also determine the smallest number and types of parameters coupled to the longest CRI lead time to achieve the above four targets with the best sensitivity and specificity (a concept we call Monitoring Parsimony).We will simultaneously iteratively design and test a graphical user interface (GUI) and clinical decision support system (CDSS) driven by these parsimoniously derived predictive smart alerts and functional hemodynamic monitoring treatment approaches in two human simulation environments (PITT & UC Irvine).We envision a basic monitoring surveillance that identifies patients most likely to develop CRI to apply focused clinician attention and targeted treatments to deliver highly personalized medical care. Public Health Narrative If one could accurately predict who, when and why patients develop shock then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve outcome and more effectively use healthcare resources. But signs of shock often occur late once organ injury is already present. The purpose of this study is to first develop multivariable models through data-driven classification techniques to parsimoniously predict cardiovascular insufficiency, etiology and response to treatment. We will do this first in our existing MIMIC II clinical data sets of 4200 ICU patients as to timing and types of instability. Then we will prospectively collect real time high- density data on patients admitted to our trauma intensive care units of University of Pittsburgh, UC Irvine and UC San Diego. We will create and test in simulators of ICU care bedside user interfaces to drive recognition and treatment algorithms based on these models in all three medical centers.",Machine learning of physiological variables to predict diagnose and treat cardiorespiratory instability,9459930,R01GM117622,"['Algorithms ', ' Animals ', ' Attention ', ' California ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Critical Illness ', ' Critically Ill ', ' Data Collection ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' hemodynamics ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' blood loss ', ' Bleeding ', ' Homeostasis ', ' Physiological Homeostasis ', ' Autoregulation ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Intensive Care Units ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Libraries ', ' Physiologic Monitoring ', ' Physiological Monitoring ', ' mortality ', ' Pathologic Processes ', ' Pathological Processes ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Recommendation ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resuscitation ', ' Risk ', ' Running ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Shock ', ' circulatory shock ', ' Circulatory Collapse ', ' Hemorrhagic Shock ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Specificity ', ' Stress ', ' Family suidae ', ' suid ', ' porcine ', ' Swine ', ' Suidae ', ' Pigs ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Triage ', ' Universities ', ' Weaning ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' forest ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Normal Range ', ' Normal Values ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' density ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' mechanical respiratory assist ', ' Mechanical ventilation ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Refractory ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Medical ', ' insight ', ' Exposure to ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Entropy ', ' Principal Component Analysis ', ' Principal Component Analyses ', ' Hour ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Stream ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Clinical Decision Support Systems ', ' Hypovolemia ', ' Medical center ', ' diagnostic accuracy ', ' Accuracy of Diagnosis ', ' simulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Organ failure ', ' computerized data processing ', ' data processing ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' fitness ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Clinical Data ', ' trial treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Perioperative ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' early onset ', ' cost ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' bloodstream infection ', ' blood infection ', ' Sepsis ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' prospective ', ' Trauma ', ' Coupled ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' graphic user interface ', ' Graphical interface ', ' graphical user interface ', ' iterative design ', ' prototype ', ' high risk ', ' clinical care ', ' patient population ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' treatment response ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' data base structure ', ' database structure ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized medicine ', ' support tools ', ' improved outcome ', ' predictive tools ', ' clinical decision support ', ' individualized response ', ' individual response ', ' cardiovascular insufficiency ', ' artificial neural network ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,601883,PA-18,-0.035718232072422765
"Scalable Software for Distributed Processing and Visualization of Multi-Site MEG/EEG Datasets Project Summary During the past three decades non-invasive functional brain imaging has developed immensely in terms of measurement technologies, analysis methods, and innovative paradigms to capture information about brain function both in healthy and diseased individuals. Although functional MRI (fMRI) has become very useful, it only provides indirect information about neuronal activity through the neurovascular coupling with a limited temporal resolution. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) remain the only available noninvasive techniques capable of directly measuring the electrophysiological activity with a millisecond resolution. During the past eight years we have developed, with NIH support, the MNE-Python software, which covers multiple methods of data preprocessing, source localization, statistical analysis, and estimation of functional connectivity between distributed brain regions. All algorithms and utility functions are implemented in a consistent manner with well-documented interfaces, enabling users to create M/EEG data analysis pipelines by writing Python scripts. To further extend our software to meet the needs of a growing user base and reflect recent developments in the MEG/EEG field we will pursue three specific Aims. In Aim 1 we will: (i) Create an all-embracing suite of noise cancellation tools incorporating and extending methods present in different MEG systems; (ii) Implement device independent methods for head-movement determination and compensation on the basis of head movement data recorded during a MEG session; (iii) Develop methods for automatic tagging of artifacts using machine learning approaches. In Aim 2 our focus is to extend the software to make modern distributed computing resources easily usable in processing and to allow for remote visualization without the need to move large amounts of data across the network. Finally, in Aim 3, we will continue to develop MNE-Python using best programming practices ensuring multiplatform compatibility, extensive web-based documentation, training and forums, and hands-on training workshops. As a result of these developments the MNE-Python will be able to effectively process large number of subjects and huge amounts data ensuing and from multi-site studies harmoniously across different MEG/EEG systems. Narrative MEG and EEG can be used to understand and diagnose abnormalities underlying a wide range neurological and psychiatric illnesses including epilepsy, schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, autism spectrum disorders, and Alzheimer's disease, as well as cognitive deficits such as delayed acquisition of language. However, widespread use of these methods especially in large populations has been problematic because of the lack of well-established analysis approaches, which map the sensor data into the brain space for detailed temporal, spatial, and connectivity analysis. This research will provide well-documented and tested novel analysis software to promote both basic neuroscience and clinical research applications using MEG and EEG.",Scalable Software for Distributed Processing and Visualization of Multi-Site MEG/EEG Datasets,9594591,R01NS104585,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Epilepsy ', ' epileptogenic ', ' epileptiform ', ' epilepsia ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' Epileptics ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Head ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Laboratories ', ' Language Development ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Magnetoencephalography ', ' magnetoencephalographic imaging ', ' MEG imaging ', ' Maintenance ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Neurons ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Noise ', ' Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder ', ' Obsessive-Compulsive Neurosis ', ' Online Systems ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Science ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Writing ', ' Measures ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' falls ', ' symposium ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Ecological Systems ', ' Ecologic Systems ', ' Ecosystem ', ' Guidelines ', ' Visualization ', ' Imagery ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' brain visualization ', ' Brain imaging ', ' Site ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Pythons ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Compensation ', ' Financial compensation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' Measurement ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Head Movements ', ' Scientist ', ' millisecond ', ' Msec ', ' Hour ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' human data ', ' Cognitive deficits ', ' cognitive defects ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' software development ', ' developing computer software ', ' develop software ', ' Documentation ', ' Brain region ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Resolution ', ' Neurosciences Research ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' distributed computing ', ' datagrid ', ' data grid ', ' cluster computing ', ' visualization tool ', ' Visualization software ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' data acquisition ', ' computational resources ', ' computing resources ', ' open source ', ' multithreading ', ' verification and validation ', ' cloud computer ', ' Cloud Infrastructure ', ' Cloud Computing ', ' cloud based ', ' time measurement ', ' temporal resolution ', ' temporal measurement ', ' pedagogy ', ' Data Scientist ', ' Data Science ', ' neuro-vascular coupling ', ' neurovascular coupling ', ' source localization ', ' sensing technology ', ' sensor technology ', ' ']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2018,561118,MA-08,-0.004708745573298284
"The Blackfynn Platform for Rapid Data Integration and Collaboration Summary One in seven people worldwide suffers from a brain disorder, e.g., epilepsy, Parkinson's, stroke, or dementia. Development of future treatments depends on improving our understanding of brain function and disease, and validating new treatments critically depends on identifying the underlying biomarkers associated with different conditions. Biomarker discovery requires volume, quality, richness, and diversity of data. This Direct-to-Phase II project extends Blackfynn's cloud data management platform for team science, in order to support interactive data curation and integration and to facilitate biomarker discovery. Our first technical aim develops tools to help select, curate, assess, and regularize datasets: we develop novel “live” query capabilities to ensure users discover relevant data, develop mechanisms for using data's provenance to decide on trustworthiness, and build tools for mapping fields to common data elements. These capabilities address the critical, under-served problem of selecting the data to analyze. Our second technical aim develops techniques for incorporating algorithms to link and co-register across multi-modal data and metadata. Using ranking and machine learning, we can incorporate and combine state-of-the-art algorithms for finding data relationships, and we can link to remote data sources. These capabilities enable scientists to analyze richer datasets with multiple data modalities and properties – thus enabling them to discover more complex correlations and biomarkers. In our third aim, Blackfynn's new technical capabilities will be applied to challenges faced by Blackfynn partners, including problems assessing trustworthiness of data annotations, conducting image analysis, modeling epileptic networks, and identifying biomarkers for neuro-oncology indications. As part of this validation we will also develop HIPAA-compliant mechanisms for working with protected and de-identified data together. Together, these three thrusts will ensure that development of the Blackfynn platform results in tools and technologies that meaningfully accelerate scientific understanding and discovery over rich and complex data, leading to improved treatments for neurologic disease.   Narrative This Direct-to-Phase II project extends the Blackfynn cloud data management platform to enable biomarker discovery for research and development of improved drugs, devices and clinical care for patients with neurologic disease: it develops tools for assembling, evaluating, and rating data, and linking it across modalities and to external systems.

Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) cloud provides computing as a utility, on-demand, to end users, enabling cloud resources to be rapidly provisioned and scaled to meet computational and performance requirements. In addition, dynamic intelligent allocation of cloud computing resources has great potential to both improve performance and reduce hosting costs. Unfortunately, determining the most cost-effective and efficient ways to deploy modules on the cloud is non- trivial, due to a plethora of cloud vendors, each providing different types of virtual machines with different capabilities, performance trade-offs, and pricing structures. In addition, modern bioinformatics workflows consist of multiple modules, applications and libraries, each with their own set of software dependencies. Software containers package binary executables and scripts into modules with their software dependencies. With containers that compartmentalize software dependencies, modules implemented as containers can be mixed and matched to create workflows that give identical results on any platform. The high degree of reproducibility and flexibility of software containers makes them ideal instruments for disseminating complex bioinformatics workflows. Our overarching goal is to deliver the latest technological advances in containers and cloud computing to a typical biomedical researcher with limited resources who works with big data. Specifically, we will develop a user-friendly drag-and-drop interface to enable biomedical researchers to build and edit containerized workflows. Most importantly, users can choose to deploy and scale selected modules in the workflow on cloud computing platforms in a transparent, yet guided fashion, to optimize cost and performance. Our aim is to provide a federated approach that leverages resources from multiple cloud vendors. We have assembled a team of interdisciplinary scientists with expertise in bioinformatics, cloud and distributed computing, and machine learning. As part of this application, we will work closely with end users who routinely generate and analyze RNA-seq data. We will illustrate how our containerized, cloud-enabled methods and tools will benefit bioinformatics analyses. Project Narrative Cloud computing has emerged as a promising solution to address the challenge of analyzing diverse and massive data generated to advance our understanding of health and diseases. We will develop methods and tools to build and intelligently deploy modular and cloud-enabled bioinformatics workflows. These tools will allow the biomedical community to optimize the costs associated with cloud computing and to facilitate the replication of scientific results.",Intelligent deployment of containerized bioinformatics workflows on the cloud,9422475,R01GM126019,"['Communities ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Drug toxicity ', ' Feedback ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' Libraries ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Privatization ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vendor ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Price ', ' pricing ', ' Technical Expertise ', ' technical skills ', ' Case Study ', ' case report ', ' Schedule ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Ensure ', ' data storage ', ' data retrieval ', ' Data Storage and Retrieval ', ' Technology Transfer ', ' tool ', ' instrument ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Services ', ' Performance ', ' biomedical scientist ', ' Structure ', ' expectation ', ' outreach ', ' Modeling ', ' RNA analysis ', ' Documentation ', ' Drops ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Educational Materials ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Docking ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' cost ', ' virtual ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' distributed data ', ' distributed computing ', ' datagrid ', ' data grid ', ' cluster computing ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' computational resources ', ' computing resources ', ' user-friendly ', ' graphic user interface ', ' Graphical interface ', ' graphical user interface ', ' tool development ', ' prototype ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' cloud computer ', ' Cloud Infrastructure ', ' Cloud Computing ', ' BigData ', ' Big Data ', ' big biomedical data ', ' Cloud Service ', ' cloud server ', ' cloud platform ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2018,356646,WA-07,0.008930312471133307
"Towards a FAIR Digital Ecosystem in the Cloud Cloud Computing, Big Data Analytics, and Artificial Intelligence are transforming biomedical research. The NIH Data Commons will provide a common, cloud-agnostic, harmonized environment where these technologies can be deployed to serve NIH intra- and extra-mural researchers, implementing FAIR principles [Wilkinson2016]. Our proposal provides two essential capabilities: (1) Global Unique Identification (GUIDs) and (2) Digital Object Publication, Citation, Replication and Reuse. We propose a FAIR biomedical ecosystem where all primary and derived digital objects (e.g., datasets, software) receive GUIDs, assisting with Findability and Accessibility, Reusability, data provenance, reproducibility, and accountability of research outcomes. GUIDs will provide full Interoperability between DOIs and prefix: accession based Compact Identifiers through a common resolution services prefix registry. All digital objects will interoperate with multiple, hybrid clouds—open source and commercial—enabling researchers to select computing resources best matching their needs. 1 - The Global Unique Identifier (GUID) Capability provides a persistent, machine resolvable identifier platform for all FAIR objects in the Commons, fully aligned with community practices, recommendations, and metadata models. 2 - The Cloud Dataverse for Biomedical Digital Object Publication, Citation, Replication, and Reuse applies FAIR principles to primary and derived datasets, computational provenance, and software, making them fully FAIR compliant, while documenting the production processes. Cloud Dataverse integrates with multiple cloud computing solutions. As an example, with these capabilities, a researcher can extract a subset of data from TOPMed or GTEx and publish it in Cloud Dataverse, with its associated metadata, provenance, and terms of use. In publications, she can cite the data and software according to Data Citation Publishers guidelines [Cousijn2017] and Software Citation Principles [Smith2016]. Other researchers can access the dataset using the GUID in the citation, resolving the repository’s dataset landing page (as recommended by the Data Citation Principles [Martone2014, Fenner2017, Starr2015]). From this landing page, researchers can repeat the original calculation, perform new computations on the dataset, or use the provenance graph to learn how the dataset was created. The data and software published in the repository reflect the evolving nature of research; anyone can publish new versions with the provenance documenting the process. Our open-source software platforms used in production, adhere to FAIR principles, and provide the basis for the two capabilities: GUIDs and Cloud Dataverse enabling the use cases above. We will expand upon them, produce new tools, and reach a wider community. Currently GUIDs and provenance describe datasets; we will generalize these mechanisms to support other digital objects, focusing on software in the pilot phase. We will connect and harmonize DataCite, identifiers.org, and N2T/EZID services to provide GUIDs; and integrate the Dataverse repository software with the Massachusetts Open Cloud, built on top of the OpenStack cloud platform, and public commercial clouds (Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud) to provide Cloud Dataverse. Our past experience producing sustainable services for overlapping communities of developers and users demonstrates our ability to apply our expertise to supporting the larger and more diverse NIH Data Commons user community.

"Automatic Recognition of Diet, Physical Activity and Sedentary Behavior Using a Smart Wearable Device Automatic Recognition of Diet, Physical Activity and Sedentary Behavior  Using a Smart Wearable Device  Lifestyle and behavioral factors, such as diet, physical activity, and sedentary behavior, play important roles in human health. A recent report in Lancet has found that, globally, among the top-17 risk factors of human diseases, “diet risks”, “child and maternal malnutrition” and “low physical activity” ranked No.1, No. 3 and No. 14, respectively. Due to the increased adoption of unhealthy lifestyle, such as high-calorie, low-nutrient diet and decreased physical activity, chronic diseases are rising rapidly. For example, from 1980 to 2014, worldwide diabetic cases increased from 108 million to 422 million, and Americans’ life expectancy declined in 2015 for the first time since 1993. In order to assist the research community to study people’s lifestyle and develop effective interventional strategies, especially for chronic diseases such as diabetes to control their diet and increase physical activity, we have developed the eButton. The eButton is a miniature wearable computer pinned on the chest region to assess diet, physical activity and sedentary behavior. After several generations of redesigns, the eButton has now been shrunk to the size of an Oreo cookie while its functionality has greatly increased. We have conducted several studies evaluating the eButton with both adults and children. Our studies have shown that this device is well accepted by human subjects, and is suitable for collecting passively and conveniently large amounts of lifestyle data in real-life. However, post processing of field-collected data has been time-consuming, mainly due to required manual procedures to review thousands of images for identification of eating and other events of research interest. Privacy concerns were also expressed by some participants on recording images in their living and working environments and manual review of the recorded images. These significant problems must be solved before this important tool is utilized for large-scale clinical studies.  Powerful solution to solve these problems can be found in the most recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI). By equipping the eButton with the AI capacity, we can effectively transform this passive data collection device to a mini-robot that travels with the human subject, observes the world around it, takes quick notes (in English text) at an astonishing speed, stores these notes in a compact form within the eButton, and discards raw images immediately except for food images which may need a dietitian to analyze. If this new concept can be successfully implemented, there will be no need to review thousands of images, and the risk of privacy breach is avoided because sensitive images are no longer stored within the device. Since the eButton will only be taught to recognize a limited number of dietary activities, physical activity and sedentary behaviors, this device will produce the desired information of research interest, but will never cross the privacy intrusion boundary.  In this application, our team of experienced engineers and lifestyle scientists proposes to implement this new concept. We will develop an efficient human activity recognition algorithm personalized for each human subject. This algorithm utilizes both the subject’s daily routine information and the information extracted from selected sensors. The data from these sensors will be examined sequentially to test the validity of a number of candidate activities. We will develop miniature electronic circuits to implement a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) within the eButton. This field- programmable gate array (FPGA) based implementation will enable real-time robotic reading of images and integrate the textual notes produced by the CNN with the personalized human activity recognition algorithm. Finally, we will perform a thorough evaluation study using human subjects to determine the accuracy of our activity recognition approach. This application aims to develop a personalized human activity recognition algorithm and to implement this algorithm using electronic hardware within a wearable device for the assessment of diet, physical activity and sedentary behavior.","Automatic Recognition of Diet, Physical Activity and Sedentary Behavior Using a Smart Wearable Device",9717583,R56DK113819,"['Over weight ', ' computerized data processing ', ' Home ', ' Data ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' negative affectivity ', ' Weight ', ' Data Collection ', ' wearable sensor ', ' Diet ', ' Disease ', ' Obesity ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Evaluation Studies ', ' Eating ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Play ', ' Food ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' Health ', ' Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' Goals ', ' Algorithms ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Robotics ', ' Role ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Reading ', ' Elderly ', ' Human ', ' Human Activities ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavioral Research ', ' Suggestion ', ' Child ', ' Manuals ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Life Style ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Travel ', ' Generations ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Methods ', ' Time ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' design ', ' lifestyle data ', ' Food Intake ', ' Image ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' negative affect ', ' human disease ', ' Text ', ' Wearable Computer ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Handicapped ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' disabled ', ' disabled individual ', ' disabled people ', ' individuals with disabilities ', ' lifestyle factors ', ' experimental study ', ' digital models ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' sedentary lifestyle ', ' unhealthy lifestyle ', ' healthy lifestyle ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' diabetes ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' blind ', ' wearable device ', ' dietary ', ' Privacy ', ' Communities ', ' digital ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' effective intervention ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' neural network ', ' imaging ', ' Wearable Computing ', ' Sedentary behavior ', ' Sedentary life-style ', ' designing ', ' Thorace ', ' Thoracic ', ' Thorax ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematic model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' disease risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Nutritional Deficiency ', ' Undernutrition ', ' dietary deficiency ', ' malnourished ', ' nutrition deficiency ', ' nutrition deficiency disorder ', ' nutritional deficiency disorder ', ' social role ', ' data processing ', ' Job Location ', ' Job Place ', ' Job Setting ', ' Job Site ', ' Work Location ', ' Work Place ', ' Work-Site ', ' Worksite ', ' work setting ', ' Behavioral ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' experience ', ' Chest ', ' pilot study ', ' Performance ', ' Individual ', ' diabetic ', ' Dietitian ', ' Scientist ', ' Adopted ', ' theories ', ' base ', ' human subject ', ' sensor ', ' Procedures ', ' Calories ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Home environment ', ' mathematical model ', ' System ', ' Intervention ', ' Speed ', ' Nutrient ', ' Participant ', ' disorder risk ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulentia ', ' Overweight ', ' obese ', ' obese people ', ' obese person ', ' obese population ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Biological Neural Networks ', ' Robot ', ' tool ', ' interest ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Malnutrition ', ' American ', ' Workplace ', ' Descriptor ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R56,2018,489821,PA-18,-0.006270465589370296
"Top-down control of auditory processing in the cortico-collicular network Project Summary Throughout life, humans and other animals learn statistical regularities in the acoustic environment and adapt their hearing to emphasize the elements of sound that are important for behavioral decisions. Using these abilities, normal-hearing humans are able to perceive important sounds in crowded noisy environments and understand the speech of individuals the first time they meet. However, patients with peripheral hearing loss or central processing disorders often have problems hearing in these challenging settings, even when sound is amplified above perceptual threshold. This study seeks to characterize how two major areas in the brain's auditory network, auditory cortex and midbrain inferior colliculus, establish an interface between incoming auditory signals and the internal brain states that select information appropriate to the current behavioral context. Single-unit neural activity will be recorded from both of these brain areas in awake ferrets during the presentation of complex naturalistic sounds that mimic the acoustic environment encountered in the real world. Internal brain state will be controlled by selective attention to specific sound features in these complex stimuli. Changes in stimulus-evoked neural activity as attention shifts among sound features will be measured to identify interactions between internal state and incoming sensory signals in these different areas. Previous work has identified a large corticofugal projection from auditory cortex to inferior colliculus that could produce task-dependent changes in selectivity in inferior colliculus. This study will test the role of these corticofugal projections by optogenetic inactivation of auditory cortex during recordings from inferior colliculus. Selective inactivation of specific pathways will characterize how the network of brain areas works together to produce effective auditory behaviors. Computational modeling tools will be used to determine, from an algorithmic perspective, how neurons encode information about the natural stimuli and how this encoding changes as attention is shifted between features. Data collected during behavior will be used to develop models that combine bottom-up sensory processing and top-down behavioral control. This computational approach builds on classic characterizations of neural stimulus-response relationships using spectro-temporal receptive field models. New models will be developed that incorporate behavioral state variables and nonlinear biological circuit elements into established model frameworks. Together, these studies will provide new insight into the computational strategies used by the behaving brain to process complex sounds in real-world contexts. Project Narrative Patients with hearing impairments and central neurological disorders have difficulty processing and making accurate judgments about auditory stimuli, particular in challenging noisy environments. We seek to understand how the healthy brain learns to extract useful information from sounds in order to guide effective behavior. These experiments will provide novel insight into how the brain solves problems that can be used to develop new devices and treatments for these debilitating conditions.",Top-down control of auditory processing in the cortico-collicular network,9408628,R01DC014950,"['Acoustics ', ' Acoustic ', ' Algorithms ', ' Animals ', ' Attention ', ' Auditory area ', ' Auditory Cortex ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Crowding ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Feedback ', ' Ferrets ', ' Hearing ', ' sound perception ', ' hearing perception ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Inferior Colliculus ', ' Posterior Quadrigeminal Body ', ' Judgment ', ' Learning ', ' Mammals ', ' Mammalia ', ' Midbrain structure ', ' Midbrain ', ' Mid-brain ', ' Mesencephalon ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurons ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Research ', ' Rewards ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' sound ', ' Speech ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' auditory stimulus ', ' base ', ' hearing prosthetic ', ' hearing prosthesis ', ' ear prosthetic ', ' ear prosthesis ', ' auricular prosthetic ', ' Auricular prosthesis ', ' Peripheral ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' Nonlinear Models ', ' Non-linear Models ', ' Link ', ' selective attention ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' awake ', ' receptive field ', ' Individual ', ' hearing disease ', ' Hearing Disorders ', ' Hearing problem ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Behavior Control ', ' behavioral control ', ' Behavioral Manipulation ', ' Life ', ' Auditory ', ' Complex ', ' Stream ', ' Sensory ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Response to stimulus physiology ', ' stimulus/response ', ' Auditory system ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Structure ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Central Auditory Processing Disorder ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' behavior influence ', ' behavioral influence ', ' hearing impairment ', ' Hypoacusis ', ' Hypoacuses ', ' Hearing Loss ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Synaptic plasticity ', ' Impairment ', ' optogenetics ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' auditory processing ', ' ']",NIDCD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,327250,OR-03,-0.01812324337920666
"THE XNAT IMAGING INFORMATICS PLATFORM PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal aims to continue the development of XNAT. XNAT is an imaging informatics platform designed to facilitate common management and productivity tasks for imaging and associated data.

"MHealth Monitoring of Acoustic and Behavioral Patterns in Bipolar Disorder Across Cultures Abstract: The ability to prioritize individuals for health care based on behavioral and acoustic patterns in speech will allow for efficient use of health care resources. The ability to predict mood states using daily monitoring of acoustics derived from mobile technology provides the basis for a real-time proxy measure of moods and affective states. Identification and monitoring of these and other dimensional features of human disease is the base for anticipating outcomes, offering the future possibility of timely and mitigating interventions. Technological and mHealth methods are well suited for the global health community due to the flexibility and adaptability of the approach; the capacity to reach large numbers of patients can be easily amplified with modest increase in infrastructure. We have developed an accurate prediction model for mood states in bipolar (BP) individuals using machine-learning strategies and established a process that involves preprocessing, feature extraction, and an integrated data analysis of clinical and acoustic data gathered from personal use of a mobile device for up to one year. The results show mood states are predicted with an AUC statistic of 0.74 (mania) and 0.77 (depression). We hypothesize that analyses across cultures will identify common features of illness that can be identified using our methods. BP is ideal for study because of the wide range of mood states and temperamental traits. This study aims to 1) ascertain 30 individuals with BP and 10 healthy controls from Lebanon and a multilingual community in SE Michigan, recording daily acoustic and behavioral data using a smart-phone, all outgoing speech from the device is gathered and all personal digital activity is recorded from the device. We propose to study participants in Lebanon and SE Michigan in order to identify the fundamental acoustic elements of mood variation among bipolar patients. 2) apply integrated computational analyses using static (Gaussian Mixture Models and Support Vector Machines) and dynamic (Hidden Markov Models) modeling of categorical, dimensional and derived features from clinical, acoustic, and behavioral signals; we will compare data from the 15 BP from Lebanon and 15 BP from SE Michigan that have been resident in USA >2 years but originate from a geographical region comparable to Lebanon in language and culture, and 15 American born BP Caucasians (from our current cohort). Our hypothesis is that there are fundamental elements of acoustics that associate with mood states regardless of the culture. The impact is the longitudinal use of mobile technology to passively gather personal data to establish computational models that use extensive individual state and trait data to accurately predict mood and health states. This provides a foundation for predictive modeling that can be integrated into subsequent clinical interventional studies to predict and test causal effects of specific interventions on disease mechanisms. Expertise in clinical, computational, and technology disciplines form the team to realize these goals. This is a study that focuses on the ability of technological methods to detect speech and behavioral patterns in patients with bipolar disorder across cultural boundaries to identify common features that predict mood states. The overall goal is to use computational methods for the early detection of affect and mood changes that will provide the opportunity to monitor mood disorders using common methods regardless of cultural differences.",MHealth Monitoring of Acoustic and Behavioral Patterns in Bipolar Disorder Across Cultures,9566306,R21MH114835,"['Acoustics ', ' Acoustic ', ' Affect ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Communities ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Emotions ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' geographic site ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Immigration ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Interview ', ' Language ', ' Lebanon ', ' Locales ', ' Methods ', ' Michigan ', ' Middle East ', ' Moods ', ' Patients ', ' Probability ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Safety ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Speech ', ' Supervision ', ' Technology ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Temperament ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Caucasians ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' psychiatric treatment ', ' psychiatric therapy ', ' psychiatric care ', ' Psychiatric therapeutic procedure ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' Immigrant ', ' Arabs ', ' Multilingualism ', ' tool ', ' Manic ', ' Manic State ', ' Manias ', ' Depressed mood ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' cognitive function ', ' Dimensions ', ' Severities ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Pattern ', ' Country ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' American ', ' data management ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' cohort ', ' trait ', ' Proxy ', ' Participant ', ' Categories ', ' Devices ', ' Health Technology ', ' Health Care Technology ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Address ', ' global health ', ' Symptoms ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' computer analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computational analyses ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' Pathologic ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Community Health ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' meta data ', ' Metadata ', ' digital ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Social Functioning ', ' markov model ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Impairment ', ' Affective ', ' human disease ', ' lexical processing ', ' lexical ', ' mobile device ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' Secure ', ' Bipolar 1 ', ' Bipolar I ', ' mobile health ', ' m-Health ', ' mHealth ', ' Patient Triage ', ' bipolar patients ', ' health data ', ' Gaussianity model ', ' Gaussianity ', ' Gaussian statistics ', ' Gaussian model ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' mobile technology ', ' mobile platform ', ' mobile computing ', ' LMIC ', ' low and middle-income countries ', ' predictive assay ', ' predictive test ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R21,2018,159091,MI-12,-0.056218837026382126
"iFACS: Imaging Florescence Activated Cell Sorter to sort cells based on images iFACS: Imaging Florescence Activated Cell Sorter to sort cells based on images NanoCellect Biomedical, Inc. RESEARCH & RELATED Other Project Information 7. PROJECT SUMMARY Advances in reagents (e.g. CRiSPR) and analytical tools (e.g. flow cytometers) have improved the ability to alter and characterize cellular phenotypes. Ultimately, many key applications in biomedicine require efficient and accurate isolation of cell populations according to features contained in high content images. Unfortunately, microscopic laser microdissection systems have a throughput that is too slow to be practical in many applications; while the existing flow cytometers that can sort cells (fluorescence-activated cell sorters or FACS) provide only size, internal complexity, and fluorescence intensity information and lack the rich data of imaging. Another critical limitation is that the existing flow cytometers that can image, cannot sort cells. NanoCellect has made a highly affordable FACS to increase access to this important high-throughput tool for cell analysis. Here we propose to enhance our existing low-cost FACS with the ability to image cells and sort them based on image features. This will allow users to pursue new strategies in drug screening and mechanism of action research; as well as work with suspension cell lines, such as those that dominate the recent advances in immuno-oncology. In Phase I research, we have demonstrated the world's first imaging flow cytometer with cell sorting capabilities (iFACS) in a unique design of space-time coding with an optical spatial filter. The approach adds negligible cost to the system for the desirable features of cell imaging and sorting. To fully realize the enormous potential of the design and to meet the demands for most applications, in Phase II we will develop high-throughput image-based cell sorting with innovative image-guided gating schemes supported by machine learning and interactive user/machine interface. Essentially, image-based flow cytometry gating uses similar cell isolation criteria as the techniques of laser capture microdissection or cell aspiration to isolate cells of interest, with 10,000X throughput improvements to 1000+ cells per second. We envision such unique capabilities will become common, default features for tomorrow's users as the tool becomes as intuitive and ubiquitous as fluorescent microscopy. The proposed iFACS will be transformative and benefit numerous biomedical applications, such as isolation of cells based on organelle translocation, cell cycle analyses, detection and counting of phagocytosed particles, and protein co-localization, to name just a few. iFACS: Imaging Florescence Activated Cell Sorter to sort cells based on images NanoCellect Biomedical, Inc.

"Socioeconomic status, stress, and smoking cessation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The prevalence of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) is rising dramatically among both adults and youth and ENDS use is fast becoming a major public health issue. However, because of their recent emergence, researchers know little about ENDS, their use, their effects on human physiology and health, their risks and benefits, or their impact on tobacco control efforts. A common barrier to studying ENDS is the lack of data on objective, real world use of ENDS. Thus, the proposed project aims to adapt existing innovative mobile assessment tools that can be used to target critical ENDS research gaps by providing mobile sensing technology that can objectively collect precise data regarding ENDS use in real time in real world. Specifically, the proposed revision project will expand the scope of Project On Track (1R01CA190329-01A1, PI: Wetter) by extending the application of puffMarker, an existing tool that automatically detects smoking, for the assessment of ENDS use. The current project has three aims: 1) adapt and validate puffMarker to identify discrete episodes of ENDS use, 2) adapt and validate puffMarker to distinguish between cigarette smoking and ENDS use among dual users of ENDS and cigarettes, and 3) utilize the Project On Track protocol to collect real time, real world data investigating potential determinants of ENDS use among both exclusive ENDS users as well as dual users of cigarettes and ENDS. Altogether, 120 participants (30 for Aim 1, 30 for Aim 2, and 60 for Aim 3) will be enrolled. Participants recruited for Aims 1 and 2 will attend laboratory (three 2-hour sessions) and field (3 days) studies. In the laboratory sessions, participants will wear the AutoSense wireless sensors and be asked to use ENDS (Aim 1) or use ENDS and smoke a cigarette (Aim 2). Participants' ENDS and cigarette puffs will be recorded by an independent observer. In the field studies, participants will wear the AutoSense wireless sensors and be asked to use ENDS (Aim 1) or use ENDS and smoke cigarettes (Aim 2). Participants will be asked to record each instance of ENDS use or cigarette smoking on a SP. The goals of the laboratory studies are to collect data to train puffMarker to identify ENDS use and to distinguish between cigarette smoking and ENDS use. The goal of the field studies is to validate puffMarker in real-life, natural environments. Aim 3 will utilize the Project On Track protocol to collect the first real time, real world data on ENDS and dual use. Participants will be assessed for 6 days using AutoSense, EMA, and GPS to examine potential determinants of ENDS use. A validated puffMarker that detects ENDS use and distinguishes between ENDS use and smoking can enhance many areas of research inquiry on ENDS. Knowledge learned from Aim 3 will be essential for the development of comprehensive conceptual models with respect to ENDS use and smoking cessation. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project aims to develop an innovative tool that targets important ENDS research gaps by offer- ing researchers the latest mobile sensing technology to objectively collect precise data regarding ENDS use and distinguish between ENDS use and smoking in real time and in real world.","Socioeconomic status, stress, and smoking cessation",9547313,R01CA190329,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Algorithms ', ' Breathing ', ' inspiration ', ' Respiratory Inspiration ', ' Respiratory Aspiration ', ' Behavior ', ' Environment ', ' Geography ', ' Gestures ', ' Goals ', ' Hand ', ' Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Laboratories ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Physiology ', ' Public Health ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Stress ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' Wrist ', ' Measures ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Series ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Training ', ' Mouth ', ' Cavitas Oris ', ' Buccal Cavity Head and Neck ', ' Buccal Cavity ', ' Oral cavity ', ' Individual ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' cigarette use ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' participant recruitment ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' uptake ', ' tool ', ' Smoker ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' respiratory ', ' psychosocial ', ' experience ', ' field study ', ' field test ', ' field learning ', ' field based data ', ' Cigarette ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Harm Reduction ', ' Harm Minimization ', ' Laboratory Study ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Chest ', ' Thorax ', ' Thoracic ', ' Thorace ', ' Modeling ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' wireless ', ' Wireless Technology ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' tobacco control ', ' biobehavioral ', ' biobehavior ', ' systems research ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Abstinence ', ' addictive disorder ', ' addiction ', ' parent grant ', ' primary outcome ', ' population health ', ' Secondary Student ', ' Secondary School Student ', ' High School Student ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' built environment ', ' arm movement ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' Assessment tool ', ' BD2K ', ' Big Data to Knowledge ', ' data into knowledge ', ' data to knowledge ', ' electronic nicotine delivery device ', ' Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems ', ' Long-term cohort study ', ' Longitudinal cohort study ', ' recruit ', ' sensing technology ', ' sensor technology ', ' wearable sensor ', ' wearable device ', ' Inhaling ', ' Inhalation ', ' cigarette user ', ' cigarette smoke ', ' Grain ', ' real time monitoring ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2018,1,UT-02,0.026124656505164746
"New Computational Methods for Data-driven Protein Structure Prediction Proteins and their interactions play fundamental roles in all biological processes. Accurate description of protein structure and interactions is a fundamental step towards understanding biological life and highly relevant in the development of therapeutics and drugs. However, there is a large gap between the number of available protein sequences and the number of proteins (complexes) with solved structures and accurate interaction description, which has to be filled by computational prediction. The long-term goal of this project is to apply statistical machine learning and optimization algorithms to understand protein sequence-structure-function relationship by analyzing low- and high-throughput sequence, structure and functional data and to develop algorithms for structure and functional prediction. Our hypothesis is that by developing sophisticated algorithms to take advantage of the growing sequence and structure data, we can model sequence-structure relationship much more accurately and significantly improve structure and functional prediction, in particular for this proposal, residue (atomic) interaction strength prediction and remote homology detection. This project has produced a few CASP-winning, widely-used data-driven algorithms and web server (http://raptorx.uchicago.edu) for monomer protein modeling. This renewal will not only further develop machine learning algorithms (especially Deep Learning and probabilistic graphical models) for monomer proteins, but also branch out to protein interactions (complexes). The specific aims are: (1) develop novel structure learning algorithms to predict inter-reside contacts and coevolved residues; (2) develop context-specific, coevolution-based, and distance-dependent statistical potentials using a new machine learning model called Deep Conditional (Markov) Neural Fields (DeepCNF); (3) develop Markov Random Fields (MRF) and DeepCNF methods for remote protein (interface/complex) homology detection and fold recognition to make use of long-range residue interaction predicted by the first two aims. This renewal will lead to further understanding and new models of protein sequence-structure-function relationship and yield publicly available software and servers for automated, accurate, quantitative analysis for a wide range of proteins and their interactions. The impact will be multiplied by tens of thousands of worldwide users employing the resulting software/servers to study a wide variety of proteins and interactions relevant to basic biological research and human diseases, in both low- and high-throughput experiments. Proteins and their interactions play fundamental roles in all biological processes including the maintenance of cellular integrity, metabolism, transcription/translation, and cell-cell communication. This proposal develops algorithms to understand protein sequence-structure-function relationship and to predict protein structures and interactions. The results will lead to a broad range of biomedical applications, such as better understanding of disease processes, development of novel diagnostics and drugs, and improved preventive therapies leading to reduced health care costs.",New Computational Methods for Data-driven Protein Structure Prediction,9545787,R01GM089753,"['Algorithms ', ' Amino Acid Sequence ', ' protein sequence ', ' Primary Protein Structure ', ' Cell Communication ', ' Cell-to-Cell Interaction ', ' Cell Interaction ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Joints ', ' Learning ', ' Maintenance ', ' Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Methods ', ' Molecular Biology ', ' DNA Molecular Biology ', ' Occupations ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Play ', ' Probability ', ' Proteins ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Structure-Activity Relationship ', ' structure function relationship ', ' chemical structure function ', ' Supervision ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Translations ', ' Work ', ' Sequence Alignment ', ' sequencing alignment ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Lasso ', ' Homologous Sequences ', ' Sequence Homologs ', ' protein folding ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' Individual ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Distant ', ' Techniques ', ' monomer ', ' protein structure function ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' protein complex ', ' Homologous Gene ', ' Homologue ', ' Homolog ', ' GeneHomolog ', ' Protein Family ', ' protein structure ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' protein structure prediction ', ' Coupling ', ' biological research ', ' human disease ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new drugs ', ' new drug treatments ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' next generation diagnostics ', ' new diagnostics ', ' novel diagnostics ', ' therapeutic agent development ', ' therapeutic development ', ' atomic interactions ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' Preventative therapy ', ' Preventive therapy ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' deep learning ', ' ']",NIGMS,TOYOTA TECHNOLOGICAL INSTITUTE / CHICAGO,R01,2018,306425,IL-01,0.009080675458251019
"Developing Evidence- based User Centered Design and Implementation Guidelines to Improve Health Information Technology Usability ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of the proposed research is to provide an evidence-base to better inform user centered design and implementation processes to improve health information technology (health IT) usability and safety. The proposed research is in direct response to special emphasis notice (NOT-HS-15-005). Utilizing a hybrid approach of expert manual review and machine learning techniques, specifically natural language processing, we will develop methods to rapidly analyze patient safety event data to determine which events are health IT related. We will then further categorize the health IT related safety events to determine which events could have been prevented by effective usability or implementation processes. Through this analysis we will be able to specify the usability and implementation processes that are critical to the safe and effective use of health IT. This project utilizes the extensive expertise of the research team in human factors and safety science, health IT, and computer science. The proposed research is based on unique insights that our team gleaned from previous research that we conducted focusing on health IT vendor design and implementation processes. The application addresses fundamental aspects of the call for applications by providing an evidence base to improve health IT usability and safety to better inform policy and practice. This research effort is being conducted in partnership with a health IT vendor and a patient safety organization to ensure that our results align with vendor needs and to ensure the results are generalizable. Contributions from this research will include a fundamental understanding of the critical user centered design and implementation processes to inform vendor and provider practice. Our research will also provide organizations like the Office of the National Coordinator with the information to better inform health IT policy.

"User-driven Retrospectively Supervised Classification Updating (RESCU) system for robust upper limb prosthesis control ABSTRACT Approximately 41,000 individuals live with upper-limb loss (loss of at least one hand) in the US. Fortunately, prosthetic devices have advanced considerably in the past decades with the development of dexterous, anthropomorphic hands. However, potentially the most promising used control strategy, myoelectric control, lacks a correspondingly high-level of performance and hence the use of dexterous hands remains highly limited. The need for a complete overhaul in upper limb prosthesis control is well highlighted by the abandonment rates of myoelectric devices, which can reach up to 40% in the case of trans-humeral amputees. The area of research that has received the most focus over the past decade has been “pattern recognition,” which is a signal processing based control method that uses multi-channel surface electromyography as the control input. While pattern recognition provides intuitive operation of multiple prosthetic degrees of freedom, it lacks robustness and requires frequent, often daily calibration. Thus, it has not yet achieved the desired clinical acceptance. Our team proposes clinical translation of a novel highly adaptive upper limb prosthesis control system that incorporates two major advances: 1) machine learning (robust classification by implementing a non-boundary based algorithm), and 2) training by retrospectively incorporating user data from activities of daily living (ADL). The proposed system will enable machine intelligence with user input for prosthesis control. Our work is organized as follows: Phase I: (a) First, we will implement a fundamentally new machine intelligence technique, Extreme Learning Machine with Adaptive Sparse Representation Classification (EASRC), that is more resilient to untrained noisy conditions that users may encounter in the real-world and requires less data than traditional myoelectric signal processing. (b) In parallel, we will implement an adaptive learning algorithm, Nessa, which allows users to relabel misclassified data recorded during use and then update the EASRC classifier to adapt to any major extrinsic or intrinsic changes in the signals. Taken together, EASRC and Nessa comprise the Retrospectively Supervised Classification Updating (RESCU) system. Once, the RESCU implementation is complete, we will optimize the system through a joint effort with Johns Hopkins University, and complete an iterative benchtop RESCU evaluation with a focus group of 3 amputee subjects and their prosthetists. Phase II: Verification and validation of RESCU will be completed, culminating in third-party validation testing and certification. Finally, we will complete a clinical assessment including self-reporting subjective measures, and real-world usage metrics in a long-term clinical study. PROJECT NARRATIVE In this project, we aim to empower the user by bringing them into the control loop of their prosthesis and improve the stability of their control strategy over time. Specifically, we implement to a robust classifier, an adaptive learning algorithm, and a smartwatch interface, which allows the user to teach their device when it misunderstands the commands that the user is sending to control the prosthesis. This will result in improved control without cumbersome or time-consuming effort on the part of the user and, more importantly, we hope that it will give the user a greater sense of empowerment and ownership over their prosthesis.",User-driven Retrospectively Supervised Classification Updating (RESCU) system for robust upper limb prosthesis control,9622537,U44NS108894,"['Activities of Daily Living ', ' functional capacity ', ' functional ability ', ' daily living functionality ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' Adoption ', ' Algorithms ', ' Amputees ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Calibration ', ' Certification ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communication ', ' Electromyography ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Freedom ', ' Liberty ', ' Goals ', ' Hand ', ' Joints ', ' Methods ', ' Ownership ', ' Research ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Supervision ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Prosthetics ', ' Prosthetic device ', ' Prosthesis ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Surface ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Intuition ', ' Individual ', ' satisfaction ', ' Systems Integration ', ' Limb Prosthesis ', ' prosthetic limb ', ' Artificial Limbs ', ' Artificial Extremities ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Performance ', ' novel ', ' empowerment ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Devices ', ' Upper Extremity ', ' Upper Limb ', ' Membrum superius ', ' Data ', ' Pattern Recognition ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' Update ', ' Validation ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' function improvement ', ' functional improvement ', ' verification and validation ', ' operation ', ' signal processing ', ' prosthetic control ', ' prosthesis control ', ' myoelectric control ', ' adaptive learning ', ' clinical translation ', ' ']",NINDS,"INFINITE BIOMEDICAL TECHNOLOGIES, LLC",U44,2018,216724,MD-07,0.05067815640548454
"Towards a FAIR Digital Ecosystem in the Cloud Cloud Computing, Big Data Analytics, and Artificial Intelligence are transforming biomedical research. The NIH Data Commons will provide a common, cloud-agnostic, harmonized environment where these technologies can be deployed to serve NIH intra- and extra-mural researchers, implementing FAIR principles [Wilkinson2016]. Our proposal provides two essential capabilities: (1) Global Unique Identification (GUIDs) and (2) Digital Object Publication, Citation, Replication and Reuse. We propose a FAIR biomedical ecosystem where all primary and derived digital objects (e.g., datasets, software) receive GUIDs, assisting with Findability and Accessibility, Reusability, data provenance, reproducibility, and accountability of research outcomes. GUIDs will provide full Interoperability between DOIs and prefix: accession based Compact Identifiers through a common resolution services prefix registry. All digital objects will interoperate with multiple, hybrid clouds—open source and commercial—enabling researchers to select computing resources best matching their needs. 1 - The Global Unique Identifier (GUID) Capability provides a persistent, machine resolvable identifier platform for all FAIR objects in the Commons, fully aligned with community practices, recommendations, and metadata models. 2 - The Cloud Dataverse for Biomedical Digital Object Publication, Citation, Replication, and Reuse applies FAIR principles to primary and derived datasets, computational provenance, and software, making them fully FAIR compliant, while documenting the production processes. Cloud Dataverse integrates with multiple cloud computing solutions. As an example, with these capabilities, a researcher can extract a subset of data from TOPMed or GTEx and publish it in Cloud Dataverse, with its associated metadata, provenance, and terms of use. In publications, she can cite the data and software according to Data Citation Publishers guidelines [Cousijn2017] and Software Citation Principles [Smith2016]. Other researchers can access the dataset using the GUID in the citation, resolving the repository’s dataset landing page (as recommended by the Data Citation Principles [Martone2014, Fenner2017, Starr2015]). From this landing page, researchers can repeat the original calculation, perform new computations on the dataset, or use the provenance graph to learn how the dataset was created. The data and software published in the repository reflect the evolving nature of research; anyone can publish new versions with the provenance documenting the process. Our open-source software platforms used in production, adhere to FAIR principles, and provide the basis for the two capabilities: GUIDs and Cloud Dataverse enabling the use cases above. We will expand upon them, produce new tools, and reach a wider community. Currently GUIDs and provenance describe datasets; we will generalize these mechanisms to support other digital objects, focusing on software in the pilot phase. We will connect and harmonize DataCite, identifiers.org, and N2T/EZID services to provide GUIDs; and integrate the Dataverse repository software with the Massachusetts Open Cloud, built on top of the OpenStack cloud platform, and public commercial clouds (Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud) to provide Cloud Dataverse. Our past experience producing sustainable services for overlapping communities of developers and users demonstrates our ability to apply our expertise to supporting the larger and more diverse NIH Data Commons user community.

"Applying Novel Passive Sensing Technology to Target Adherence to Diet in Behavioral Obesity Treatment for Patients with Cardiovascular Disease Risk Project Summary This National Research Service Award (F32) is designed to promote the development of Stephanie Goldstein as an independent, clinical research scientist focused on developing and evaluating strategies for measuring and intervening on health behaviors that capitalize on digital health technology. Behavioral obesity treatment (BOT) produces clinically significant weight loss and health benefits for many individuals with overweight/obesity and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Yet, about half of patients fall short of expected outcomes and most experience gradual weight regain, thus negating the benefits over time. Lapses (i.e., self- reported eating instances that deviate from the BOT prescribed diet) could explain poor outcomes, but the behavior is understudied because it is difficult to assess in-lab and via self-report. We therefore propose to study lapses using a multimethod approach with the following tools: ecological momentary assessment (EMA; repeated sampling method via mobile device), a wrist-worn device that automatically detects eating behavior and various eating characteristics (frequency, rate, and duration of eating episodes), and 24-hour dietary recalls. We will recruit participants (n=40) with overweight/obesity and one additional CVD risk factor to enroll in a 12-week BOT program and follow them through an additional 12-week period of weight loss maintenance. Participants will complete a biweekly 7-day EMA protocol to self-report on eating behavior, including the occurrence of dietary lapse. Participants will continuously wear the wrist-worn ActiGraph Link to characterize eating behavior. Lastly, participants will complete 24-hour dietary recalls via structured interview (split between days with and without lapses) at 6-week intervals to measure the composition of all food and beverages consumed. The proposed study approach is consistent with priorities of NHLBI to optimize clinical research and diagnostic strategies to improve CVD and related risk factors. This project will be conducted in combination with an individualized training program including a curriculum designed to facilitate the acquisition of key skills and experience to move the applicant towards her career goals. This includes didactic and experiential training related to the use of passive sensing technology and related analytic strategies in research, factors that can impede weight maintenance and dietary adherence in BOT, and administration and interpretation of validated nutritional assessment. The applicant will work closely with her primary sponsor, Dr. J. Graham Thomas, her co-sponsors Dr. Rena Wing (renowned expert in weight maintenance), Dr. Adam Hoover (electrical and computer scientist), and Dr. Whitney Evans (nutritional epidemiologist and registered dietician). This mentorship team, in combination with the infrastructure and resources available through the Miriam Hospital Weight Control and Diabetes Research Center and Alpert Brown Medical School, represent the ideal environment to accomplish the applicant's training goals, foster professional development and increase the applicant's autonomy as an independent clinical obesity researcher. Project Narrative The current project is evaluating the utility of a wrist-worn passive sensing device for detecting dietary lapses (i.e., discrete eating instances that deviate from a prescribed diet) and evaluating the behavior's association with weight loss outcomes. Participants, with overweight/obesity and one additional CVD risk factor, will wear wrist-worn devices, complete ecological momentary assessment (EMA; repeated sampling method via mobile device) on dietary lapses, and provide information on dietary composition via semi-regular 24-hour food recalls throughout the duration of a 12-week behavioral weight loss program and 12-week weight maintenance period. This study aims to 1) identifying characteristics of lapse behavior by measuring passively-sensed timing, duration, frequency, and rate of eating amongst known lapse episodes, 2) test the association between dietary lapse frequency and weight change, and 3) estimate nutrition composition of dietary lapses.",Applying Novel Passive Sensing Technology to Target Adherence to Diet in Behavioral Obesity Treatment for Patients with Cardiovascular Disease Risk,9609565,F32HL143954,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Algorithms ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavioral Medicine ', ' Beverages ', ' Body Weight Changes ', ' Weight Change ', ' Energy Intake ', ' caloric dietary content ', ' Caloric Intake ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Computers ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' lesson plans ', ' Curriculum ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Dietetics ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Hospitals ', ' Interview ', ' Laboratories ', ' Maintenance ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Moods ', ' Motion ', ' nutrition ', ' Nutrition Assessment ', ' Nutritional Assessment ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Patients ', ' Periodicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Sleep ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Programs ', ' Body Weight decreased ', ' wt-loss ', ' body weight loss ', ' Weight Reduction ', ' Weight Loss ', ' Weight ', ' Wing ', ' Work ', ' Wrist ', ' Measures ', ' falls ', ' Diet Habits ', ' eating habit ', ' Dietary Habits ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Specialist ', ' base ', ' career ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Mouth ', ' Cavitas Oris ', ' Buccal Cavity Head and Neck ', ' Buccal Cavity ', ' Oral cavity ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Measurement ', ' participant recruitment ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' Funding ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Scientist ', ' Hour ', ' Frequencies ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Pattern ', ' Overweight ', ' Over weight ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' treatment program ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Health Technology ', ' Health Care Technology ', ' Dietary Assessment ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Weight maintenance regimen ', ' weight management ', ' weight control ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' Dietary intake ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' National Research Service Awards ', ' NRSA ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' nutritious ', ' Nutritional ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' NHLBI ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' weight maintenance ', ' obesity treatment ', ' digital ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' willingness ', ' Outcome ', ' Eating Behavior ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinically significant ', ' mobile device ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' mobile health ', ' m-Health ', ' mHealth ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' training opportunity ', ' Healthy Eating ', ' clinical diagnostics ', ' sensing technology ', ' sensor technology ', ' weight loss programming ', ' weight loss program ', ' real time monitoring ', ' ']",NHLBI,MIRIAM HOSPITAL,F32,2018,58282,RI-01,-0.0402949061602346
"A Customizable Real-Time Biosensor for Continuous Monitoring of Water Contaminants Ensuring access to clean water for generations to come will involve developing novel ap- proaches to determining the safety and composition of potable water that are practical and afford- able. Arsenic, mercury, and cadmium are three of the top priorities among hazardous substances commonly found at Superfund sites, as they are linked to health problems in people exposed to them in drinking water, yet the current real-time monitoring methods for these and other contam- inants are either extremely costly or nonexistent, making it difﬁcult to monitor water quality with high spatial or temporal resolution. QBiSci is developing a biosensor that uses synthetic micro- bial sensor strains that ﬂuoresce in response to speciﬁc toxins to continuously monitor water for contamination. The platform will substantially improve upon currently available technologies for toxin detection, making monitoring more affordable, continuous, and ﬁeld-deployable. Speciﬁc Aim 1: To fully characterize three synthetic E. coli strains that speciﬁcally detect ar- senic, mercury, and cadmium in a continuous water stream. For a real-time sensor to be maxi- mally effective, it must be able to report accurate toxin concentrations in real-time. Focusing on three of the highest priority contaminants as a proof of feasibility, comprehensive data will be acquired to train a machine learning algorithm to be able classify real-world samples in real-time. Speciﬁc Aim 2: To develop and train a classiﬁcation algorithm to recognize the type and amount of each contaminant present in a continuous water stream. The ability to analyze and interpret data in real-time from a constantly ﬂuctuating water source will require an extensive classiﬁcation train- ing effort. QBiSci's existing machine learning framework will be trained and tested using many contamination induction scenarios, ranging from sudden pulses to subtly varying concentrations. Speciﬁc Aim 3: To develop a microﬂuidic cartridge system that reduces device complexity and enables sensor deployment with minimal intervention. QBiSci will develop a swappable car- tridge system using devices that are pre-loaded with biologically-stable strains and can simply be “plugged in” to the sensor platform to achieve repeatable results in a user-friendly manner. The development of a method for thermoplastic device fabrication will enable the more precise connections required for a cartridge clamping system that will require little operational expertise.  A successful outcome of this proposal will lead to a biosensor capable of real-time quantiﬁca- tion of arsenic, mercury, and cadmium in a continuous water input. A future Phase II proposal would focus on real-world performance evaluations of our sensors via deployment in areas of con- cern and comparison of our results to standard techniques as well as an expansion of the platform to detect other contaminants quantitatively and continuously. 1 Access to clean, reliable water supplies is critical to our quality of life and our economy, yet across the country over 100,000 hazardous waste sites are so heavily contaminated that the un- derlying groundwater doesn't meet drinking water standards. While there is a wide range of toxins found at these sites, arsenic, mercury, and cadmium are among the most common offend- ers, all of which have been linked to a variety of health problems ranging from cancer to dia- betes as well as behavior and neurological disorders. We are developing a customizable real-time biosensor that will enable contamination monitoring to become more affordable, continuous, and ﬁeld-deployable and will facilitate improved management decisions aimed at reducing toxin con- centrations in the environment, tracking the progression of contamination plums, and targeting investments in remediation efforts. 1",A Customizable Real-Time Biosensor for Continuous Monitoring of Water Contaminants,9467134,R43ES028993,"['Algorithms ', ' Arsenic ', ' Behavior Disorders ', ' behavioral disorder ', ' Cadmium ', ' Cd element ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Environment ', ' Escherichia coli ', ' E. coli ', ' E coli ', ' Fluorescence ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Hazardous Substances ', ' Hazardous Materials ', ' Health ', ' Investments ', ' Mercury ', ' Hg element ', ' Methods ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Toxin ', ' Water ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Water Supply ', ' Generations ', ' Hazardous Waste Sites ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Exposure to ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Pulse ', ' Stream ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' Closure by clamp ', ' Clampings ', ' ground water ', ' groundwater ', ' Performance ', ' water quality ', ' drinking water ', ' microbial ', ' Biosensor ', ' biological sensor ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' superfund site ', ' Plum ', ' Microfluidics ', ' Microfluidic ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Monitor ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cost ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' remediation ', ' Outcome ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Plug-in ', ' user-friendly ', ' operation ', ' time measurement ', ' temporal resolution ', ' temporal measurement ', ' Water contamination ', ' contaminated water ', ' real time monitoring ', ' ']",NIEHS,"QUANTITATIVE BIOSCIENCES, INC.",R43,2018,162205,CA-52,0.018647083040327105
"Individualized Signal Processing Strategy :Phase II This project describes a novel approach to automate and individualize the signal processing strategy for hearing aids (HA) that can result in improved speech intelligibility in background noise, greater user satisfaction and acceptance for HAs, and reduce barriers to affordable hearing health care. The proposed Individualized Signal Processing Strategy (ISPS) is based on individual performance on categorical perception tasks for speech stimuli. This differs from traditional methods based on sophisticated gain models built upon average perception, performance, and preference data. The ability to determine one’s ISPS automatically, rapidly and remotely can result in dramatic cost-savings and greater accessibility to hearing health care for patients who cannot afford it or for those who lack easy access to the necessary expertise. These technical achievements have the potential to radically change HA service delivery models yet can be implemented within existing business models and in concert with current practitioners. The ISPS method effectively replaces target-based HA fitting (e.g. NAL-NL2) with individualized speech-based parameter adjustment. The proposed work follows successful completion of our pilot project and builds upon the research team’s prior research on novel fitting methods for cochlear implant (CI) devices recently acquired by Cochlear, Ltd. Following the successful implementation of ISPS and integration with commercial HA software in the pilot study, we demonstrated feasibility including a field study in which performance outcomes for the ISPS method were as good as a conventional HA fitting method and only took a fraction of the time, despite ISPS having no prior knowledge of patient characteristics and no audiogram. Successful maturation and commercialization of the ISPS technology in Phase II will address several barriers identified in the previous RFA-DC-12-004 including physical, infrastructure, and knowledge barriers (by allowing remote or self-fitting HAs), economic barriers (by reducing overall costs), and cultural barriers (by providing easy access to HA fitting for patients who tend to avoid professional help). This Phase II project will develop an operational ISPS method by (1) integrating ISPS with hardware/software systems of our industry partners, (2) refine and enhance the ISPS method to improve efficiency and effectiveness of fitting hearing instruments, (3) build support for the use of ISPS in multiple marketplaces, and (4) evaluate the technology through field trials in different service delivery environments by comparing outcomes with ISPS fitting to those achieved with traditional prescriptive gain fitting within the same subjects. Following successful demonstration of these objectives, a Phase III project will focus on the transition of the technology to support remote and self-fitting of hearing instruments. This project seeks to develop, implement and test a novel automated method for fitting hearing aids based on real-time speech perception performance. This automated approach can improve hearing aid success while significant reducing costs of hearing health care. The automation of the fitting procedure can dramatically increase accessibility of hearing health care.",Individualized Signal Processing Strategy :Phase II,9472306,R44DC016249,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Audiology ', ' Audiometry ', ' Audiometric Test ', ' Audiogram ', ' Automation ', ' Cochlear Implants ', ' Cochlear Prosthesis ', ' Auditory Prosthesis ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Hearing ', ' sound perception ', ' hearing perception ', ' Hearing Aids ', ' Sensorineural Hearing Loss ', ' Sensory Hearing Loss ', ' Sensorineural Deafness ', ' implantable device ', ' indwelling device ', ' implant device ', ' biomedical implant ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Research ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' sound ', ' Speech ', ' Speech Intelligibility ', ' Speech Intelligibilities ', ' Speech Perception ', ' Supervision ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' United States Department of Veterans Affairs ', ' Veterans Administration ', ' United States Veterans Administration ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Generic Drugs ', ' generic ', ' Nonproprietary Drugs ', ' Cost Savings ', ' Businesses ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' satisfaction ', ' Cross-Over Designs ', ' Crossover Design ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' instrument ', ' Knowledge ', ' Frequencies ', ' Auditory ', ' meetings ', ' preference ', ' field study ', ' field test ', ' field learning ', ' field based data ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' knowledge base ', ' knowledgebase ', ' novel ', ' Categories ', ' Devices ', ' Modeling ', ' Manufacturer Name ', ' Manufacturer ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' NIDCD ', ' National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders ', ' Instruction ', ' cost ', ' modeling of the data ', ' model the data ', ' model of data ', ' data modeling ', ' software systems ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' inclusion criteria ', ' commercialization ', ' industry partnership ', ' industrial partnership ', ' industry partner ', ' signal processing ', ' graph theory ', ' improved outcome ', ' healthcare service ', ' health care service ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' healthcare delivery model ', ' care delivery model ', ' Service model ', ' Service delivery model ', ' service delivery ', ' ']",NIDCD,"SECURBORATION, INC.",R44,2018,732079,FL-08,-0.06809394451487238
"BRAIN INITIATIVE RESOURCE: DEVELOPMENT OF A HUMAN NEUROELECTROMAGNETIC DATA ARCHIVE AND TOOLS RESOURCE (NEMAR) To take advantage of recent and ongoing advances in intensive and large-scale computational methods, and to preserve the scientific data created by publicly funded research projects, data archives must be created as well as standards for specifying, identifying, and annotating deposited data. The value of and interest in such archives among researchers can be greatly increased by adding to them an active computational capability and framework of analysis and search tools that support further analysis as well as larger scale meta-analysis and large scale data mining. The OpenNeuro.org archive, begun as a repository for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, is such an archive. We propose to build a gateway to OpenNeuro for human electrophysiology data (EEG and MEG, as well as intracranial data recorded from clinical patients to plan brain surgeries or other therapies) – herein we refer to these modalities as neuroelectromagnetic (NEM) data. The Neuroelectromagnetic Data Archive and Tools Resource (NEMAR) at the San Diego Supercomputer Center will act as a gateway to OpenNeuro for NEM data research. Such data uploaded to NEMAR at SDSC will be deposited in the OpenNeuro archive. Still- private NEM data in OpenNeuro will, on user request, be copied to the NEMAR gateway for further user processing using the XSEDE high-performance resources at SDSC in conjunction with The Neuroscience Gateway (nsgportal.org), a freely available and easy to use portal to use of high-performance computing resources for neuroscience research. Publicly available OpenNeuro NEM data will be able to be analyzed by running verified analysis applications on the OpenNeuro system. In this project we will build an application to evaluate the quality of uploaded NEM data, and another to visualize the data, for EEG and MEG at both the scalp and brain source levels, including time-domain and frequency-domain dynamics time locked to sets of experimental events learned from the BIDS- and HED-formatted data annotations. The NEMAR gateway will take a major step toward applying machine learning methods to a large store of carefully collected and stored human electrophysiologic brain data to spur new developments in basic and clinical brain research. The NEMAR gateway to the OpenNeuro.org human neuroimaging data archive will build tools to add human electrical and magnetic brain activity records to the archive, to evaluate its quality for users and visualize its features. The resulting facility will allow applications of new machine learning methods to research on human brain dynamics that can be expected to lead to breakthroughs in understanding how the human brain supports our awareness and behavior in both health and disease.",BRAIN INITIATIVE RESOURCE: DEVELOPMENT OF A HUMAN NEUROELECTROMAGNETIC DATA ARCHIVE AND TOOLS RESOURCE (NEMAR),9795341,R24MH120037,"['Archives ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Communities ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Laboratories ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Libraries ', ' magnetoencephalographic imaging ', ' MEG imaging ', ' Magnetoencephalography ', ' Methods ', ' Mining ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Patients ', ' Privatization ', ' Quality Control ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Running ', ' Scalp ', ' Scalp structure ', ' Science ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' brain surgery ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Clinical ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Evaluation ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Data Quality ', ' Data Storage and Retrieval ', ' data storage ', ' data retrieval ', ' Funding ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Internet ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Descriptor ', ' Spottings ', ' Staging ', ' Deposition ', ' Deposit ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Frequencies ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' Magnetism ', ' magnetic ', ' Performance ', ' supercomputer ', ' High Performance Computing ', ' high-end computing ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' Modality ', ' response ', ' repository ', ' Magnetic Resonance ', ' Documentation ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' data processing ', ' computerized data processing ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' Base of the Brain ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Resource Development ', ' Neurosciences Research ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' web services ', ' web-based service ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' cyber infrastructure ', ' cyberinfrastructure ', ' Visualization software ', ' visualization tool ', ' computing resources ', ' computational resources ', ' data structure ', ' web interface ', ' brain research ', ' tool development ', ' data format ', ' Cloud Computing ', ' cloud computer ', ' Cloud Infrastructure ', ' BRAIN initiative ', ' built environment ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' support tools ', ' hackathon ', ' hackfest ', ' hack day ', ' data archive ', ' preservation ', ' data submission ', ' data deposition ', ' Infrastructure ', ' computational platform ', ' computing platform ', ' ']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R24,2019,926107,CA-52,0.007478729699320322
"Inferential methods for functional data from wearable devices Project Summary/Abstract This is a project to develop new statistical methods for comparing groups of subjects in terms of health outcomes that are assessed using data from wearable devices. Inexpensive wearable sensors for health monitoring are now capable of generating massive amounts of data collected longitudinally, up to months at a time. The project will develop inferential methods that can deal with the complexity of such data. A serious challenge is the presence of unmeasured time-dependent confounders (e.g., circadian and dietary patterns), making direct comparisons or borrowing strength across subjects untenable unless the studies are carried out in controlled experimental con- ditions. Generic data mining and machine learning tools have been widely used to provide predictions of health status from such data. However, such tools cannot be used for signiﬁcance testing of covariate effects, which is necessary for designing precision medicine interventions, for example, without taking the inherent model selection or the presence of the unmeasured confounders into account. To overcome these difﬁculties, a systematic de- velopment of inferential methods for functional outcome data obtained from wearable devices will be carried out. There are three speciﬁc aims: 1) Develop metrics for functional outcome data from wearable devices, 2) Develop nonparametric estimation and testing methods for activity proﬁles and a screening method for predictors of activity proﬁles, 3) Implement the methods in an R package and carry out two case studies using accelerometer data. For Aim 1, the approach is to reduce the sensor data to occupation time proﬁles (e.g., as a function of activity level), and formulate the statistical modeling in terms of these proﬁles using survival and functional data analytic meth- ods. This will have a number of advantages, the principal one being that time-dependent confounders become less problematic because the effect of differences in temporal alignment across subjects is mitigated. In addition, survival analysis methods can be applied by viewing the occupation time as a time-to-event outcome indexed by activity level. For Aim 2, nonparametric methods will be used to compare and order occupation time distributions between groups of subjects that are speciﬁed in terms of baseline covariate levels or treatment groups. Further, a new method of post-selection inference based on marginal screening for function-on-scalar regression will be developed to identify and formally test whether covariates are signiﬁcantly associated with activity proﬁles. Aim 3 will develop an R-package implementation, and as a test-bed for the proposed methods they will be applied to two Columbia-based clinical studies: to the study of physical activity in children enrolled in New York City Head Start, and to the study of experimental drugs for the treatment of mitochondrial depletion syndrome. Project Narrative The relevance of the project to public health is that it will develop statistical methods for the physiological eval- uation of patients on the basis of data collected by inexpensive wearable sensors (e.g., accelerometers). By introducing methods for the rigorous comparison of healthcare status among groups of patients observed longi- tudinally over time using such devices, treatment decisions that can beneﬁt targeted populations of patients in terms of continuously-assessed health outcomes will become possible.",Inferential methods for functional data from wearable devices,9658873,R01AG062401,"['Acceleration ', ' Beds ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' preschool child (1-5) ', ' 1-5 years old ', ' Preschool Child ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Drug Combinations ', ' drug treatment ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' indexing ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Methods ', ' mitochondrial ', ' Mitochondria ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Motivation ', ' New York City ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Occupations ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' stochastic method ', ' Stochastic Processes ', ' Survival Analyses ', ' Survival Analysis ', ' Syndrome ', ' Target Populations ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' case report ', ' Case Study ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Evaluation ', ' Physical activity ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Event ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' Head Start Program ', ' Head Start ', ' Proxy ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Bypass ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' Data ', ' Dietary Practices ', ' dietary pattern ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' time use ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Outcome ', ' patient population ', ' Regimen ', ' screening ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' treatment group ', ' Data Analytics ', ' Accelerometer ', ' activity tracker ', ' activity monitor ', ' accelerometry ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' lower income families ', ' wearable device ', ' wearable sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' body sensor ', ' circadian ', ' ']",NIA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,317858,NY-13,0.010563908184539885
"Customized Health Alerts and Consumer-Centered Interfaces Using In-Home and Wearable Sensors In-home sensing technologies hold enormous potential for early detection of health changes that can dramatically affect the experiences of aging: enabling functional independence, improving self-management of chronic or acute conditions, and improving quality of life. Chronic diseases especially affect older adults. Problems in chronic disease management are often the cause of losing independence for aging Americans. In 2012, 1 in 2 American adults (117 million) had at least one chronic condition, and 26% of the population had multiple chronic conditions, accounting for 84% of US health care costs. Early illness recognition and early treatment is key to improving health status with rapid recovery after an exacerbation of a chronic illness or acute illness, and also key to reducing morbidity and mortality in older adults and controlling health care costs.  In previous work, the team developed a health alert system that captures and analyzes data from sensors embedded in the home. Sensor data are captured passively and continuously in the home. In a pilot NIH R21 study, significant differences in health outcomes were shown with health alerts from motion and bed sensor data, based on bed restlessness and low, normal, and high pulse and respiration rates. The system actually detected changes in chronic diseases or acute illnesses on average 10 days to 2 weeks before usual assessment methods or self-reports of illness. For this project, the team will expand from the clinician-focused system to a consumer-focused system by incorporating more finely grained sensing (gait and quantitative pulse and respiration), with new improved algorithms that integrate individual health status and medication use, and track trajectories of health changes, for more sensitive, and more personalized health alerts with fewer false alarms. A recently developed bed sensor will be incorporated to passively capture quantitative pulse, respiration, and restlessness while the subject is resting. Gait parameters (e.g., in-home walking speed, stride time and stride length) will also be captured using depth images that show shadowy silhouettes. In addition, the team will solicit the consumer perspective on customized health alerts and a user interface for displaying sensor and alert information. The views of seniors and their family members will be used to inform the development of the new customized alert algorithms and drive the development of a consumer-focused interface that will provide empowering tools for self-management of chronic illnesses. In addition, the use of commercially available wrist-worn sensors will be explored for the purpose of recognizing health changes. The study will include a retrospective analysis of sensor data collected in 13 senior housing sites in Missouri. New participants will be recruited in 5 senior housing sites in Columbia, MO to investigate the consumer perspective. The important process of engaging consumers in this work is the next step in translating these systems into clinical practice for self-managing chronic health conditions, supporting seniors living independently. PROJECT NARRATIVE We will build on our current work using intelligent, in-home sensor systems with automated health alerts to investigate new health alert algorithms that are more sensitive and more customized to the individual. These will be tested with data from 13 senior housing sites in Missouri using clinician feedback and actual health trajectories for evaluation.

"SCH: Personalized Depression Treatment Support by Mobile Sensor Analytics  The current best practice guidelines for treating depression call for close monitoring of patients, and periodically adjusting treatment as needed. This project will advance personalized depression treatment by developing an innovative system, DepWatch, that leverages mobile health technologies and machine learning tools to provide clinicians objective, accurate, and timely assessment of depression symptoms to assist with their clinical decision making process. Specifically, DepWatch collects sensory data passively from smartphones and wristbands, without any user interaction, and uses simple user-friendly interfaces to collect ecological momentary assessments (EMA), medication adherence and safety related data from patients. The collected data will be fed to machine learning models to be developed in the project to provide weekly assessment of patient symptom levels and predict the trajectory of treatment response over time. The assessment and prediction results are then presented using a graphic interface to clinicians to help them make critical treatment decisions. Our project comprises two studies. Phase I collects sensory data and other data (e.g., clinical data, EMA, tolerability and safety data) from 250 adult participants with unstable depression symptomatology. The data thus collected will be used to develop and validate assessment and prediction models, which will be incorporated into DepWatch system. In Phase II, three clinicians will use DepWatch to support their clinical decision making process; a total of 50 participants under treatment by the three participating clinicians will be recruited for the study. A number of innovative machine learning techniques will be developed. These include a set of new learning formulations to construct matrix-based longitudinal predictive models, and determine the temporal contingency and the most influential features, and deep learning based data imputation methods that can handle both problems of sporadic missing data as well as missing data in an entire view. In addition, multi-task feature learning models and feature selection techniques will be expanded and refined for this challenging setting of large-scale heterogeneous data. The project is highly relevant to public and global health because it will provide a significant step forward in providing effective and patient-centric care in treating depression. It will help personalize depression treatment by identifying patients who are failing treatments early and will assist providers to take necessary actions before patients drop out of treatment.",SCH: Personalized Depression Treatment Support by Mobile Sensor Analytics ,9758034,R01MH119678,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Algorithms ', ' Communities ', ' Data Sources ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Family ', ' Influentials ', ' Learning ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Noise ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Public Health ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Safety ', ' Self-Administered ', ' Self Administration ', ' Sleep ', ' Time ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Caring ', ' Practice Guidelines ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Sensory ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Health Technology ', ' Healthcare Technology ', ' Health Care Technology ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Drops ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Provider ', ' global health ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Prediction of Response to Therapy ', ' treatment response prediction ', ' treatment prediction ', ' therapy prediction ', ' predict treatment response ', ' predict therapy response ', ' predict therapeutic response ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Process ', ' medication compliance ', ' medication adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' user-friendly ', ' multitask ', ' multi-task ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' treatment response ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' mHealth ', ' mobile health ', ' m-Health ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' Formulation ', ' symptomatology ', ' recruit ', ' deep learning ', ' autoencoder ', ' autoencoding neural network ', ' denoising ', ' de-noising ', ' medication safety ', ' pharmaceutical safety ', ' drug safety ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,R01,2019,292411,CT-02,-0.01959156740908005
"Cell line identification with DNA replication timing fingerprints Project Summary Cultured cell lines have been widely used for basic research to study cell function, as models for disease, and for drug screening. Correct identification of the cell lines used is necessary to make the right scientific conclusions and replicate experiments. Cell lines in culture can be contaminated by foreign cells, which may rapidly displace the original cells. The routine verification of the identity of cultured cells should be performed, but a majority of laboratories do not monitor the identity of their cell lines, and many cell lines are misidentified. Analyses of cells submitted to major repositories such as the DSMZ (Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen) and the ATCC (American Type Culture Collection) have found that 15-40% of cell lines submitted by investigators are misidentified. The costs, effort, and time required to confirm the identity of cell lines have been a barrier to adoption of cell line identification as a routine quality control measure. Current technologies for identifying cultured cells are limited, and their cost is a barrier for small scale use. In this SBIR phase I application, we aim to develop a novel tool for cell line and cell type identification using DNA replication timing (RT) fingerprints, which are RT values at specific genomic regions. In our previous studies, we have discovered that DNA RT was highly specific to different cell lines and cell types and this specificity can be exploited for the purpose of cell line/type identification (PLoS Comp Biol, 2011; Genome Research, 2010; Genome Research 2015). A patent for RT fingerprint identification and use has been issued in 2016. Recently, we have applied this technology to identify common markers between distinct progeroid diseases (PNAS, 2017). A novel segmentation method, called iSeg, for segmenting genomic and epigenomic data has also been developed in our lab (BMC Bioinformatics, In Press), which can be used to further improve the identification of RT fingerprints. We propose to collect a large number of DNA RT profiles for a diverse set of cell lines and cell types and develop RT fingerprints for their identification. A web server will be built to take users’ input of RT data and output the cell line best matched with the input data. The web server can also take data of new cell lines from users to allow continually developing our models and database. RT fingerprints can be measured cost-effectively using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) experiment. Since the total cost for obtaining RT fingerprint for one sample is around $100, which can be further reduced when scaled up, our method makes it possible to routinely check the identity of cultured cells.

"Towards a comprehensive multiscale 3D human interactome network PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Almost all proteins function through interacting with other proteins. On average, a protein interacts with ~5 other protein partners in the current human interactome. Therefore, it is of great importance to accurately determine the interface of each interaction, in order to understand how each protein works with different partners to carry out different functions. In our previous Nature Biotechnology study, we implemented a proteome-scale homology modeling approach to generate the first 3D human structural interactome: the interface for each interaction in this network was determined at atomic resolution through co-crystal structures and homology models. Using our 3D interactome, we found that, among >1,800 known disease genes associated with two or more clinically distinctly disorders, pairs of mutations on the same gene but in different interfaces with different partners are significantly more likely to cause distinct diseases. However, only 4,150 human protein interactions have co-crystal structures and 2,921 have high-quality homology models. ~50,000 interactions (87% of the current human interactome) are not amenable to current structural modeling methods. Here, we propose to develop a big-data-driven machine-learning approach integrating biophysiochemical, evolutionary, structural, and population genetic features to identify interaction- specific interfaces for the whole human interactome. Because several key features are unavailable for many proteins and interactions, we propose an innovative approach to use an ensemble of random forest classifiers, named Ensemble Protein Interface Classifier (EPIC), to address this large-scale non-random missing data problem (Aim 1). The high throughput of our massively parallel Clone-seq and INtegrated PrOtein INteractome perTurbation screening (InPOINT) pipeline! uniquely enables us to perform real-time experimental parameter optimization (in Years 2-4 we will clone ~1,500 mutations and examine their impact on ~2,500 interactions every year to iteratively evaluate and refine EPIC; Aim 2). Finally, we will construct a comprehensive multiscale 3D interactome for all known human protein-protein interactions: we will collect/generate atomic- resolution structural models for interactions whenever possible (co-crystal structures and homology models); we will accurately determine interaction-specific interface residues and domains for the whole human interactome. We will deploy an interactive web portal to disseminate our results and allow functional genomic inference in the context of our structural interactome (Aim 3). Our comprehensive multiscale 3D human interactome and the accompanying web portal will greatly reduce the barrier-to-entry for performing systematic structural analysis on a large number of proteins and their interactions, and open the flood gates for such analyses in genomic studies. NARRATIVE Almost all proteins function through interacting with other proteins and the structural details of these interaction interfaces are key in understanding protein function. However, the interfaces for vast majority of human protein interactions are currently unknown. Here, we propose to establish an innovative ensemble classifier approach and implement an unprecedented large-scale computational-experimental iterative learning scheme to predict interfaces for the whole human interactome, in anticipation that our predicted interfaces will help dissect functional sites of disease mutations and be useful for rational drug design to target these sites.",Towards a comprehensive multiscale 3D human interactome network,9731549,R01GM124559,"['Biotechnology ', ' Biotech ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Crystallization ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Drug Design ', ' Evolution ', ' Flooding ', ' Floods ', ' Genes ', ' Population Genetics ', ' Goals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Study models ', ' Structural Models ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' Names ', ' Proteins ', ' Publishing ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Individual ', ' Letters ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' 3D ', ' 3-D ', ' Missense Mutation ', ' Structure ', ' Graph ', ' Proteome ', ' Modeling ', ' protein protein interaction ', ' functional genomics ', ' Genomics ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Address ', ' protein structure ', ' Data ', ' Homology Modeling ', ' Resolution ', ' Scheme ', ' Molecular ', ' Docking ', ' protein function ', ' three dimensional structure ', ' 3D structure ', ' 3-dimensional structure ', ' 3-D structure ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' biological research ', ' user-friendly ', ' web-accessible ', ' screening ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' web portal ', ' internet portal ', ' human interactome ', ' random forest ', ' ']",NIGMS,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,384166,NY-23,-0.04177698725547273
"I-Corps Program Application for Market Assessment of Non-invasive Imaging Device to Improve Outcomes of Amputations Surgery in Critical Limb Ischemia. 1. Executive Summary Nearly 150,000 patients in the US undergo lower extremity amputations annually secondary to peripheral arterial disease (PAD) complicated by critical limb ischemia (CLI).1,2,3 To increase a patient’s post-operative quality of life, surgeons attempt to salvage as much limb tissue as possible while also considering the likelihood of primary wound healing at a given level of amputation (LOA).4 The principal challenge in this decision is that surgeons overestimate the likelihood of healing at the selected LOA. Therefore, in the first year, 10% to 35% of amputations eventually require re-amputation to a more proximal level.5-7 This additional treatment prolongs the patient’s return to walking, worsening their condition and deteriorating their mental health. The burden to the healthcare system is immense. The average cost for each amputation is over $70,000, as evidenced by a recent publication that shows diabetic foot ulcer complications, mainly attributed to amputation, cost more than the five most costly forms of cancer.8 Despite these facts, there are no objective studies for selection of LOA in patients with PAD. To address this critical problem, Spectral MD (SMD) has developed a point-of-care imaging device (DeepView), which simultaneously performs multispectral imaging (MSI) and Photoplethysmography (PPG) imaging across the visible and infrared spectrum to obtain a quantitative microvascular tissue assessment. These optical measurements are integrated using artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to provide a quantitative aid to the physician’s determination of tissue viability at a proposed amputation site. If used for routine assessment prior to amputation, SMD expects DeepView to reduce the rate of re- amputation by 70%, resulting in up to 38,000 fewer re-amputations per year while improving quality of life for amputees and reducing associated health costs. The central objective for SMD’s Phase I SBIR is to perform a feasibility clinical study to demonstrate the DeepView device will achieve greater than 90% accuracy in identifying the healing potential of tissue at the amputation site. This hypothesis will be tested by the following specific aims: Aim 1: Complete a Feasibility Study creating a database of pre-amputation images. This data will be used for construction of the AI algorithm to predict amputation site healing potential. Aim 2: Identify MSI and PPG features that can accurately predict amputation site healing potential. Aim 3: Using Aim I clinical data, finalize the AI algorithm architecture and estimate sample size needed for a Phase II Pivotal Study in which the necessary training data to achieve at least 90% sensitivity and 90% specificity will be obtained. As of this Supplement request, SMD has initiated a clinical study for feasibility and enrolled the first subject. Through collaboration with the clinical study site Principal Investigator (PI), Dr. Dennis Gable, SMD developed the protocol and trained his research staff at the study site, Baylor Medical Center Plano, in the use of the DeepView device. SMD anticipates enrollment of five subjects each month over the next 6 months. The I-Corps team will consist of the following members: Michael DiMaio, MD – Role: C-Level Corporate Officer. Dr. DiMaio, MD is Founder and Chief Executive Officer of SMD and has led SMD in obtaining over $30M in non-dilutive government funding and private investments. His distinguished career includes extensive experience as an entrepreneur, clinician, and scientist. With over 20 years’ experience as a cardiovascular surgeon, Dr. DiMaio has a widespread network of physicians and hospitals from which to draw contacts for customer interviews. Jeffrey Thatcher, PhD – Role: PI. Dr. Thatcher is the Chief Scientist at SMD and is a leader in the development of diagnostic imaging for soft tissue diseases. He led SMD in conceptualizing and inventing SMD’s core imaging technology undergoing clinical trials in three wound diagnostics applications including: burns; diabetic ulcers; and amputation. Wensheng Fan, MS – Role: Industry Expert. Wensheng Fan is Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer at SMD. He is an executive, entrepreneur, and innovator with over 20 years of experience in natural speech recognition and real time imaging systems. At SMD, he leads market engagement, strategic financial planning, and device development. Narrative In patients with peripheral arterial disease, reported rates of re-amputation due to non-healing of a primary amputation are very significant—approximately 20% of below-the-knee amputations require eventual revision, with even higher rates established for amputations at the level of the foot. There are no gold-standard tests for selection of level of amputation (LOA) to aid clinical judgment. To address this critical problem, SpectralMD is developing the DeepView-Gen2 imaging device that integrates multispectral imaging and a machine learning algorithm to quantitatively measure microvascular blood flow and tissue healing potential to assist in the clinical selection of LOA and minimize the incidence of re-amputation and its associated morbidity and mortality.",I-Corps Program Application for Market Assessment of Non-invasive Imaging Device to Improve Outcomes of Amputations Surgery in Critical Limb Ischemia.,9827388,R43HL142428,"['Algorithms ', ' Amputation ', ' Amputees ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Burn injury ', ' burned ', ' Burns ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Diagnostic Imaging ', ' Non-Trunk ', ' Limbs ', ' Extremities ', ' Limb structure ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' foot ', ' Gold ', ' Government ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Industry ', ' Interview ', ' Investments ', ' Ischemia ', ' Judgment ', ' Knee ', ' Membrum inferius ', ' Lower Limb ', ' Lower Extremity ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' optical ', ' Optics ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Postoperative ', ' Post-Operative ', ' Postoperative Period ', ' Privatization ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Specificity ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Wound Repair ', ' Wound Healing ', ' Measures ', ' Synthesis Phase ', ' Synthesis Period ', ' S Period ', ' S Phase ', ' Walking ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Photoplethysmography ', ' Photoreflexometry ', ' Photoreflexometries ', ' Light Reflection Rheography ', ' Secondary to ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Training ', ' Blood flow ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Measurement ', ' Sample Size ', ' Funding ', ' Soft Tissue Disorder ', ' Soft Tissue Disease ', ' Collaborations ', ' Diagnostic ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Medical center ', ' Surgeon ', ' experience ', ' speech recognition ', ' member ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Diabetic ulcer ', ' diabetes ulcer ', ' Address ', ' Tissue Viability ', ' Diabetic Foot Ulcer ', ' Data ', ' Device or Instrument Development ', ' instrument development ', ' device development ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Imaging Device ', ' Imaging Tool ', ' Imaging Instrument ', ' Research Training ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' SBIR ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' point of care ', ' Peripheral arterial disease ', ' peripheral artery disease ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' healing ', ' wound ', ' Imaging technology ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' non-invasive imaging ', ' noninvasive imaging ', ' imaging system ', ' Innovation Corps ', ' I-Corps ', ' improved outcome ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' real-time images ', ' realtime image ', ' ']",NHLBI,"SPECTRAL MD, INC.",R43,2019,54976,TX-30,-0.009382043102365466
"Applying Novel Passive Sensing Technology to Target Adherence to Diet in Behavioral Obesity Treatment for Patients with Cardiovascular Disease Risk Project Summary This National Research Service Award (F32) is designed to promote the development of Stephanie Goldstein as an independent, clinical research scientist focused on developing and evaluating strategies for measuring and intervening on health behaviors that capitalize on digital health technology. Behavioral obesity treatment (BOT) produces clinically significant weight loss and health benefits for many individuals with overweight/obesity and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Yet, about half of patients fall short of expected outcomes and most experience gradual weight regain, thus negating the benefits over time. Lapses (i.e., self- reported eating instances that deviate from the BOT prescribed diet) could explain poor outcomes, but the behavior is understudied because it is difficult to assess in-lab and via self-report. We therefore propose to study lapses using a multimethod approach with the following tools: ecological momentary assessment (EMA; repeated sampling method via mobile device), a wrist-worn device that automatically detects eating behavior and various eating characteristics (frequency, rate, and duration of eating episodes), and 24-hour dietary recalls. We will recruit participants (n=40) with overweight/obesity and one additional CVD risk factor to enroll in a 12-week BOT program and follow them through an additional 12-week period of weight loss maintenance. Participants will complete a biweekly 7-day EMA protocol to self-report on eating behavior, including the occurrence of dietary lapse. Participants will continuously wear the wrist-worn ActiGraph Link to characterize eating behavior. Lastly, participants will complete 24-hour dietary recalls via structured interview (split between days with and without lapses) at 6-week intervals to measure the composition of all food and beverages consumed. The proposed study approach is consistent with priorities of NHLBI to optimize clinical research and diagnostic strategies to improve CVD and related risk factors. This project will be conducted in combination with an individualized training program including a curriculum designed to facilitate the acquisition of key skills and experience to move the applicant towards her career goals. This includes didactic and experiential training related to the use of passive sensing technology and related analytic strategies in research, factors that can impede weight maintenance and dietary adherence in BOT, and administration and interpretation of validated nutritional assessment. The applicant will work closely with her primary sponsor, Dr. J. Graham Thomas, her co-sponsors Dr. Rena Wing (renowned expert in weight maintenance), Dr. Adam Hoover (electrical and computer scientist), and Dr. Whitney Evans (nutritional epidemiologist and registered dietician). This mentorship team, in combination with the infrastructure and resources available through the Miriam Hospital Weight Control and Diabetes Research Center and Alpert Brown Medical School, represent the ideal environment to accomplish the applicant's training goals, foster professional development and increase the applicant's autonomy as an independent clinical obesity researcher. Project Narrative The current project is evaluating the utility of a wrist-worn passive sensing device for detecting dietary lapses (i.e., discrete eating instances that deviate from a prescribed diet) and evaluating the behavior's association with weight loss outcomes. Participants, with overweight/obesity and one additional CVD risk factor, will wear wrist-worn devices, complete ecological momentary assessment (EMA; repeated sampling method via mobile device) on dietary lapses, and provide information on dietary composition via semi-regular 24-hour food recalls throughout the duration of a 12-week behavioral weight loss program and 12-week weight maintenance period. This study aims to 1) identifying characteristics of lapse behavior by measuring passively-sensed timing, duration, frequency, and rate of eating amongst known lapse episodes, 2) test the association between dietary lapse frequency and weight change, and 3) estimate nutrition composition of dietary lapses.",Applying Novel Passive Sensing Technology to Target Adherence to Diet in Behavioral Obesity Treatment for Patients with Cardiovascular Disease Risk,9771304,F32HL143954,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Algorithms ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavioral Medicine ', ' Beverages ', ' Body Weight Changes ', ' Weight Change ', ' Energy Intake ', ' caloric dietary content ', ' Caloric Intake ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Computers ', ' lesson plans ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Dietetics ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Hospitals ', ' Interview ', ' Laboratories ', ' Maintenance ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Moods ', ' Motion ', ' nutrition ', ' Nutritional Assessment ', ' Nutrition Assessment ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Patients ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Periodicity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Programs ', ' wt-loss ', ' body weight loss ', ' Weight Reduction ', ' Weight Loss ', ' Body Weight decreased ', ' Weight ', ' Wing ', ' Work ', ' Wrist ', ' Measures ', ' falls ', ' eating habit ', ' Dietary Habits ', ' Diet Habits ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Specialist ', ' base ', ' career ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Oral cavity ', ' Mouth ', ' Cavitas Oris ', ' Buccal Cavity Head and Neck ', ' Buccal Cavity ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Measurement ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' participant recruitment ', ' Funding ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Scientist ', ' Hour ', ' Frequencies ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Overweight ', ' Over weight ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' treatment program ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Health Technology ', ' Healthcare Technology ', ' Health Care Technology ', ' Dietary Assessment ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Weight maintenance regimen ', ' weight management ', ' weight control ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' actigraph ', ' actigraphy ', ' Dietary intake ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' National Research Service Awards ', ' NRSA ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' Nutritional ', ' nutritious ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' NHLBI ', ' food consumption ', ' weight maintenance ', ' obesity treatment ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' willingness ', ' Outcome ', ' Consumption ', ' Eating Behavior ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' mobile device ', ' mHealth ', ' mobile health ', ' m-Health ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' training opportunity ', ' Healthy Eating ', ' clinical diagnostics ', ' sensor technology ', ' sensing technology ', ' weight loss program ', ' weight loss programming ', ' real time monitoring ', ' realtime monitoring ', ' Infrastructure ', ' dietary adherence ', ' diet adherence ', ' adaptive intervention ', ' sleep pattern ', ' ']",NHLBI,MIRIAM HOSPITAL,F32,2019,60552,RI-01,-0.0402949061602346
"EPICA: Edge-based Precision Intensive Care Analytics Abstract Medical decision making in intensive care settings relies on complex biomedical information, collected in real time, to assist hospital staff in patient management and intervention decisions. In this context, machine learning (ML) applications applied to healthcare analytics have been shown to provide significant improvement in quality of care and overall efficiency in ICU operations. A number of challenges affect healthcare analytics, these are growing data sizes, increasingly heterogeneous data sources, data assurance, credibility and quality as well as the privacy of patient record interchange. Current approaches to healthcare analytics are predominantly reliant on desktop and cloud computing architectures. These traditional systems exhibit high-latency, high-power requirements, and are overall inefficient for advanced analytic applications. If we hope to leverage the benefits of growing data size and heterogeneity, a new hardware paradigm for real time, secure and reliable ML in the clinic is needed. A potential for great innovation in medical big data applications is to imbue more analytic capability into smaller devices that sit closer to the source of data. This so-called edge computing will be instrumental in future medical applications, where real-time, low-latency, low-power computational tools are likely to dramatically improve the feasibility of remote monitoring and intensive monitoring applications, ultimately improving health outcomes. Lucid Circuit, Inc. is developing a line of purpose-built edge-analytics processors called AstrumTM. AstrumTM is an energy-efficient runtime-adaptable processor for reliable high-performance computing and low-power applications. AstrumTM processors benefit from an adaptable compute fabric that combines runtime-reconfigurable architecture and in-silicon security features. AstrumTM processors are designed to supports evolving analytics algorithms. In this proposal, we seek to optimize state of the art ML algorithms for signal processing, data quality monitoring and safe data interchange in remote and intensive-monitoring medical applications at the edge using AstrumTM. In phase II, we seek to develop an analytics programming ecosystem within which developers can customize signal quality metrics and prediction rules at a high level of abstraction, using popular analytics programming platforms. Ultimately, the work proposed in this application will enable the development of a new generation of edge-based precision intensive care and mobile health devices, together with a programming toolkit for customization, tuning, and development of ML algorithms that best match the needs of researchers, patients, and healthcare providers. Project Narrative Machine Learning (ML) applications to medical big data, have been shown to provide improved quality of care in intensive care settings. Their implementation in the clinic is currently limited by reliance on obsolete desktop and cloud computing architectures.

"User-driven Retrospectively Supervised Classification Updating (RESCU) systemfor robust upper limb prosthesis control ABSTRACT Approximately 41,000 individuals live with upper-limb loss (loss of at least one hand) in the US. Fortunately, prosthetic devices have advanced considerably in the past decades with the development of dexterous, anthropomorphic hands. However, potentially the most promising used control strategy, myoelectric control, lacks a correspondingly high-level of performance and hence the use of dexterous hands remains highly limited. The need for a complete overhaul in upper limb prosthesis control is well highlighted by the abandonment rates of myoelectric devices, which can reach up to 40% in the case of trans-humeral amputees. The area of research that has received the most focus over the past decade has been “pattern recognition,” which is a signal processing based control method that uses multi-channel surface electromyography as the control input. While pattern recognition provides intuitive operation of multiple prosthetic degrees of freedom, it lacks robustness and requires frequent, often daily calibration. Thus, it has not yet achieved the desired clinical acceptance. Our team proposes clinical translation of a novel highly adaptive upper limb prosthesis control system that incorporates two major advances: 1) machine learning (robust classification by implementing a non-boundary based algorithm), and 2) training by retrospectively incorporating user data from activities of daily living (ADL). The proposed system will enable machine intelligence with user input for prosthesis control. Our work is organized as follows: Phase I: (a) First, we will implement a fundamentally new machine intelligence technique, Extreme Learning Machine with Adaptive Sparse Representation Classification (EASRC), that is more resilient to untrained noisy conditions that users may encounter in the real-world and requires less data than traditional myoelectric signal processing. (b) In parallel, we will implement an adaptive learning algorithm, Nessa, which allows users to relabel misclassified data recorded during use and then update the EASRC classifier to adapt to any major extrinsic or intrinsic changes in the signals. Taken together, EASRC and Nessa comprise the Retrospectively Supervised Classification Updating (RESCU) system. Once, the RESCU implementation is complete, we will optimize the system through a joint effort with Johns Hopkins University, and complete an iterative benchtop RESCU evaluation with a focus group of 3 amputee subjects and their prosthetists. Our milestones for Phase I are as follows:  Milestone 1.1: Extreme Learning Machine with Adaptively Sparse Representation (EASRC) algorithm  successfully implemented and verified  Milestone 1.2: Implementation of Nessa adaptive learning algorithm and smartwatch interface  Milestone 1.3: User Needs and Design Inputs locked as a result of Focus Group testing  Milestone 1.4: Hold a pre-submission meeting with FDA for feedback on device classification and  planned product performance testing  Milestone 1.5: Hold a Scientific Steering Group (SSG) meeting  Milestone 1.6: Convene a Study Monitoring Committee (SMC) and hold an initial meeting to review  clinical plans.  Milestone 1.7: Develop Clinical Study Protocol  Milestone 1.8: Register the study on www.clinicaltrials.gov. PROJECT NARRATIVE In this project, we aim to empower the user by bringing them into the control loop of their prosthesis and improve the stability of their control strategy over time. Specifically, we implement to a robust classifier, an adaptive learning algorithm, and a smartwatch interface, which allows the user to teach their device when it misunderstands the commands that the user is sending to control the prosthesis. This will result in improved control without cumbersome or time-consuming effort on the part of the user and, more importantly, we hope that it will give the user a greater sense of empowerment and ownership over their prosthesis.",User-driven Retrospectively Supervised Classification Updating (RESCU) systemfor robust upper limb prosthesis control,9779227,U44NS108894,"['Activities of Daily Living ', ' functional capacity ', ' functional ability ', ' daily living functionality ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' Algorithms ', ' Amputees ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Calibration ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Electromyography ', ' Feedback ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Liberty ', ' Freedom ', ' Group Meetings ', ' Hand ', ' Joints ', ' Methods ', ' Ownership ', ' Research ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Supervision ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Prosthesis ', ' Prosthetics ', ' Prosthetic device ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Surface ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Intuition ', ' Individual ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' meetings ', ' Performance ', ' novel ', ' empowerment ', ' Devices ', ' performance tests ', ' Upper Extremity ', ' Upper Limb ', ' Membrum superius ', ' Data ', ' Pattern Recognition ', ' Update ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Consumption ', ' operation ', ' signal processing ', ' prosthesis control ', ' prosthetic control ', ' myoelectric control ', ' adaptive learning ', ' clinical translation ', ' smart watch ', ' smartwatch ', ' learning algorithm ', ' ']",NINDS,"INFINITE BIOMEDICAL TECHNOLOGIES, LLC",U44,2019,79250,MD-07,0.050650856788800575
"Scalable Software for Distributed Processing and Visualization of Multi-Site MEG/EEG Datasets Project Summary During the past three decades non-invasive functional brain imaging has developed immensely in terms of measurement technologies, analysis methods, and innovative paradigms to capture information about brain function both in healthy and diseased individuals. Although functional MRI (fMRI) has become very useful, it only provides indirect information about neuronal activity through the neurovascular coupling with a limited temporal resolution. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) remain the only available noninvasive techniques capable of directly measuring the electrophysiological activity with a millisecond resolution. During the past eight years we have developed, with NIH support, the MNE-Python software, which covers multiple methods of data preprocessing, source localization, statistical analysis, and estimation of functional connectivity between distributed brain regions. All algorithms and utility functions are implemented in a consistent manner with well-documented interfaces, enabling users to create M/EEG data analysis pipelines by writing Python scripts. To further extend our software to meet the needs of a growing user base and reflect recent developments in the MEG/EEG field we will pursue three specific Aims. In Aim 1 we will: (i) Create an all-embracing suite of noise cancellation tools incorporating and extending methods present in different MEG systems; (ii) Implement device independent methods for head-movement determination and compensation on the basis of head movement data recorded during a MEG session; (iii) Develop methods for automatic tagging of artifacts using machine learning approaches. In Aim 2 our focus is to extend the software to make modern distributed computing resources easily usable in processing and to allow for remote visualization without the need to move large amounts of data across the network. Finally, in Aim 3, we will continue to develop MNE-Python using best programming practices ensuring multiplatform compatibility, extensive web-based documentation, training and forums, and hands-on training workshops. As a result of these developments the MNE-Python will be able to effectively process large number of subjects and huge amounts data ensuing and from multi-site studies harmoniously across different MEG/EEG systems. Narrative MEG and EEG can be used to understand and diagnose abnormalities underlying a wide range neurological and psychiatric illnesses including epilepsy, schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, autism spectrum disorders, and Alzheimer's disease, as well as cognitive deficits such as delayed acquisition of language. However, widespread use of these methods especially in large populations has been problematic because of the lack of well-established analysis approaches, which map the sensor data into the brain space for detailed temporal, spatial, and connectivity analysis. This research will provide well-documented and tested novel analysis software to promote both basic neuroscience and clinical research applications using MEG and EEG.",Scalable Software for Distributed Processing and Visualization of Multi-Site MEG/EEG Datasets,9750274,R01NS104585,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Communities ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' EEG ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' epileptogenic ', ' epileptiform ', ' epilepsia ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' Epileptics ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Head ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Laboratories ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Language Development ', ' magnetoencephalographic imaging ', ' MEG imaging ', ' Magnetoencephalography ', ' Maintenance ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' Noise ', ' Obsessive-Compulsive Neurosis ', ' Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Science ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Writing ', ' Measures ', ' Artifacts ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' falls ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Ecosystem ', ' Ecological Systems ', ' Ecologic Systems ', ' Guidelines ', ' Imagery ', ' Visualization ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Site ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Pythons ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Financial compensation ', ' Compensation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Measurement ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Head Movements ', ' Scientist ', ' millisecond ', ' Msec ', ' Hour ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' human data ', ' Cognitive deficits ', ' cognitive defects ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' software development ', ' developing computer software ', ' develop software ', ' Documentation ', ' Brain region ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' autistic spectrum disorder ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' Infantile Autism ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Autism ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Resolution ', ' Neurosciences Research ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cluster computing ', ' distributed computing ', ' datagrid ', ' data grid ', ' Visualization software ', ' visualization tool ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' data acquisition ', ' computing resources ', ' computational resources ', ' open source ', ' multithreading ', ' verification and validation ', ' Cloud Computing ', ' cloud computer ', ' Cloud Infrastructure ', ' cloud based ', ' temporal measurement ', ' time measurement ', ' temporal resolution ', ' pedagogy ', ' neurovascular coupling ', ' neuro-vascular coupling ', ' source localization ', ' sensor technology ', ' sensing technology ', ' Data Scientist ', ' analysis pipeline ', ' ']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2019,543993,MA-08,-0.004708745573298284
"Improved AD/ADRD Assessment Sensitivities Using a Novel In-Situ Sensor System Project Summary/Abstract  Accurate assessment of daily functions for individuals at risk for and with AD/ADRD, is fundamental to detection, diagnosis, and characterization of its progression and prescribed treatments. Current assessment techniques typically rely on non- continuous, discreet observations provided from a third party and covering single or limited performance domains. With significantly larger portions of American’s choosing to age in place, any assessment technology must be able to be in-situ (low-cost, ubiquitous) and operate without user interface (autonomous) to provide objective, cross-domain, and continuous daily function measurements and reporting.  The primary objective of this fast track SBIR project is to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of using the Birkeland Current Sovrin IoT system to continuously and accurately assess daily functions, ADLs, and IADLs, for persons experiencing cognitive decline in a home or assisted care settings. This includes direct comparison with an accepted assessment technique, ADCS-ADL/23. Machine learning and artificial intelligent techniques will be employed to identify novel subfactors for improved sensitivities from available sensor data combinations. Secondary objectives include establishing a significant data set of detailed daily actions (<10 sec resolution) for 100+ individuals with AD/ADRD. Long-term goals support future intervention studies through improved assessment tools with enhanced sensitivity to early and mid-stage decline.  The Birkeland Current Sovrin IoT system makes use of patented proximity-based energy monitoring and control sensors, data analytics and change detection algorithms to continuously monitor activities of individuals in a home or assisted care environment. Intelligent power-strips and battery-based sensors located throughout the home or facility, monitor real time absolute location of individuals, caregivers, and devices they interact with. Correlation of high-fidelity data allows accurate determination of activities, attribution to a specific individual, mobility measurement, and behavior assessment across traditional and novel ADL/IADL categories. Birkeland Current is teamed with Texas A&M Center for Population Health and Aging, Georgia, Tech Institute for People and Technology, Baylor Scott and White Division of Gerontology, and multiple home-care and assisted-care facilities, in the development of the study approach, implementation plan, analytics tools, and applications to aging populations and future intervention studies. Project Narrative  The proposed research would utilize novel, ubiquitous Internet-of-Things sensors and automated analytics to demonstrate enhanced sensitivity and future utility of continuous in-situ IADL/ADL data for dementia research and its effectiveness in characterizing interventions for Alzheimer’s and related dementias of aging populations in support of NIA stated priorities.",Improved AD/ADRD Assessment Sensitivities Using a Novel In-Situ Sensor System,9846881,R44AG065118,"['Adoption ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Behavioral Symptoms ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Communities ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' care facilities ', ' Healthcare Facility ', ' Health Facilities ', ' Health care facility ', ' Industry ', ' Institutes ', ' Intelligence ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Patents ', ' Legal patent ', ' Patients ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Publishing ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Technology ', ' Technology Assessment ', ' Testing ', ' Texas ', ' Time ', ' Use Effectiveness ', ' Measures ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' patient home care ', ' patient homecare ', ' Home Care ', ' Phase ', ' Series ', ' Gerontology ', ' biogerontology ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' tool ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' In Situ ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' American ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Categories ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Early identification ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Documentation ', ' behavioral assessment ', ' Behavior assessment ', ' Effectiveness ', ' IADL ', ' instrumental activity of daily living ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Resolution ', ' Centers for Population Health ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' SBIR ', ' Monitor ', ' Grouping ', ' groupings ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Metadata ', ' meta data ', ' cost ', ' data integration ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' daily functioning ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' analytical tool ', ' data acquisition ', ' aging population ', ' population aging ', ' aged population ', ' database structure ', ' data base structure ', ' personalized care ', ' personalized patient care ', ' individualized patient care ', ' individualized care ', ' Precision care ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' Data Analytics ', ' Internet of Things ', ' real time monitoring ', ' realtime monitoring ', ' aging in place ', ' age in place ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' Alzheimer related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' learning algorithm ', ' off-patent ', ' ']",NIA,BIRKELAND CURRENT LLC,R44,2019,350000,TX-17,-0.014534202086243984
"Enabling Technology for Safe Robot-assisted Surgical Micromanipulation Project Summary  The goal of this grant is to develop enabling technology and systems that address fundamental limitations in microsurgery with a specific focus on vitreoretinal surgery. Due to the inherent micro-scale and the fragility of the neurosensory retina, vitreoretinal surgeons can be challenged by physiological hand tremor where the tremor amplitude is larger than retinal structures, delicate movements that are below tactile sensation, and multiple cognitive decisions that are required when executing high-risk movements, such as during retinal vein cannulation (RVC). Nevertheless currently vitreoretinal surgery is at the limits of human physiological performance and lacks the adequate technology that could further improve the technical performance. This situation is less than optimal and can significantly benefit from the recent advances in medical robotics, sensor feedback and human machine interface design. Robotic assistance may be ideally suited to address common problems encountered in the performance of the demanding micromanipulations in retinal microsurgery.  We propose a robotic system with enhanced real-time multisensory feedback that assesses multiple points of instrument contact located both inside and outside of the eye. Our comprehensive system will enable the surgeon to manipulate tools based on quantitative feedback that will prevent mechanical injury by implementing safeguards against the application of excessive and previously unmeasurable forces at the eyewall and the tool tip. Our aims are: (1) Develop and demonstrate in vivo position/force hybrid control algorithms for enabling real- time high-fidelity sensorimotor capabilities at the sclerotomy for safe robot-assisted vitreoretinal microsurgery: real-time sensorimotor capabilities at the sclerotomy will be uniquely used to control the robot through a machine learning method that adaptively learns a nonlinear mapping from user behavior to sclera-force/position and predicts unsafe motions; (2) Develop and demonstrate in vivo force-input control algorithms for enabling real- time high-fidelity sensorimotor capabilities at the tool-tip for safe robot-assisted vein cannulation: real-time tool- tip-to-tissue interaction force sensing and non-linear robot control algorithms based on observing the user behavior will be used to control the tool-tip position and force and to prevent entry into subretinal areas during RVC; (3) Demonstrate safe robot-assisted RVC in rabbit model in vivo: real-time, position/force hybrid control algorithms based on dual-point (tool-shaft and tip) information fusion will provide sensorimotor guidance of surgical maneuvers during RVC. Statistically significant results in vivo, in clinically realistic conditions will demonstrate the feasibility of our approach.  This highly innovative system will enable surgeons to perform maneuvers in a tremor free environment with a higher level of precision than previously possible and with the ability to sense forces on a scale that have been previously imperceptible. We envision this development as a logical next step in the integration of man, machine and computer for the performance of unprecedented microsurgical maneuvers. Project Narrative  This R01 grant addresses fundamental limitations in current microsurgical practice, focusing on vitreoretinal surgery (VRS), which is the most technically demanding ophthalmologic surgery. Our goal is to develop a cooperatively controlled robotic system with enhanced sensorimotor capabilities that in conjunction with multifunction force-sensing microsurgical instruments could enable safe robot-assisted retinal surgery.

"Leveraging Artificial Intelligence for the assessment of severity of depressive symptoms Depression is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide, affecting an estimated 300 million people. Evidence-based treatments are available and measurement-based care has been described as the gold standard. Monitoring of depressive symptoms is currently performed with self-administered and interview- based assessment methods conducted by clinicians in their offices. However, the shortage of mental health specialists and the limited resources available to primary care physicians who often manage patients with depression, prevent close monitoring of symptoms delaying optimal treatment potentially prolonging suffering. Passive recording of behavioral data (gathering information without individual's direct input) has been identified as a potentially feasible method for long-term monitoring of depression. To date, most studies have collected passive behavioral data in ""real time"" through mobile apps (i.e. accelerometer, phone clicks) with the goal of identifying potential markers of depression. However, this method lacks critical biological indicators of depression, including sleep, arousal, and motion. Recent development in wristband sensor technology developed by out lab has allowed to measure physiological parameters like gait, heart rate variability (HRV) and electrodermal activity (EDA) continuously in “real time”, allowing a broader anatomical and neurophysiological understanding of emotion, behavior, and cognition in mood disorders as they occur during routine activity. During the past decade, along with the development of sensors, we have seen the progressive use of machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence that enables the detection of complex patterns in multimodal data, allowing the development of complex models. The combination of sensor technology and machine learning allows detailed measurement in real time of a wealth of behaviors predicting mood variation. Over the past 2 years, our interdisciplinary team, including one of the leading lab on depression research, and one of the most innovative lab on affective computing, has conducted a study applying machine learning analytics to create a model combining wristband sensors data and phone- based passive measurements to assess severity of depressive symptoms. In our pilot study with depressed patients monitored over 8 weeks, we found that an algorithm based on biological and behavioral sensor data could estimate depression severity evaluated by a clinician with high accuracy. The proposed study will further refine our model in a sample of 100 adults with depression, assessed over 12 weeks. We anticipate that the proposed study will enable the development of an objective, passive, sensor-based algorithm able to measure depressive symptom severity. The identification of reliable, objective, passive assessment of depressive symptoms with biosensors will have significant ramifications for the monitoring of depression, early detection of response, remission and relapse and ultimately contribute to the advancement of precision medicine. Narrative  The proposed project will create a novel method to assess depressive symptoms by harnessing modern machine learning analytics, phone sensors, and wrist-band sensors. Measurement-based treatment is considered optimal and the development of a valid passive, objective, behavioral and biological assessment of depressive symptoms that does not rely on clinician interviews will improve monitoring and ultimately improve treatment significantly. Ultimately, the ability to leverage a remarkable wealth of behavioral and biological data has the potential to transform the delivery of treatment for depression.",Leveraging Artificial Intelligence for the assessment of severity of depressive symptoms,9643493,R01MH118274,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Arousal ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Behavior ', ' Cognition ', ' Communication ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Emotions ', ' Gait ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Interview ', ' Melancholias ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Moods ', ' Motion ', ' neurophysiological ', ' neurophysiology ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Patients ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Self-Administered ', ' Self Administration ', ' Sleep ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Temperature ', ' Time ', ' Wrist ', ' Measures ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Specialist ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physical activity ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' Disease remission ', ' Remission ', ' information gathering ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' behavior measurement ', ' behavioral measurement ', ' behavioral measure ', ' Biosensor ', ' biological sensor ', ' novel ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' portability ', ' behavioral assessment ', ' Behavior assessment ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Prediction of Response to Therapy ', ' treatment response prediction ', ' treatment prediction ', ' therapy prediction ', ' predict treatment response ', ' predict therapy response ', ' predict therapeutic response ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Evidence based treatment ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' heart rate variability ', ' mobile application ', ' mobile app ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' anxious ', ' depressed patient ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' Accelerometer ', ' activity tracker ', ' activity monitor ', ' accelerometry ', ' sensor technology ', ' sensing technology ', ' wearable device ', ' wearable sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' body sensor ', ' optimal treatments ', ' optimal therapies ', ' affective computing ', ' multimodal data ', ' multi-modal data ', ' ']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2019,545657,MA-08,-0.0044986750420359595
"Integrate Dynamic System Model and Machine Learning for Calibration-Free Noninvasive ICP Project Summary  No clinical device exists for noninvasive intracranial pressure (nICP) assessment. Past attempts have focused on identifying ICP-related signals that are noninvasively measureable, but have done little to address the calibration problem. Without calibration, only ICP trending can be inferred at the best. However, noninvasive calibration is not trivial. A universal calibration will fail because individual patients require different calibration to obtain accurate results. On the other hand, the use of plain regression for individualized calibration is infeasible because ICP cannot be obtained noninvasively for a de novo patient to begin with.  Invasive ICP monitoring remains a standard of care and this can be leveraged to continuously grow a database of ICP, noninvasive signals, and different calibration equations, e.g., each built from a pair of invasive ICP and noninvasive signal in the database. Then nICP becomes feasible by selecting from a rich set of calibration equations the optimal choice for a de novo patient. In this project, we will pursue three aims that will lead to the development of an accurate noninvasive ICP system based on Transcranial Doppler. These aims are: 1) To implement and validate core algorithms needed for achieving accurate nICP; 2) To test if estimated nICP is sensitive to variations in ultrasound probe placement; 3) To test the generalizability of the proposed nICP approach.  Large epidemiologic surveys reveal that ICP is monitored in only about 58% of US patients when ICP monitoring is indicated. It is a smaller percentage (37%) in European patients and even fewer in developing countries. The proposed nICP approach does not have the high risks associated with invasive ICP, requires no onsite neurosurgical expertise, and can be economically deployed and readily practiced. Therefore, its potential impact is enormous. Project Narrative  No clinically accepted device exists for noninvasive intracranial pressure (ICP) assessment.

"THE XNAT IMAGING INFORMATICS PLATFORM PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal aims to continue the development of XNAT. XNAT is an imaging informatics platform designed to facilitate common management and productivity tasks for imaging and associated data. We will develop the next generation of XNAT technology to support the ongoing evolution of imaging research. Development will focus on modernizing and expanding the current system. In Aim 1, we will implement new web application infrastructure that includes a new archive file management system, a new event bus to manage cross-service orchestration and a new Javascript library to simplify user interface development. We will also implement new core services, including a Docker Container service, a dynamic scripting engine, and a global XNAT federation. In Aim 2, we will implement two innovative new capabilities that build on the services developed in Aim 1. The XNAT Publisher framework will streamline the process of data sharing by automating the creation and curation of data releases following best practices for data publication and stewardship. The XNAT Machine Learning framework will streamline the development and use of machine learning applications by integrating XNAT with the TensorFlow machine learning environment and implementing provenance and other monitoring features to help avoid the pitfalls that often plague machine learning efforts. For both Aim 1 and 2, all capabilities will be developed and evaluated in the context of real world scientific programs that are actively using the XNAT platform. In Aim 3, we will provide extensive support to the XNAT community, including training workshops, online documentation, discussion forums, and . These activities will be targeted at both XNAT users and developers. RELEVANCE Medical imaging is one of the key methods used by biomedical researchers to study human biology in health and disease.

"QuBBD: Geometric Time-Frequency Methods for Multi-modal Physiological Monitoring Modern health monitoring devices at hospitals and wearable sensors in households generate a large amount of time series data at high rate, capturing the physiological status of patients in a real-lime fashion. The premise is that these technology advances enable a data-driven healthcare system that starts making fast, accurate, objective and inexpensive decisions based upon data, in addition to an individual physician's experience and preference. However, there is a significant gap in the mathematical theory and computational tools to promptly extract actionable information from multi-modal non-stationary time series data in a robust and tractable manner, which has become a serious roadblock to further utilize bigger data for better healthcare monitoring. The goal of this research program is to develop a mathematical framework for extracting time-frequency and geometric representations of multi-modal physiological data, in an online and robust manner, and use them to design machine learning algorithms to improve real-lime health monitoring. Specifically, we hypothesize that the development of time-series and geometric methods for large streaming multi-modal monitoring data will lead to more accurate diagnosis on various physiological monitoring applications, including detection and prediction of rare events such as seizure and arrhythmia, classification of sleep stages for newborns and children, and real-time artifact removal of physiological data. To achieve our goal, we plan to develop novel theoretical and computational tools for analyzing non-stationary multi-modal time series data with noise, corruption and missing data as well as real-time algorithms for filtering and event detection from such data. The tools and algorithms will be applied on clinical tasks at the Nationwide Children's Hospital. In addition, the real-time workflow will be implemented on Hadoop clusters with a mission of public sharing of both data and software. The development from the interdisciplinary team composed of mathematicians, biomedical informaticians as well as the hospital will not only transform the frontiers of mathematics knowledge, but also significantly impact clinical applications, data science education, and the development of the $11 O billion emerging market of wireless health. The goal of this project is to develop a series of novel computational theory and software to extract physiological information from the large multi-modal data streams generated by modern health monitoring devices. The tools will be applied to various clinical tasks such as detection and prediction of seizure and arrhythmia and classification of sleep stages for newborns and children, aiming for more accurate diagnosis.",QuBBD: Geometric Time-Frequency Methods for Multi-modal Physiological Monitoring,9771321,R01EB025018,"['Algorithms ', ' Arrhythmia ', ' Heart Arrhythmias ', ' Cardiac Arrhythmia ', ' Breathing ', ' inspiration ', ' Respiratory Inspiration ', ' Respiratory Aspiration ', ' Behavior ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Clinical Informatics ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Environment ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Hospitals ', "" Children's Hospital "", ' Pediatric Hospitals ', ' Household ', ' Infant ', ' newborn children ', ' newborn child ', ' Newborns ', ' 0-4 weeks old ', ' Newborn Infant ', ' Math ', ' Mathematics ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Modernization ', ' Physiological Monitoring ', ' Physiologic Monitoring ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Seizures ', ' Sleep Stages ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Measures ', ' Artifacts ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Public Domains ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Series ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Human body ', ' Human Figure ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Stream ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' monitoring device ', ' science education ', ' novel ', ' graduate student ', ' Excision ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' Property ', ' theories ', ' Limes ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Validation ', ' Wireless Technology ', ' wireless ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' frontier ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' mathematical theory ', ' mathematics theory ', ' mathematics reasoning ', ' mathematics logic ', ' mathematic theory ', ' math theory ', ' Mathematical Reasoning ', ' Mathematical Logic ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' clinical practice ', ' heart rate variability ', ' biological systems ', ' geometric methodologies ', ' geometry methods ', ' geometry methodologies ', ' geometric method ', ' signal processing ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' accurate diagnosis ', ' student training ', ' Data Science ', ' diagnostic biomarker ', ' diagnostic marker ', ' wearable device ', ' wearable sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' body sensor ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' multimodal data ', ' multi-modal data ', ' education resources ', ' educational resources ', ' ']",NIBIB,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,255543,PA-18,-0.04691661050400502
"Slicer+PLUS: Collaborative, open-source software for ultrasound analysis Abstract The target users of the proposed Slicer+PLUS framework are researchers and developers who are focusing on low-cost point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) applications. POCUS applications are characterized by utilizing low-cost, portable U/S systems; in the hands of novice operators; with novel data acquisition, signal processing, and machine learning methods; with imprecise trackers; and in highly unconstrained point-of-care environments, e.g.: at the scene of accidents for patient triage, in the offices of general practitioners for scoliosis detection and monitoring, in patients' homes for an aging population, as well as throughout hospitals. In these contexts, many are considering POCUS devices to be the stethoscopes of the future.  The foundation of Slicer+PLUS is the integration and extension of 3D Slicer, PLUS, and MUSiiC. We are the developers of these libraries. We, and the users of our libraries, are proposing Slicer+PLUS so that the Slicer, PLUS, and MUSiiC communities can come together and cohesively address the important challenges and opportunities posed by POCUS applications. Over 30 letters of support are included with this application.  3D Slicer is a world-class, freely available open-source platform for medical image segmentation, registration, and visualization. PLUS is a world-class, open-source library for communicating with ultrasound machines and trackers (for following objects in 3D using magnetic, optical, and other technologies). MUSiiC is a (previously closed source) library that focuses on advanced ultrasound acquisition and analysis methods, such as ultrasound reconstruction pipelines, elastography, and photoacoustic imaging. Together, these toolkits have averaged over 5,100 downloads per month for the past year.  A central tenant of our work is that POCUS applications should not be viewed as simply involving the use of inexpensive, portable U/S systems; POCUS must be viewed as a new modality for it to attain its full potential. POCUS must involve innovative, automated data analysis methods and workflows that can guide a user to properly place and manipulate an ultrasound probe and interpret the returned ultrasound data. In particular, the output of those workflows and analyses should be quantitative measures, not b-mode images, since the expertise to interpret such images will not be readily available at points-of-care. To that end, the proposed work goes well beyond simple integration of Slicer, PLUS, and MUSiiC. Multiple innovations are proposed such as Ultrasound Spectroscopy for tissue labeling, Dynamic Textures for anatomic localization of ultrasound probes, and self-tracking ultrasound probes.  To assess our progress towards our goals, our team includes our target users: researchers, medical device manufacturers, and clinical innovators dedicated to low-cost POCUS applications. They will be validating our efforts by integrating them into their research and translational POCUS product development projects. Project Narrative  Low-cost ultrasound probes have the potential to become the stethoscopes of the future and revolutionize in-field and in-hospital patient care. Our goal is to integrate, enhance, and disseminate three cutting edge ultrasound acquisition, analysis, and display toolkits to create a new framework called Slicer+PLUS that will serve as a catalyst for research and product development into low-cost point-of-care ultrasound applications. In particular, our framework will include and facilitate innovative methods for guiding a novice user in ultrasound probe placement and for automatically interpreting ultrasound data to provide a diagnosis, without the user having to interpret a traditional B-mode ultrasound image at any point in the process. The Slicer+PLUS framework will be validated using tasks associated with (a) emergency service personnel performing Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) exams at the scene of an accident to detect or rule-out intra-abdominal bleeding; (b) the clinical monitoring of scoliosis progression in children in general practitioners' offices; and (c) the translation of research into regulatory-approved products based on Slicer+PLUS.","Slicer+PLUS: Collaborative, open-source software for ultrasound analysis",9750736,R01EB021396,"['Abdomen ', ' Abdominal ', ' Accidents ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Communities ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Diagnosis ', ' emergency service ', ' Emergency medical service ', ' Environment ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Generalists ', ' General Practitioners ', ' Goals ', ' blood loss ', ' Bleeding ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Hospitals ', ' Libraries ', ' Medical Device ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' optical ', ' Optics ', ' Patients ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' research and development ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Support ', ' scoliosis ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Spectrum Analyses ', ' Spectroscopy ', ' Spectrum Analysis ', ' backbone ', ' Spine ', ' Spinal Column ', ' Vertebral column ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' ultrasound scanning ', ' ultrasound imaging ', ' ultrasound ', ' sound measurement ', ' sonography ', ' sonogram ', ' diagnostic ultrasound ', ' Ultrasound Test ', ' Ultrasound Medical Imaging ', ' Ultrasound Diagnosis ', ' Ultrasonogram ', ' Ultrasonic Imaging ', ' Medical Ultrasound ', ' Echotomography ', ' Echography ', ' Ultrasonography ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Imagery ', ' Visualization ', ' catalyst ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' Stethoscopes ', ' Clinical ', ' Letters ', ' Shapes ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Life ', ' Frequencies ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Source ', ' Texture ', ' System ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' 3D ', ' 3-D ', ' Magnetism ', ' magnetic ', ' innovative technologies ', ' hospital patient care ', ' cohesion ', ' novel ', ' Modality ', ' Devices ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' software development ', ' developing computer software ', ' develop software ', ' portability ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Documentation ', ' Manufacturer Name ', ' Manufacturer ', ' image guided therapy ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Intra-abdominal ', ' Translational Research ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Monitor ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' point of care ', ' emergency service responder ', ' emergency service personnel ', ' emergency responder ', ' emergency personnel ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' cost ', ' reconstruction ', ' Three-dimensional analysis ', ' 3D analysis ', ' 3-dimensional analysis ', ' 3-D analysis ', ' Trauma ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' imaging Segmentation ', ' data acquisition ', ' open source ', ' aging population ', ' population aging ', ' aged population ', ' product development ', ' photoacoustic imaging ', ' optoacoustic imaging ', ' elastography ', ' elasticity imaging ', ' elastic imaging ', ' signal processing ', ' Patient Triage ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' clinical translation ', ' data pipeline ', ' off-label use ', ' off-label prescribing ', ' off-label application ', ' ']",NIBIB,"KITWARE, INC.",R01,2019,534944,NY-20,0.04734912538163165
"Developing Evidence- based User Centered Design and Implementation Guidelines to Improve Health Information Technology Usability ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of the proposed research is to provide an evidence-base to better inform user centered design and implementation processes to improve health information technology (health IT) usability and safety. The proposed research is in direct response to special emphasis notice (NOT-HS-15-005). Utilizing a hybrid approach of expert manual review and machine learning techniques, specifically natural language processing, we will develop methods to rapidly analyze patient safety event data to determine which events are health IT related. We will then further categorize the health IT related safety events to determine which events could have been prevented by effective usability or implementation processes. Through this analysis we will be able to specify the usability and implementation processes that are critical to the safe and effective use of health IT. This project utilizes the extensive expertise of the research team in human factors and safety science, health IT, and computer science.

"RAVE: A New Open Software Tool for Analysis and Visualization of Electrocorticography Data Project Summary/Abstract  A fast-growing technique in human neuroscience is electrocorticography (ECOG), the only technique that allows the activity of small population of neurons in the human brain to be directly recorded. We use the term ECOG to refer to the entire range of invasive recording techniques (from subdural strips and grids to penetrating electrodes) that share the common attribute of recording neural activity from the human brain with high spatial and temporal resolution. While this ability has resulted in many high-impact advances in understanding fundamental mechanisms of brain function in health and disease, it generates staggering amounts of data as a single patient can be implanted with hundreds of electrodes, each sampled thousands of times a second for hours or even days. The difficulty of exploring these vast datasets is the rate-limiting step in using them to improve human health. We propose to overcome this obstacle by creating an easy-to-use, powerful platform designed from the ground up for the unique properties of ECOG. We dub this software tool RAVE (“R Analysis and Visualization of Electrocorticography data”).  The first goal of Aim 1 is to release RAVE 1.0 to the entire ECOG community by month 6 of the first funding period. This will maximize transformative impact by putting the new tools in the hands of users as quickly as possible, facilitating rapid adoption. The design philosophy of RAVE is driven by three imperatives. The first is to keep users ""close to the data"" so that users may make discoveries about the brain without being misled by artifacts. The second imperative is rigorous statistical methodology. The final imperative is ""play well with others"". As described in Aim 2, our approach will make it easy to seamlessly incorporate new and existing analysis tools written in Matlab, C++, Python or R into RAVE, giving users the best of both worlds: advanced but easy-to-use visualization of results from ECOG experiments, whether they are analyzed with the off-the- shelf tools routines provided with RAVE or novel tools developed by others.

"Accelerating collaborative, cumulative, and open intervention science with an e-intervention authoring platform Background. Research has identified a wide range of evidence-based interventions for key behavioral health risks such as poor diet, smoking, unhealthy alcohol use, or a sedentary lifestyle. However, to be truly successful, behavioral intervention science should fulfill at least three key criteria: (1) demonstration of cumulative increases in intervention efficacy; (2) provision of interventions that reach a high proportion of those in need; and (3) demonstration of a meaningful population impact/reduction in disease burden. It currently meets none of these. Some reasons for this include (1) over-reliance on an imprecise delivery mechanism (people; usually therapists or coaches of some kind) that is difficult to train to fidelity on a large scale, and that cannot be manipulated with precision; (2) use of sample sizes that may be far below what is needed to accurately characterize heterogeneity of response; and (3) cross-study variability in therapist characteristics, sample characteristics, and measurement strategy. All of this combines to create a science that lacks evidence of cumulative improvements upon prior benchmarks. Proposed solution. Mobile technology shows significant promise as an intervention delivery mechanism that is replicable, transparent, modular, and precise. However, progress in the development and implementation of mobile interventions has been slowed by factors such as the tremendous time and money needed to develop an intervention; limitations in cross-platform compatibility and interoperability; and lack of a consistent system around which to collaborate. To address these needs, the PI developed the Computerized Intervention Authoring System (CIAS), which facilitates behavioral intervention science by allowing investigators to directly develop sophisticated and interactive mobile applications without programming. CIAS is already being used by investigators outside of the PI’s own lab, a process that has revealed significant interest in this software from a wide range of NIH-funded investigators, as well as significant limitations. Current aims. The proposed application will address these limitations, making CIAS into a significant, open-source, and virtually unique non-commercial research resource. In Aim 1, we will engage in sustained user experience testing designed to make the tool far more intuitive to use. This process is expected to result in a dramatic reorganization of the investigator interface, as well as in a complete set of evidence-based user training and support materials. In Aim 2, we will add a range of features and capabilities to make CIAS more powerful, flexible, and interoperable (e.g., by building to SMART Health IT standards, as well as FHIR open specifications to facilitate integration with Electronic Health Records). In Aim 3, we will engage in focused efforts to promote the use of CIAS as part of multi-lab collaborations using open science practices (e.g., via integration with the Open Science Framework). Importantly, we will engage in all of the above with the assistance of a highly accomplished panel of advisors who will help ensure that the final product is broadly relevant, future-facing, and usable to a broad range of behavioral scientists. Technology-delivered interventions are showing great potential to help people modify unhealthy behaviors like substance use, poor diet, and poor medication adherence. However, designing these interventions is time- consuming and expensive, which is slowing down research in this area as well as the rate at which such technology can help people. This project will take existing research software and significantly enhance it so it can allow scientists to easily and quickly collaborate to develop powerful interventions for mobile devices.","Accelerating collaborative, cumulative, and open intervention science with an e-intervention authoring platform",9882671,U24EB028990,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Budgets ', ' Computers ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating ', ' Elements ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Interview ', ' Investments ', ' Language ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Smoking ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Support ', ' Translations ', ' Work ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' Ecosystem ', ' Ecological Systems ', ' Ecologic Systems ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Intuition ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Measurement ', ' Sample Size ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Scientist ', ' System ', ' good diet ', ' balanced diet ', ' Healthy diet ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' Support System ', ' Social Support System ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' brief intervention ', ' brief treatment ', ' brief therapy ', ' Sampling ', ' behavioral health ', ' response ', ' repository ', ' software development ', ' developing computer software ', ' develop software ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Documentation ', ' Apple ', ' Malus domestica ', ' Public Health Informatics ', ' consumer informatics ', ' Health Informatics ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' Behavioral ', ' medication compliance ', ' medication adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' Operating System ', ' National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering ', ' NIBIB ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' cost ', ' burden of illness ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' virtual ', ' computerized ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' diet and exercise ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' alcohol misuse ', ' unhealthy alcohol use ', ' ethanol misuse ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' interoperability ', ' open source ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' mobile device ', ' user centered design ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' evidence base ', ' intervention effect ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' reduced substance use ', ' substance use reduction ', ' reduction in substance use ', ' mHealth ', ' mobile health ', ' m-Health ', ' mobile application ', ' mobile app ', ' sedentary lifestyle ', ' Sedentary life-style ', ' Sedentary behavior ', ' healthy weight ', ' mobile computing ', ' mobile technology ', ' mobile platform ', ' open data ', ' open-source data ', ' open science ', ' Text Messaging ', ' texting ', ' short message service ', ' SMART health ', ' Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources ', ' FHIR ', ' ']",NIBIB,WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY,U24,2019,399297,MI-13,-0.02715095373925767
"Technology-supported training and quality assurance for psychosocial interventions Millions of Americans receive psychosocial interventions such as psychotherapy each year for treatment of mental health, behavioral health, and addiction problems. Evidence-based psychotherapies such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) are increasingly emphasized in professional practice guidelines, taught in training programs, sought out by consumers, and valued by payers. Yet, at present, there is no scalable method for evaluating the quality of psychotherapy services. In research settings, human-based behavioral coding methods are used, but these are time consuming, costly, and rarely used in real-world clinical settings.  Psychotherapy is a “talk based” treatment, and as such, the active ingredients and quality of the therapy are found in the spoken language and interaction of clinician and client. The current proposal will develop a software system (CORE-CBT) that will automatically generate a summary report of quality metrics for CBT, from an audio recording of a CBT session, using speech signal processing and machine learning. Importantly, the current work builds from previous, successful work in developing CORE-MI, an automated system for evaluating motivational interviewing for addiction. The existing CORE-MI tool and the expertise gained through its development will serve as the foundation for the current proposal.  Our technical team is complemented by clinical and implementation expertise via the partnership of the Beck Community Initiative (BCI) with Philadelphia’s DBHIDS. Since 2007, BCI has partnered in training staff at 60 programs in the DBHIDS network to deliver high-quality CBT, including objective quality ratings via the Cognitive Therapy Rating Scale (CTRS). Through ongoing training efforts, the BCI has generated an archive of over 6,500 recorded CBT sessions, of which more than 2,300 have been CTRS-coded for quality. This session archive and ongoing real-world trainings in the DBHIDS network provide the perfect context to develop CORE-CBT, a tool that automates quality coding for CBT.  Aim 1: ​Extend and evaluate machine learning algorithms to automatically code CBT competence, using an archive of more than 2,000 CBT fidelity-coded sessions. ​Aim 2: ​Adapt and enhance front-end user interface and session reports with key stakeholders (frontline clinicians, supervisors, and clinic administrators), evaluating acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility. ​Aim 3: ​Evaluate CORE-CBT technology during CBT training in 4 BCI partner clinics in the DBHIDS network, with approximately 48-64 frontline clinicians and 4,000 sessions, assessing both implementation outcomes (adoption, sustainment) and service outcomes (increased capacity, efficiency, and effectiveness of training). ​Aim 4:​ Evaluate the appropriateness of CORE-CBT and its metrics for quality assurance (clinics) and value-based reimbursement (payers), using an in-person participatory design workshop. An advisory board of behavioral health payers will provide feedback over the course of the study to maximize generalizability and future uptake in large healthcare systems. PROJECT NARRATIVE Evidence-based psychotherapies such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) are increasingly emphasized in professional practice guidelines, taught in training programs, sought out by consumers, and valued by payers.

"Intelligent deployment of containerized bioinformatics workflows on the cloud PROJECT SUMMARY Cloud computing has emerged as a promising solution to address the challenges of big data. Public cloud vendors provide computing as-a-utility enabling users to pay only for the resources that are actually used. In this application, we will develop methods and tools to enable biomedical researchers to optimize the costs of cloud computing when analyzing biomedical big data. Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) cloud provides computing as a utility, on-demand, to end users, enabling cloud resources to be rapidly provisioned and scaled to meet computational and performance requirements. In addition, dynamic intelligent allocation of cloud computing resources has great potential to both improve performance and reduce hosting costs. Unfortunately, determining the most cost-effective and efficient ways to deploy modules on the cloud is non- trivial, due to a plethora of cloud vendors, each providing different types of virtual machines with different capabilities, performance trade-offs, and pricing structures. In addition, modern bioinformatics workflows consist of multiple modules, applications and libraries, each with their own set of software dependencies. Software containers package binary executables and scripts into modules with their software dependencies. With containers that compartmentalize software dependencies, modules implemented as containers can be mixed and matched to create workflows that give identical results on any platform. The high degree of reproducibility and flexibility of software containers makes them ideal instruments for disseminating complex bioinformatics workflows. Our overarching goal is to deliver the latest technological advances in containers and cloud computing to a typical biomedical researcher with limited resources who works with big data. Specifically, we will develop a user-friendly drag-and-drop interface to enable biomedical researchers to build and edit containerized workflows. Most importantly, users can choose to deploy and scale selected modules in the workflow on cloud computing platforms in a transparent, yet guided fashion, to optimize cost and performance. Our aim is to provide a federated approach that leverages resources from multiple cloud vendors. We have assembled a team of interdisciplinary scientists with expertise in bioinformatics, cloud and distributed computing, and machine learning. As part of this application, we will work closely with end users who routinely generate and analyze RNA-seq data. We will illustrate how our containerized, cloud-enabled methods and tools will benefit bioinformatics analyses. Project Narrative Cloud computing has emerged as a promising solution to address the challenge of analyzing diverse and massive data generated to advance our understanding of health and diseases. We will develop methods and tools to build and intelligently deploy modular and cloud-enabled bioinformatics workflows. These tools will allow the biomedical community to optimize the costs associated with cloud computing and to facilitate the replication of scientific results.",Intelligent deployment of containerized bioinformatics workflows on the cloud,9827788,R01GM126019,"['Communities ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Drug toxicity ', ' Feedback ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' Intelligence ', ' Libraries ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Privatization ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Software Tools ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vendor ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' pricing ', ' Price ', ' technical skills ', ' Technical Expertise ', ' case report ', ' Case Study ', ' Schedule ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Ensure ', ' Data Storage and Retrieval ', ' data storage ', ' data retrieval ', ' Technology Transfer ', ' tool ', ' instrument ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Services ', ' Performance ', ' biomedical scientist ', ' Structure ', ' expectation ', ' outreach ', ' Modeling ', ' RNA analysis ', ' Documentation ', ' Drops ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Educational Materials ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Docking ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' cost ', ' virtual ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' distributed data ', ' cluster computing ', ' distributed computing ', ' datagrid ', ' data grid ', ' cost effective ', ' computing resources ', ' computational resources ', ' user-friendly ', ' graphical user interface ', ' graphic user interface ', ' Graphical interface ', ' tool development ', ' prototype ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' Cloud Computing ', ' cloud computer ', ' Cloud Infrastructure ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' big biomedical data ', ' large-scale biomedical data ', ' Cloud Service ', ' cloud platform ', ' cloud server ', ' Infrastructure ', ' computational platform ', ' computing platform ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2019,33190,WA-07,0.008930312471133307
"LifeSense: Transforming Behavioral Assessment of Depression Using Personal Sensing Technology Abstract Depression is common, costly, and a leading cause of disability. Assessment of behavior and experience related to depression has tended to rely on self-report and interview-based methods. Environmental momentary assessment inserts assessment into people's lives, but still requires active engagement by those being evaluated. We propose to develop and validate a mobile phone-based personal sensing system to detect depression and related behaviors that relies on sensor data that are collected continuously and unobtrusively. Because people tend to keep their phones with them, the mobile phone is an ideal sensing platform, as it can continuously collect data in the context of the individual's life with no ongoing effort on the part of the user. Such systems are already being used to detect simple behaviors, such as activity recognition and sleep quantification, which are more proximal to the sensor data. Aim 1 will develop markers for a broad range of behavioral targets related to symptoms of major depressive episode (MDE; anhedonia, negative mood, sleep disruption, psychomotor activity, fatigue, and diminished concentration) and related domains (e.g. social functioning, stress, motivation) across a representative sample of participants. Aim 2 will combine all behavioral targets using machine learning to 1) estimate MDE and symptom severity cross-sectionally, 2) identify transition from non-depressed to depressed states, and depressed to non-depressed states, and 3) predict MDE and symptom severity 4 and 8 weeks out. Aim 3 will seek to understand the complex relationships among behavioral targets and depression. We will accomplish this by enrolling 1200 representative participants, in six 4-month waves of data collection. Each participant will download software that collects a wide variety of sensor data (GPS, accelerometry, light, Bluetooth, phone usage, etc.) and an app that collects ecological momentary assessments (EMA). Following each wave we will develop algorithms for a subset of behavioral targets and features (a definition of raw sensor data that incorporates meaning, like translating GPS data into “home”). Each algorithm will then be validated in the subsequent wave. After 5 waves (1000 participants), the set of all markers of behavioral targets and features will be combined using machine learning to detect and predict depression. This hierarchical approach extracts information from data at multiple levels, which ultimately is far more likely to succeed than relying solely on raw sensor data. The final wave will serve to replicate and validate the entire depression prediction model. This sensing platform is scientifically significant, as it will provide a fundamentally new tool for obtaining continuous, objective markers of behavior that are relevant to depression, as well as many other psychiatric and medical disorders. This project has the potential develop new understandings into the etiology of depression. It is clinically significant, as it will allow for continuous, effortless assessment of populations at risk for depression and ongoing evaluation during treatment. Project Narrative We propose to develop a sensing platform that uses mobile phone sensor data to detect a broad range of behaviors related to depression, as well as detect and predict depressive states that require treatment. This system will be able to run unobtrusively and continuously on people's phones.

"Sensor-based Just-in Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) Targeting Eating Behavior PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Long-term weight control is difficult to achieve and requires permanent changes in eating behavior. Emerging wearable sensor technology enables accurate and objective measurement of ingestive behavior, and real-time analysis of the sensor data paves the way for development of individually tailored and immediately delivered intervention (just-in-time adaptive Intervention; JITAI) to change eating behavior. Grounded in empirically and theoretically supported behavior change strategies for weight control, the proposed project relies on the synergy of wearable sensor technology, machine learning, behavioral science, personalized medicine, and nutrition to deliver and test such JITAIs. We previously developed a wearable sensor, the Automatic Ingestion Monitor (AIM), that automatically and accurately detects eating and characterizes meal microstructure (e.g., eating duration, rate of ingestion). These data can also be used to accurately estimate energy intake. The goals of this project are to: 1) use the AIM to study two common behavioral patterns observed among individuals with overweight/obesity, namely, excessive total daily energy intake (EI) and fast eating rate; 2) define the optimal personalized triggering metrics for two JITAIs targeting these behaviors; and 3) evaluate JITAIs’ effects on daily energy intake and targeted behaviors. In fulfillment of these goals, we will first conduct a study to characterize the target eating behaviors, then simulate and define triggering metrics for personalized JITAIs to change targeted eating behaviors and decrease EI. The JITAIs are rooted in self-regulation theory (SRT): setting a behavioral goal and monitoring progress toward that goal, with feedback to reinforce success. To enable the SRT-informed JITAIs, we will first use the AIM to collect data about ingestive behaviors quantified by objective, sensor-measured metrics from 90 adults with overweight/obesity who will wear the device for one week in free living conditions. Second, using the collected dataset, we will: a) analyze individual curves of cumulative daily EI and rate of eating within eating episodes to define triggering parameters for personalized JITAI delivery, and b) numerically simulate JITAI delivery and effects. We will then conduct a second study to evaluate the immediate effect of JITAIs on EI and ingestive behavior in free living participants. We will conduct a within-subjects trial with 128 adults wearing the AIM for 7 weeks. To personalize JITAIs, the AIM will learn individual eating patterns over a 1-week run-in period. Each JITAI will be delivered for two weeks (weeks 2-3 and 5-6) in a randomized crossover design with the resulting daily EI and ingestive behavior compared to baseline and the acceptability of the JITAIs assessed via questionnaire. On washout weeks 4 and 7, participants will continue to wear the AIM (no JITAIs) to assess persistence of intervention effects. The proposed project is the first step in demonstrating that AIM-based JITAIs can alter a variety of eating behaviors associated with excess EI. PROJECT NARRATIVE Achievement of changes in eating behaviors that facilitate long-term weight loss and maintenance is elusive. Emerging wearable sensor technology allows for accurate and objective measurement of ingestive behavior. Real-time analysis of the sensor data paves the way for individually tailored just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs) based on empirically and theoretically supported behavior change strategies for healthy eating and weight control. The proposed project relies on synergy of wearable sensor technology, machine learning, behavioral science, personalized medicine, and nutrition to test two such JITAIs driven by the Automatic Ingestion Monitor (AIM), a device that automatically detects and characterize eating behavior in real-time.

"Development/Commercialization of a Sensing Device to Detect Vaping Development/Commercialization of a Sensing Device to Detect Vaping Summary The use of e-cigarettes or vaping has been steadily increasing since its introduction. While potentially a tool to wean cigarette smokers from combustible tobacco, one consequence of the introduction of these devices has been the adoption of vaping by adolescents. While companies that offer vaping instruments for sale note that their material is directed to adults and intended as an aid for smoking cessation, recent reports have demonstrated that middle school and high school students in many countries, some as young as thirteen, have taken to vaping. Data analysis from a 2015 study in the U.S. indicated that 16% of high school students and 5% of middle school students reported vaping in the past thirty days. Most researchers speculated that the number of users would increase from these baselines and evidence indicates that this prediction is correct. Anecdotal evidence indicates that vaping in middle school and high school bathrooms is a major problem. FreshAir Sensor currently sells tobacco and marijuana smoking sensors along with 24/7 monitoring of the devices. The company has leveraged the knowledge of sensor development to produce preliminary components of an early stage sensing system capable of detecting vaping. Preliminary data to demonstrate this accomplishment is provided. The fast track research described in this proposal will enable the optimization of the sensor as well as commercialization of the resulting instrument in minimal time. The need to reduce and eventually eliminate adolescent vaping is urgent. The deployment of the proposed device in schools and other educational institutions will eliminate vaping during school hours and will, therefore, contribute to improvements in the overall health of adolescents by curtailing nicotine intake. Narrative Vaping has become a problem in schools with students, in steadily increasing numbers, using bathrooms and other less monitored spaces to indulge in the use of the newest vaping hardware. FreshAir Sensor is developing a sensor to detect vaping in otherwise unmonitored spaces.

"Advancing Human Health by Lowering Barriers to Electrophysiology in Genetic Model Organisms Project Summary The nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans has proven valuable as a model for many high-impact medical conditions. The strength of C. elegans derives from the extensive homologies between human and nematode genes (60-80%) and the many powerful tools available to manipulate genes in C. elegans, including expressing human genes. Researchers utilizing medical models based on C. elegans have converged on two main quantifiable measures of health and disease: locomotion and feeding; the latter is the focus of this proposal. C. elegans feeds on bacteria ingested through the pharynx, a rhythmic muscular pump in the worm’s throat. Alterations in pharyngeal activity are a sensitive indicator of dysfunction in muscles and neurons, as well as the animal’s overall health and metabolic state. C. elegans neurobiologists have long recognized the utility of the elec- tropharyngeogram (EPG), a non-invasive, whole-body electrical recording analogous to an electrocardiogram (ECG), which provides a quantitative readout of feeding. However, technical barriers associated with whole- animal electrophysiology have limited its adoption to fewer than fifteen laboratories world-wide. NemaMetrix Inc. surmounted these barriers by developing a turn-key, microfluidic system for EPG acquisition and analysis called the the ScreenChip platform. The proposed research and commercialization activities significantly expand the capabilities of the ScreenChip platform in two key respects. First, they enlarge the phenotyping capabilities of the platform by incorporating high-speed video of whole animal and pharyngeal movements. Second they develop a cloud database compatible with Gene Ontology, Open Biomedical Ontologies and Worm Ontology standards, allowing data-mining of combined electrophysiological, imaging and other data modalities. The machine-readable database will be compatible with artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms. It will be accessible to all researchers to enable discovery of relationships between genotypes, phenotypes and treatments using large-scale analysis of multidimensional phenotypic profiles.

"3D temperature control to study biological processes Project Summary Temperature control technology is necessary for a broad range of biologically relevant processes including organ-on-chip operation, biomolecular kinetics, cell growth, studying gene function with temperature-sensitive mutations, cancer cell resistance to hyperthermia treatments, protein crystallization, and DNA analysis. Most biosensing devices lack the needed temperature measurement accuracy and precise temperature control to understand the thermal mechanisms of these processes. For example, temperature variations of 0.2°C can activate heat shock proteins, increasing the resistance of cancer cells to thermal ablation treatment, but reported temperature accuracies are often near ±1°C. This proposal aims to revolutionize the biomedical temperature measurement and control ecosystem by developing technology, models, and validated devices capable of microscopic, spatially resolved temperature sensing and control at ±0.1°C accuracy (10x better than what is used in most biosensing systems). Microfluidics is a promising technology for an extremely broad range of biomedical applications that notably lacks the necessary temperature accuracies and spatial temperature control to effectively study biothermal mechanisms. This proposal intends to impact human health by developing disruptive temperature control tools to accelerate biomedical innovation in thermally sensitive processes. Our group recently demonstrated the capacity to measure temperature at a single point with fluorescent dyes, achieving a ±0.05°C noise floor by using machine learning techniques. We have also 3D printed a cell-based genotype and phenotype assay device with cell growth chambers, monoliths for mRNA capture & fluorescence measurement, and integrated pumps and valves in a volume of only 2.2 mm × 2.2 mm × 1 mm. Aims 1 and 2 of this proposal will build on these successes by developing 3D printing technologies that easily incorporate complex temperature sensing, heating, and cooling channels, coupled with multi-physics/CAD models to rapidly iterate through the prototype development cycle. These advances will be used in Aim 3 to construct a microscopically temperature-controlled chip to measure DNA melt curves to determine the zygosity of a Factor 5 Leiden. This will show that the technology can detect the subtle difference in melting temperature that is undetectable by most PCR machines, as a proof-of-concept before the technology can be applied to other biological process. The overall objective of these studies is to develop a suite of affordable technologies researchers can use to understand biothermal mechanisms to lay the foundation for advances in disease diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. Project Narrative The instruments we use to study the effects of temperature on biological processes are less accurate than humans’ own ability to perceive temperature changes. The proposed research will develop improved microscopic temperature sensing & control technologies and demonstrate them by performing DNA analysis in a 3D printed device. Because the technology is cheap and accurate, it will be widely accessible to any lab, increasing our ability to understand the fundamental role biothermal processes have in disease occurrence, diagnosis, and treatment.",3D temperature control to study biological processes,9732034,R15GM132868,"['Automation ', ' Biochemistry ', ' Biological Chemistry ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Biosensing Techniques ', ' biosensing ', ' Biosensing Technics ', ' Cellular Growth ', ' Cellular Expansion ', ' cell growth ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Crystallization ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' labile factor ', ' labile component ', ' Proaccelerin ', ' Factor Pi ', ' Coagulation Factor V ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor V ', ' AC Globulin ', ' Factor V ', ' Floor ', ' Fluorescence ', ' fluorescent dye/probe ', ' Fluorescent Agents ', ' Fluorescence Agents ', ' Fluorescent Dyes ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' stress protein ', ' Heat shock proteins ', ' Heating ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Kinetics ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' Persons ', ' Noise ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physics ', ' Printing ', ' Proteins ', ' Reagent ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' resin ', ' Plant Resins ', ' Risk ', ' mRNA ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Spatial Distribution ', ' Technology ', ' Temperature ', ' thermoreception ', ' temperature sensation ', ' Temperature Sense ', ' Testing ', ' temperature receptor ', ' Thermoreceptors ', ' Thromboembolism ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Factor Analyses ', ' Factor Analysis ', ' Custom ', ' Ecosystem ', ' Ecological Systems ', ' Ecologic Systems ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Thermometry ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Pump ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' DNA analysis ', ' hyperthermia treatment ', ' hyperthermia therapy ', ' clinical hyperthermia ', ' Microscopic ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' Measurement ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' Heat Stress Disorders ', ' heat-related illness ', ' Heat Stress Syndromes ', ' Heat Stress ', ' gene function ', ' Shapes ', ' cancer cell ', ' Malignant Cell ', ' Electrical Engineering ', ' tool ', ' instrument ', ' Venous ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Mechanics ', ' mechanical ', ' Hour ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' 3D ', ' 3-D ', ' High temperature of physical object ', ' high temperature ', ' innovative technologies ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' computer science ', ' melting ', ' Thermal Ablation Therapy ', ' thermal tumor ablation ', ' thermal ablation ', ' graduate student ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Prevention ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' µfluidic ', ' Microfluidics ', ' Q-Dot ', ' Quantum Dots ', ' Institution ', ' Microfluidic Microchips ', ' microfluidic chip ', ' Microfluidic Lab-On-A-Chip ', ' Microfluidic Device ', ' Microfluidic Analytical Techniques ', ' Microfluidic Analysis ', ' Microfluidic Analyses ', ' Resolution ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' prototype ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' biological systems ', ' operation ', ' undergraduate student ', ' undergraduate ', ' 3D Print ', ' three dimensional printing ', ' 3D printer ', ' 3-D printer ', ' 3-D print ', ' Hyperthermia ', ' Geometry ', ' improved outcome ', ' sensor technology ', ' sensing technology ', ' organ on a chip ', ' organ on chip ', ' ']",NIGMS,BRIGHAM YOUNG UNIVERSITY,R15,2019,439058,UT-03,-0.016192928682913697

"Evaluating and Improving Assistive Robotic Devices Continuously and in Real-time Project Summary Lower limb assistive robotic devices, such as active prosthesis, orthoses, and exoskeletons have the potential to restore function for the millions of Americans who experience mobility challenges due to injury and disability. Since individuals with mobility challenges have an increased energetic cost of transport, the benefit of such assistive devices is commonly assessed via the reduction in the metabolic work rate of the individual who is using the device. Currently, metabolic work rate can only be obtained in a laboratory environment, using breath-by-breath measurements of respiratory gas analysis. To obtain a single steady state data point of metabolic work rate, multiple minutes of data must be collected, since the signals are noisy, sparsely sampled, and dynamically delayed. In addition, the user has to wear a mask and bulky equipment, further restricting the applicability of the method on a larger scale. We propose an improved way to obtain such estimates of metabolic work rate in real-time. Aim 1 will determine salient signal features and characterize the dynamics of sensing metabolic work rate from a variety of physiological sensor signals. Aim 2 will use advanced sensor fusion and machine learning techniques to accurately predict instantaneous energy cost in real-time from multiple physiological signals without relying on a metabolic mask. Aim 3 will use the obtained real-time estimates to optimize push-off timing for an active robotic prosthesis. The resulting methods will enable an automated and continuous evaluation of assistive robotic devices that can be realized outside the laboratory and with simple wearable sensors. This automated evaluation will enable devices, such as active prostheses, orthoses, or exoskeletons, that can self-monitor their performance, optimize their own behavior, and continuously adapt to changing circumstances. This will open up a radically new way of human-robot- interaction for assistive devices. It will greatly increase their clinical viability and enable novel advanced controllers and algorithms that can improve device performance on a subject specific basis. Project Narrative A common way of evaluating assistive robotic devices, such as active prostheses or exoskeletons, is by measuring the reduction in effort that they bring to an individual walking in them. The proposed project will develop ways to perform this evaluation automatically and in real-time by the device itself, which will be used in the future to develop prostheses and exoskeletons that automatically adapt themselves to their users.

"A mobile sensing system to monitor symptoms during chemotherapy Cancer treatments can cause a variety of poorly-managed symptoms and toxicities that can impair quality of life and functioning and lead to early discontinuation of life-prolonging medical treatment. The goals of the proposed study are (1) to develop a novel mobile sensing system to passively monitor symptom burden during chemotherapy and (2) to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of using this system to recommend patient-provider communication. To accomplish Aim 1, we will enroll 200 oncology patients starting a new chemotherapy regimen and will collect smartphone and wearable sensor data continuously as well as daily patient-reported symptoms via smartphones for 90 days. Using machine learning methods, we will retrospectively analyze data from the first 100 participants and develop a generalizable and parsimonious population-level model to identify severe symptom days. For the second 100 participants, we will run these computational models in real-time and prospectively evaluate the accuracy of our classifications relative to patient-reported symptoms. For Aim 2, we will enroll 50 patients in a prospective single-arm trial of a system that uses inferences based on sensing and machine learning to recommend contact with providers and will evaluate patient accrual, attrition, and compliance as well as information from both patients and their providers about acceptability and perceived usefulness of the system. The scientific premise of this proposal is that mobile sensing of subtle fluctuations in behavior coupled with real-time computational modeling could enable earlier detection and ultimately better management of severe symptoms during cancer treatment. The proposed project builds on our prior research and completes the necessary development and feasibility work to support a large multisite trial comparing the mobile sensing system to standard of care to determine effects on symptom burden, quality of life, health care utilization, and survival. Public health relevance: Symptoms during cancer treatment are common, compromise patient quality of life and ability to tolerate treatment, and often go undetected at clinic visits.

"Socioeconomic status, stress, and smoking cessation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The prevalence of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) is rising dramatically among both adults and youth and ENDS use is fast becoming a major public health issue. However, because of their recent emergence, researchers know little about ENDS, their use, their effects on human physiology and health, their risks and benefits, or their impact on tobacco control efforts. A common barrier to studying ENDS is the lack of data on objective, real world use of ENDS. Thus, the proposed project aims to adapt existing innovative mobile assessment tools that can be used to target critical ENDS research gaps by providing mobile sensing technology that can objectively collect precise data regarding ENDS use in real time in real world. Specifically, the proposed revision project will expand the scope of Project On Track (1R01CA190329-01A1, PI: Wetter) by extending the application of puffMarker, an existing tool that automatically detects smoking, for the assessment of ENDS use. The current project has three aims: 1) adapt and validate puffMarker to identify discrete episodes of ENDS use, 2) adapt and validate puffMarker to distinguish between cigarette smoking and ENDS use among dual users of ENDS and cigarettes, and 3) utilize the Project On Track protocol to collect real time, real world data investigating potential determinants of ENDS use among both exclusive ENDS users as well as dual users of cigarettes and ENDS. Altogether, 120 participants (30 for Aim 1, 30 for Aim 2, and 60 for Aim 3) will be enrolled. Participants recruited for Aims 1 and 2 will attend laboratory (three 2-hour sessions) and field (3 days) studies. In the laboratory sessions, participants will wear the AutoSense wireless sensors and be asked to use ENDS (Aim 1) or use ENDS and smoke a cigarette (Aim 2). Participants' ENDS and cigarette puffs will be recorded by an independent observer. In the field studies, participants will wear the AutoSense wireless sensors and be asked to use ENDS (Aim 1) or use ENDS and smoke cigarettes (Aim 2). Participants will be asked to record each instance of ENDS use or cigarette smoking on a SP. The goals of the laboratory studies are to collect data to train puffMarker to identify ENDS use and to distinguish between cigarette smoking and ENDS use. The goal of the field studies is to validate puffMarker in real-life, natural environments. Aim 3 will utilize the Project On Track protocol to collect the first real time, real world data on ENDS and dual use. Participants will be assessed for 6 days using AutoSense, EMA, and GPS to examine potential determinants of ENDS use. A validated puffMarker that detects ENDS use and distinguishes between ENDS use and smoking can enhance many areas of research inquiry on ENDS. Knowledge learned from Aim 3 will be essential for the development of comprehensive conceptual models with respect to ENDS use and smoking cessation. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project aims to develop an innovative tool that targets important ENDS research gaps by offer- ing researchers the latest mobile sensing technology to objectively collect precise data regarding ENDS use and distinguish between ENDS use and smoking in real time and in real world.","Socioeconomic status, stress, and smoking cessation",9829886,R01CA190329,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Algorithms ', ' Breathing ', ' inspiration ', ' Respiratory Inspiration ', ' Respiratory Aspiration ', ' Behavior ', ' Environment ', ' Geography ', ' Gestures ', ' Goals ', ' Hand ', ' Health ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Laboratories ', ' body movement ', ' Movement ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Physiology ', ' Public Health ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Stress ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Wrist ', ' Measures ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' smoking cessation ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Series ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Training ', ' Oral cavity ', ' Mouth ', ' Cavitas Oris ', ' Buccal Cavity Head and Neck ', ' Buccal Cavity ', ' Individual ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' cigarette use ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' participant recruitment ', ' uptake ', ' tool ', ' Smoker ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' respiratory ', ' psychosocial ', ' experience ', ' field study ', ' field test ', ' field learning ', ' field based data ', ' Cigarette ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Harm Reduction ', ' Harm Minimization ', ' Laboratory Study ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Chest ', ' Thorax ', ' Thoracic ', ' Thorace ', ' Modeling ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Wireless Technology ', ' wireless ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' tobacco control ', ' biobehavior ', ' biobehavioral ', ' systems research ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Abstinence ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' parent grant ', ' primary outcome ', ' population health ', ' High School Student ', ' Secondary Student ', ' Secondary School Student ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' built environment ', ' arm movement ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' Big Data to Knowledge ', ' BD2K ', ' data to knowledge ', ' data into knowledge ', ' Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems ', ' electronic nicotine delivery device ', ' Longitudinal cohort study ', ' Longterm cohort study ', ' Long-term cohort study ', ' recruit ', ' sensor technology ', ' sensing technology ', ' wearable device ', ' wearable sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' body sensor ', ' Inhalation ', ' Inhaling ', ' cigarette user ', ' cigarette smoke ', ' Grain ', ' real time monitoring ', ' realtime monitoring ', ' Infrastructure ', ' tobacco products ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2019,121299,UT-02,0.026124656505164746

"ACTIVE: Abilities Captured Through Interactive Video Evaluation (DDT COA 000032) Project Summary/Abstract Technology has the potential to accelerate clinical research and reduce the burden of participation in rare diseases such as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). DMD is an x-linked genetic disorder that results in progressive muscle weakness with loss of ambulation by 10-12 years of age, progression of arm weakness resulting in difficulty with self-feeding and other self-care activities in adolescence, and death resulting from cardiopulmonary insufficiency by age 30 years. Studies in rare diseases are inherently difficult due to a small recruitment pool and a limited number of sites that possess the experience and resources to participate as a study site. An outcome measure that quantifies change in both ambulant and non-ambulant individuals with minimal evaluator training could enable more efficient data collection in multi-site clinical trials. Our upcoming submission, DDT COA 0032, Abilities Captured Through Interactive Video Evaluation (ACTIVE), has the potential to meet this need. ACTIVE is a 65-second game utilizing a skeletal-tracking algorithm to quantify workspace volume (WSV) elicited through maximal arm reaching overhead, side-to-side, and forward while also encouraging trunk lean in each direction. Our studies have shown that ACTIVE is valid and reliable in quantifying WSV in persons with DMD across the span of age and abilities. However, to increase access and portability of a tool for use across trial sites, it is critical that tool has sound scientific and technological construction. ACTIVE WSV was originally built upon the Microsoft Kinect and Kinect One for Xbox platforms. The skeletal tracking algorithm developed by Microsoft vastly exceeds all other programs as it had the full backing of the Microsoft machine. Unfortunately, the Kinect, in its additional sense, has been abandoned for more current artificial intelligence applications. The Microsoft Kinect Azure will soon be released with higher resolution and programming capabilities. Our full DDT submission has been delayed as each new camera release has required reprogramming of our software to ensure valid and reliable results. Our team has recently expanded to include software development partners, The Plan Works (thePlan), who have the technological expertise to alter our current codebase to ensure transfer of ACTIVE across camera sensor platforms is more efficient and reliable as we expect ongoing technological advances to provide opportunities for continued advances. To this end, our current application seeks support to verify the technology of the ACTIVE WSV system to 1) confirm the use of unique code that can be ported across platforms over time and 2) improving the ease of use and limit training needed at a growing number of inexperienced centers. Project Narrative Our upcoming submission, DDT COA 0032, Abilities Captured Through Interactive Video Evaluation (ACTIVE), is a 65-second outcome assessment that quantifies a person’s workspace volume and has the potential to expand the enrollment pool by measuring both ambulant and non-ambulant subjects. While the scientific construction of the tool is sound, ongoing technological advances and changes have made it challenging to port our software across camera platforms. Our proposal seeks funding to support final software updates to ensure changes in technology components (i.e. camera sensor systems) or coding instability will not interfere with clinical trial data collection and allow us to complete our final submission package.",ACTIVE: Abilities Captured Through Interactive Video Evaluation (DDT COA 000032),9989528,U01FD006883,[''],FDA,RESEARCH INST NATIONWIDE CHILDREN'S HOSP,U01,2019,215170,OH-03,0.0072744868753031044

"Novel use of mHealth data to identify states of vulnerability and receptivity to JITAIs Abstract: Smoking cessation decreases morbidity and mortality and is a cornerstone of cancer prevention. The ability to impact current and future vulnerability (e.g., high risk for a lapse) in real-time via engagement in self-regulatory activities (e.g., behavioral substitution, mindful attention) is considered an important pathway to quitting success. However, poor engagement represents a major barrier to maximizing the impact of self- regulatory activities. Hence, enhancing real-time, real-world engagement in evidence-based self-regulatory activities has the potential to improve the effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions. Just-In-Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) delivered via mobile devices have been developed for preventing and treating addictions. JITAIs adapt over time to an individual’s changing status and are optimized to provide appropriate intervention strategies based on real time, real world context. Organizing frameworks on JITAIs emphasize minimizing disruptions to the daily lives and routines of the individual, by tailoring strategies not only to vulnerability, but also to receptivity (i.e., an individual’s ability and willingness to utilize a particular intervention). Although both vulnerability and receptivity are considered latent states that are dynamically and constantly changing based on the constellation and temporal dynamics of emotions, context, and other factors, no attempt has been made to systematically investigate the nature of these states, as well as how knowledge of these states can be used to optimize real-time engagement in self-regulatory activities. To close this gap, the proposed project will apply innovative computational approaches to one of the most extensive and racially/ethnically diverse collection of real time, real world data on health behavior change (smoking cessation). Intensive longitudinal self-reported and sensor data from 5 studies (3 completed and 2 ongoing) of ~1,500 smokers attempting to quit will be analyzed with advanced probabilistic latent variable models and machine learning to investigate how the temporal dynamics and interactions of emotions, self-regulatory capacity (SRC), context, and other factors can be used to detect (Aim 1) states of vulnerability to a lapse and (Aim 2) states of receptivity to engaging in self-regulatory activities. We will also investigate (Aim 3) how knowledge of these states can be used to optimize real-time engagement in self-regulatory activities by conducting a Micro-Randomized Trial (MRT) enrolling 150 smokers attempting to quit. Utilizing a mobile smoking cessation app, the MRT will randomize each individual multiple times per day to either (a) no intervention prompt; (b) a prompt recommending engagement in brief (low effort) strategies; or (c) a prompt recommending a more effortful practice of self-regulation strategies. The proposed research will be the first to yield a comprehensive conceptual, technical, and empirical foundation necessary to develop effective JITAIs based on dynamic models of vulnerability and receptivity. Narrative: The current project proposes to advance the field of theory-driven behavior change interventions by investigating the dynamic role of distinct emotions, Self-Regulatory Capacity (SRC) and context in detecting vulnerability to lapse and receptivity to self-regulatory activities in smokers attempting to quit, as well as ascertaining the utility of these states in triggering real- time self-regulatory recommendations.",Novel use of mHealth data to identify states of vulnerability and receptivity to JITAIs,9768419,U01CA229437,"['Attention ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Boredom ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Emotions ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Maxim ', ' Aphorisms ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Play ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Smoking ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Societies ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' Measures ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' smoking cessation ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Smoker ', ' Depressed mood ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Location ', ' behavior change ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' success ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Cigarette ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Modeling ', ' craving ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' smoking cessation treatment ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Collection ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' willingness ', ' positive emotional state ', ' positive emotion ', ' coping ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Health behavior change ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' mobile device ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' mindfulness ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' mHealth ', ' mobile health ', ' m-Health ', ' field theory ', ' Learning Skill ', ' Formulation ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' adaptive intervention ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2019,606526,MI-12,0.00876817452773706

"Anatomy Directly from Imagery: General-purpose, Scalable, and Open-source Machine Learning Approaches Project Summary The form (or shape) and function relationship of anatomical structures is a central theme in biology where abnor- mal shape changes are closely tied to pathological functions. Morphometrics has been an indispensable quan- titative tool in medical and biological sciences to study anatomical forms for more than 100 years. Recently, the increased availability of high-resolution in-vivo images of anatomy has led to the development of a new generation of morphometric approaches, called statistical shape modeling (SSM), that take advantage of modern computa- tional techniques to model anatomical shapes and their variability within populations with unprecedented detail. SSM stands to revolutionize morphometric analysis, but its widespread adoption is hindered by a number of sig- niﬁcant challenges, including the complexity of the approaches and their increased computational requirements, relative to traditional morphometrics. Arguably, however, the most important roadblock to more widespread adop- tion is the lack of user-friendly and scalable software tools for a variety of anatomical surfaces that can be readily incorporated into biomedical research labs. The goal of this proposal is thus to address these challenges in the context of a ﬂexible and general SSM approach termed particle-based shape modeling (PSM), which automat- ically constructs optimal statistical landmark-based shape models of ensembles of anatomical shapes without relying on any speciﬁc surface parameterization. The proposed research will provide an automated, general- purpose, and scalable computational solution for constructing shape models of general anatomy. In Aim 1, we will build computational and machine learning algorithms to model anatomies with complex surface topologies (e.g., surface openings and shared boundaries) and highly variable anatomical populations. In Aim 2, we will introduce an end-to-end machine learning approach to extract statistical shape representation directly from im- ages, requiring no parameter tuning, image pre-processing, or user assistance. In Aim 3, we will provide intuitive graphical user interfaces and visualization tools to incorporate user-deﬁned modeling preferences and promote the visual interpretation of shape models. We will also make use of recent advances in cloud computing to enable researchers with limited computational resources and/or large cohorts to build and execute custom SSM work- ﬂows using remote scalable computational resources. Algorithmic developments will be thoroughly evaluated and validated using existing, fully funded, large-scale, and constantly growing databases of CT and MRI images lo- cated on-site. Furthermore, we will develop and disseminate standard workﬂows and domain-speciﬁc use cases for complex anatomies to promote reproducibility. Efforts to develop the proposed technology are aligned with the mission of the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS), and its third strategic goal: to bridge biology and quantitative science for better global health through supporting the development of and access to computational research tools for biomedical research. Our long-term goal is to increase the clinical utility and widespread adoption of SSM, and the proposed research will establish the groundwork for achieving this goal. Project Narrative This project will develop general-purpose, scalable, and open-source statistical shape modeling (SSM) tools, which will present unique capabilities for automated anatomy modeling with less user input. The proposed tech- nology will introduce a number of signiﬁcant improvements to current SSM approaches and tools, including the support for challenging modeling problems, inferring shapes directly from images (and hence bypassing the seg- mentation step), parallel optimizations for speed, and new user interfaces that will be much easier and scalable than the current tools. The proposed technology will constitute an indispensable resource for the biomedical and clinical communities that will enable new avenues for biomedical research and clinical investigations, provide new ways to answer biologically related questions, allow new types of questions to be asked, and open the door for the integration of SSM with clinical care.","Anatomy Directly from Imagery: General-purpose, Scalable, and Open-source Machine Learning Approaches",9803774,R01AR076120,"['Adoption ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Biological Sciences ', ' Life Sciences ', ' Bioscience ', ' Biologic Sciences ', ' Biology ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Cardiology ', ' Felis sylvestris catus ', ' Felis domesticus ', ' Felis domestica ', ' Feline Species ', ' Domestic Cats ', ' Cats Mammals ', ' Cats ', ' Felis catus ', ' Communities ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Computers ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Goals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Ice ', ' Laboratory Research ', ' Learning ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Mathematic Computing ', ' Math Computing ', ' Mathematical Computing ', ' Medicine ', ' Mission ', ' Anatomical Models ', ' Anatomic Models ', ' Modernization ', ' Morphogenesis ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Occupations ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' living system ', ' Organism ', ' Orthopedic Surgical Profession ', ' Orthopedic ', ' Orthopedics ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Science ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Computer Software Engineering ', ' Computer Software Development ', ' Software Engineering ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Software Tools ', ' Supervision ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Specialist ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Custom ', ' Imagery ', ' Visualization ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' biomedical resource ', ' image processing ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Surface ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' Intuition ', ' Visual ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Funding ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' particle ', ' cohort ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' Bypass ', ' Modeling ', ' software development ', ' developing computer software ', ' develop software ', ' model development ', ' Address ', ' global health ', ' Biological Testing ', ' Data ', ' National Institute of General Medical Sciences ', ' NIGMS ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Resolution ', ' Anatomic Surface ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Collection ', ' Computational Technique ', ' Pathologic ', ' Modification ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' Visualization software ', ' visualization tool ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' imaging Segmentation ', ' computing resources ', ' computational resources ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' image archival system ', ' picture archive ', ' image library ', ' image archive ', ' user-friendly ', ' open source ', ' graphical user interface ', ' graphic user interface ', ' Graphical interface ', ' usability ', ' clinical care ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' Cloud Computing ', ' cloud computer ', ' Cloud Infrastructure ', ' Geometry ', ' Complex Analysis ', ' in vivo imaging ', ' imaging in vivo ', ' clinical investigation ', ' deep learning ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' ']",NIAMS,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2019,631809,UT-02,0.003166599670387411
"CRCNS: The role of sound statistics for discrimination and coding of sounds ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Humans and other animals can discriminate and recognize sounds despite substantial acoustic variability in real-world sounds. This ability depends partly on the auditory system's ability to detect and utilize high-order statistical regularities that are present in the acoustic environment. Despite numerous advances in signal processing, assistive listening devices and speech recognition technologies lack biologically realistic strategies to dynamically deal with such acoustic variability. Thus, a comprehensive theory for how the central nervous system encodes and utilizes statistical structure in sounds is essential to develop processing strategies for sound recognition, coding and compression, and to assist individuals with hearing loss.     This proposal presents a novel approach towards addressing the question of how the auditory system deals with and exploits statistical regularities for identification and discrimination of sounds in two critical mammalian auditory structures (inferior colliculus, IC; auditory cortex, AC) Aim 1 is to develop a catalogue of natural and man-made sounds and their associated high-order statistics. Cluster analysis and machine learning will be applied to the sound ensembles to identify salient statistical features that can be used to identify and categorize sounds from a computational perspective. Using information theoretic and correlation based methods, Aim 2 tests the hypothesis that statistical sound regularities are encoded in neural response statistics, including firing rate and spike-timing statistics of IC and AC neurons. Aim 3 will determine neurometric response functions and addresses the hypothesis that high-order statistical regularities in sounds can be discriminated based on temporal pattern and firing rate statistics of single neurons in IC and AC. Aim 4 will employ multi-site recording electrode arrays to tests the hypothesis that neural populations in IC and AC use high-order statistics for sound discrimination and that statistical regularities are encoded by regionally distributed differences n the strength and timing of neural responses or neuron-to-neuron correlations.     The study will provide the groundwork for developing a general theory for how the brain encodes and discriminates sounds based on high-order statistical features. A catalogue of neural responses from single cells, neural ensembles, and high-level statistical features that differentiate real world sounds will be developed and deployed as an on-line resource. The role high-order statics play for sound recognition and discrimination will be identified both from a computational and neural coding perspective, including identifying transformations across neural structures, spatial and temporal scales.     The project will foster collaborations between psychology, electrical engineering, and biomedical engineering departments at the UConn. Graduate, undergraduate and a post-doctoral student, including women and minorities, will participate in the research and will receive interdisciplinary training in areas of neurophysiology, computation neuroscience, and engineering. Drs. Read and Escabi regularly host summer interns in their labs and expect that 1-2 undergraduate students will be hosted per year. Graduate students will be enrolled in biomedical, electrical engineering, and psychology programs. Project findings will be integrated in graduate computational neuroscience and biomedical engineering coursework.     The findings could lead to a host of new sound recognition technologies that make use of high-order statistical regularities to recognize and differentiate amongst sounds. Understanding how high-order statistics are represented in the brain could guide the development of optimal algorithms for detecting a target sound (e.g., speech) in variable/noisy conditions. Such sound recognition systems are also applicable in industrial applications: for instance, identifying fault machine systems from machine generated sounds.

"Using Machine Learning to Develop Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions for Smoking Cessation PROJECT SUMMARY Mobile technology has enormous potential for delivering highly innovative, dynamic smoking cessation interventions. Phone sensors, wearable technology, and real time data collection methods such as ecological momentary assessment (EMA) have made it possible to collect a wealth of environmental and physiological data such as location, heart rate, and mood. Environmental and situational cues such as craving and proximity to others smoking are highly predictive of lapse among those trying to quit, suggesting that lapse risk is characterized by immediate, dynamic influences. Emerging strategies such as just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAI), aim to prevent smoking lapse using tailored support delivered via mobile technology in the moments when it is most needed. Although research has identified antecedents of smoking lapse based on observations from EMA data, studies have been unable to utilize the full spectrum of contextual and environmental data available with current technology. Given the importance of dynamic influences on lapse risk, there is a critical need for strategies that accurately identify moments of highest lapse risk to improve cessation interventions. Recent research has demonstrated the utility of machine learning to predict individual behavior. Machine learning is a robust data analytic strategy that can produce highly accurate predictive models from large datasets and can automatically adapt to new data in real time. The overall objective of this application is to use supervised machine learning methods to develop an automated algorithm to quantify smoking lapse risk at the individual level. Specifically, we aim: 1) to apply supervised machine learning methods to quantify personalized risk of smoking lapse, and 2) to evaluate the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of delivering a personalized, just-in-time adaptive intervention driven by machine learning prediction of smoking lapse risk in real time. The proposed research and training plan will take place at The University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center (OUHSC) and the Stephenson Cancer Center (SCC). Training will focus on increasing knowledge of machine learning methodology, and the conduct and analysis of JITAIs, which will facilitate completion of the proposed project. Results of the proposed research have the potential to reduce the amount and frequency of data needed from participants and sensors, enabling the development of less burdensome interventions. It is expected that completion of these aims will yield preliminary data to inform an automated, dynamic intervention that fully utilizes the strengths of mobile technology for measuring individual behavior and environmental context in real time. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will be among the first to use machine learning methods to predict risk of individual smoking lapse in real time. The resulting algorithm will provide a personalized model for each participant that adapts to new data and triggers the delivery of a tailored, precision intervention when it is most needed. If successful, this project and its methodology could be adapted to target other health behaviors such as diet, physical activity, or other substance use disorders.",Using Machine Learning to Develop Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions for Smoking Cessation,9583421,K99DA046564,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Behavior ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Control Groups ', ' Cues ', ' Data Collection ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Health behavior ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Moods ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Oklahoma ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Smoking ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Technology ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Wrist ', ' Measures ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Frequencies ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Modeling ', ' craving ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Car Phone ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' smoking cessation treatment ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Research Training ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Smoking Behavior ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' standard care ', ' standard treatment ', ' mobile application ', ' mobile app ', ' personalized intervention ', ' precision interventions ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' mobile computing ', ' mobile technology ', ' mobile platform ', ' Data Analytics ', ' wearable technology ', ' Accelerometer ', ' activity tracker ', ' activity monitor ', ' accelerometry ', ' secondary analysis ', ' wearable device ', ' wearable sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' body sensor ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' adaptive intervention ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA HLTH SCIENCES CTR,K99,2019,92213,OK-05,-0.0030825537127771923
"A framework for developing translatable intelligent neural interface systems for precision neuromodulation therapies Despite advances in neuromodulation technology, therapeutic devices are often ineffective or have adverse side effects. Next-generation closed-loop neuromodulation systems will provide great potentials for improving the therapeutic outcome by sensing the neural states and adapting the neuromodulatory actions. These systems will provide powerful tools for understanding the mechanisms of treatment by elucidating the causal link between regulating the physiological states and the therapeutic or the behavioral outcomes. However, a lack of systematic approach to optimally control neurostimulation is a major barrier to fully utilize their potentials. Furthermore, the real-time implementation of advanced optimization and control algorithms requires powerful computing hardware that pose a major challenge for translating the effective neural interface systems into implantable or wearable devices with limited power supply. The proposed project is addressing these two problems by developing an open-source end-to-end platform, called NeuroWeaver, to design, test and deploy intelligent Closed-Loop Neuromodulation (iCLON) systems that automatically can learn the optimal neuromodulation control policies by interacting with the nervous system. We cast the problem of optimizing neuromodulation into reward-based learning where achieving the desired neural state or the therapeutic outcome represents a measure of reward for the iCLON system. We will use techniques from reinforcement learning and model predictive control to develop algorithms that enable iCLON systems learn the optimal actions to maximize their reward. Memory dysfunction is one of the most devastating symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease and age-related dementia. We will develop the NeuroWeaver platform in the context of designing iCLON systems to induce good memory states in the hippocampus by closed-loop amygdala stimulation. Optimizing the memory- enhancing effects of amygdala stimulation will have immediate benefits to research on treatments for memory disorders. More broadly, the NeuroWeaver platform can be combined with a wide range of biological sensors and actuators to design intelligent closed-loop control systems for regulating physiological processes far beyond the proposed application in this proposal. Our proposed platform will have the potential to create an open-source ecosystem for collaboration between machine learning, neuroscience, and computer architecture communities as well as provide tools for further enrichment of the algorithms and broader utilization in the biomedical domain. The goal of this project is developing a platform for designing therapeutic devices with artificial intelligence to enable automatic optimization of neuromodulation for precision therapies. We will develop this platform in the context of closed-loop optimization of amygdala stimulation for memory enhancement, one of the most devastating symptoms of the Alzheimer’s disease and age-related dementia.",A framework for developing translatable intelligent neural interface systems for precision neuromodulation therapies,9802681,R01EB028350,"['Acceleration ', ' Algorithms ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdala ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Behavior ', ' Communities ', ' Computer Architectures ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' Goals ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hippocampus ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' indwelling device ', ' implant device ', ' biomedical implant ', ' implantable device ', ' Intelligence ', ' Intelligence Tests ', ' Learning ', ' Libraries ', ' Memory ', ' Cognitive Retention Disorders ', ' Memory Disorders ', ' Neurologic Organ System ', ' Neurologic Body System ', ' Nervous System ', ' Nervous system structure ', ' neurophysiological ', ' neurophysiology ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Patients ', ' Physiologic Processes ', ' Organismal Process ', ' Organism-Level Process ', ' Physiological Processes ', ' Power Supplies ', ' Power Sources ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Rat ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Rattus ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Research ', ' Rewards ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Custom ', ' Ecosystem ', ' Ecological Systems ', ' Ecologic Systems ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Link ', ' Memory impairment ', ' memory dysfunction ', ' Memory Deficit ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Collaborations ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Dependence ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' Performance ', ' neuroregulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neural regulation ', ' neural control ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Biosensor ', ' biological sensor ', ' Devices ', ' Modeling ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' in vivo ', ' therapy outcome ', ' therapeutic outcome ', ' Behavioral ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' computer algorithm ', ' open source ', ' prototype ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' biological systems ', ' Precision therapeutics ', ' precision treatment ', ' precision therapies ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' wearable device ', ' wearable sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' body sensor ', ' in vivo evaluation ', ' in vivo testing ', ' Infrastructure ', ' side effect ', ' ']",NIBIB,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,436002,GA-05,-0.010808772014839582
"User-driven Retrospectively Supervised Classification Updating (RESCU) system for robust upper limb prosthesis control ABSTRACT Approximately 41,000 individuals live with upper-limb loss (loss of at least one hand) in the US. Fortunately, prosthetic devices have advanced considerably in the past decades with the development of dexterous, anthropomorphic hands. However, potentially the most promising used control strategy, myoelectric control, lacks a correspondingly high-level of performance and hence the use of dexterous hands remains highly limited. The need for a complete overhaul in upper limb prosthesis control is well highlighted by the abandonment rates of myoelectric devices, which can reach up to 40% in the case of trans-humeral amputees. The area of research that has received the most focus over the past decade has been “pattern recognition,” which is a signal processing based control method that uses multi-channel surface electromyography as the control input. While pattern recognition provides intuitive operation of multiple prosthetic degrees of freedom, it lacks robustness and requires frequent, often daily calibration. Thus, it has not yet achieved the desired clinical acceptance. Our team proposes clinical translation of a novel highly adaptive upper limb prosthesis control system that incorporates two major advances: 1) machine learning (robust classification by implementing a non-boundary based algorithm), and 2) training by retrospectively incorporating user data from activities of daily living (ADL). The proposed system will enable machine intelligence with user input for prosthesis control. Our work is organized as follows: Phase I: (a) First, we will implement a fundamentally new machine intelligence technique, Extreme Learning Machine with Adaptive Sparse Representation Classification (EASRC), that is more resilient to untrained noisy conditions that users may encounter in the real-world and requires less data than traditional myoelectric signal processing. (b) In parallel, we will implement an adaptive learning algorithm, Nessa, which allows users to relabel misclassified data recorded during use and then update the EASRC classifier to adapt to any major extrinsic or intrinsic changes in the signals. Taken together, EASRC and Nessa comprise the Retrospectively Supervised Classification Updating (RESCU) system. Once, the RESCU implementation is complete, we will optimize the system through a joint effort with Johns Hopkins University, and complete an iterative benchtop RESCU evaluation with a focus group of 3 amputee subjects and their prosthetists. Phase II: Verification and validation of RESCU will be completed, culminating in third-party validation testing and certification. Finally, we will complete a clinical assessment including self-reporting subjective measures, and real-world usage metrics in a long-term clinical study. PROJECT NARRATIVE In this project, we aim to empower the user by bringing them into the control loop of their prosthesis and improve the stability of their control strategy over time. Specifically, we implement to a robust classifier, an adaptive learning algorithm, and a smartwatch interface, which allows the user to teach their device when it misunderstands the commands that the user is sending to control the prosthesis. This will result in improved control without cumbersome or time-consuming effort on the part of the user and, more importantly, we hope that it will give the user a greater sense of empowerment and ownership over their prosthesis.",User-driven Retrospectively Supervised Classification Updating (RESCU) system for robust upper limb prosthesis control,10013405,U44NS108894,"['Activities of Daily Living ', ' functional capacity ', ' functional ability ', ' daily living functionality ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' Adoption ', ' Algorithms ', ' Amputees ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Calibration ', ' Certification ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Communication ', ' Electromyography ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Liberty ', ' Freedom ', ' Goals ', ' Hand ', ' Joints ', ' Methods ', ' Ownership ', ' Research ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Supervision ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Prosthesis ', ' Prosthetics ', ' Prosthetic device ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Surface ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Intuition ', ' Individual ', ' satisfaction ', ' Systems Integration ', ' Limb Prosthesis ', ' prosthetic limb ', ' Artificial Limbs ', ' Artificial Extremities ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Performance ', ' novel ', ' empowerment ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Devices ', ' Upper Extremity ', ' Upper Limb ', ' Membrum superius ', ' Data ', ' Pattern Recognition ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' SBIR ', ' Update ', ' Validation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' Consumption ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' functional improvement ', ' function improvement ', ' verification and validation ', ' operation ', ' signal processing ', ' prosthesis control ', ' prosthetic control ', ' myoelectric control ', ' adaptive learning ', ' clinical translation ', ' smart watch ', ' smartwatch ', ' learning algorithm ', ' ']",NINDS,"INFINITE BIOMEDICAL TECHNOLOGIES, LLC",U44,2019,735600,MD-07,0.05067815640548454
"Socioeconomic status, stress, and smoking cessation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The prevalence of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) is rising dramatically among both adults and youth and ENDS use is fast becoming a major public health issue. However, because of their recent emergence, researchers know little about ENDS, their use, their effects on human physiology and health, their risks and benefits, or their impact on tobacco control efforts. A common barrier to studying ENDS is the lack of data on objective, real world use of ENDS. Thus, the proposed project aims to adapt existing innovative mobile assessment tools that can be used to target critical ENDS research gaps by providing mobile sensing technology that can objectively collect precise data regarding ENDS use in real time in real world. Specifically, the proposed revision project will expand the scope of Project On Track (1R01CA190329-01A1, PI: Wetter) by extending the application of puffMarker, an existing tool that automatically detects smoking, for the assessment of ENDS use. The current project has three aims: 1) adapt and validate puffMarker to identify discrete episodes of ENDS use, 2) adapt and validate puffMarker to distinguish between cigarette smoking and ENDS use among dual users of ENDS and cigarettes, and 3) utilize the Project On Track protocol to collect real time, real world data investigating potential determinants of ENDS use among both exclusive ENDS users as well as dual users of cigarettes and ENDS. Altogether, 120 participants (30 for Aim 1, 30 for Aim 2, and 60 for Aim 3) will be enrolled. Participants recruited for Aims 1 and 2 will attend laboratory (three 2-hour sessions) and field (3 days) studies. In the laboratory sessions, participants will wear the AutoSense wireless sensors and be asked to use ENDS (Aim 1) or use ENDS and smoke a cigarette (Aim 2). Participants' ENDS and cigarette puffs will be recorded by an independent observer. In the field studies, participants will wear the AutoSense wireless sensors and be asked to use ENDS (Aim 1) or use ENDS and smoke cigarettes (Aim 2). Participants will be asked to record each instance of ENDS use or cigarette smoking on a SP. The goals of the laboratory studies are to collect data to train puffMarker to identify ENDS use and to distinguish between cigarette smoking and ENDS use. The goal of the field studies is to validate puffMarker in real-life, natural environments. Aim 3 will utilize the Project On Track protocol to collect the first real time, real world data on ENDS and dual use. Participants will be assessed for 6 days using AutoSense, EMA, and GPS to examine potential determinants of ENDS use. A validated puffMarker that detects ENDS use and distinguishes between ENDS use and smoking can enhance many areas of research inquiry on ENDS. Knowledge learned from Aim 3 will be essential for the development of comprehensive conceptual models with respect to ENDS use and smoking cessation. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project aims to develop an innovative tool that targets important ENDS research gaps by offer- ing researchers the latest mobile sensing technology to objectively collect precise data regarding ENDS use and distinguish between ENDS use and smoking in real time and in real world.","Socioeconomic status, stress, and smoking cessation",9754578,R01CA190329,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Algorithms ', ' Breathing ', ' inspiration ', ' Respiratory Inspiration ', ' Respiratory Aspiration ', ' Behavior ', ' Environment ', ' Geography ', ' Gestures ', ' Goals ', ' Hand ', ' Health ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Laboratories ', ' body movement ', ' Movement ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Physiology ', ' Public Health ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Stress ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Wrist ', ' Measures ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' smoking cessation ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Series ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Training ', ' Oral cavity ', ' Mouth ', ' Cavitas Oris ', ' Buccal Cavity Head and Neck ', ' Buccal Cavity ', ' Individual ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' cigarette use ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' participant recruitment ', ' uptake ', ' tool ', ' Smoker ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' respiratory ', ' psychosocial ', ' experience ', ' field study ', ' field test ', ' field learning ', ' field based data ', ' Cigarette ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Harm Reduction ', ' Harm Minimization ', ' Laboratory Study ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Chest ', ' Thorax ', ' Thoracic ', ' Thorace ', ' Modeling ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Wireless Technology ', ' wireless ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' tobacco control ', ' biobehavior ', ' biobehavioral ', ' systems research ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Abstinence ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' parent grant ', ' primary outcome ', ' population health ', ' High School Student ', ' Secondary Student ', ' Secondary School Student ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' built environment ', ' arm movement ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' Big Data to Knowledge ', ' BD2K ', ' data to knowledge ', ' data into knowledge ', ' Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems ', ' electronic nicotine delivery device ', ' Longitudinal cohort study ', ' Longterm cohort study ', ' Long-term cohort study ', ' recruit ', ' sensor technology ', ' sensing technology ', ' wearable device ', ' wearable sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' body sensor ', ' Inhalation ', ' Inhaling ', ' cigarette user ', ' cigarette smoke ', ' Grain ', ' real time monitoring ', ' realtime monitoring ', ' Infrastructure ', ' tobacco products ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2019,581251,UT-02,0.026124656505164746
"Enabling of a Wireless and Remotely Monitored Deep Brain Stimulation System through the Internet of Medical Things for Parkinson's Disease Patients Project Summary The objective of this project is to demonstrate feasibility of a novel platform technology using ultrasonic waves for wireless bidirectional real-time communication and powering of a Bilateral Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) system with remote patient monitoring. DBS has become an established neurosurgical procedure with over 160,000 patients treated worldwide. DBS has been shown to improve Parkinson's disease (PD) patient quality of life, increase long term tremor control, reduce dyskinesia, and reduce hyperdopaminergic behavioral symptoms. Some of the most common complications associated with this procedure are injury caused by wire/lead tunneling, erosions or infections of the tunneled wires, lead failure/migration, and tethering of extension cables. None of the current solutions are leadless and allow for remote monitoring due to limitations of wireless interconnected devices in the body. Bionet Sonar's software-defined UsWB proprietary technology is capable of transmitting energy and data via ultrasonic waves through tissue, bone, and fluids at penetration depths significantly higher than RF waves and with greater reliability. The Bionet platform includes: i) Reprogrammable wireless stimulation leads; ii) Rechargeable system controller to coordinate with, recharge, and reprogram other implantable elements of the network through the ultrasonic interface; iii) External recharging and communication patch to act as a power/data gateway to interconnect the intra-body network with the Internet. An intelligent DBS device that can be monitored by clinicians and provide feedback control to optimize therapy using remote continuous real-time data will lead to improved PD treatment options and informed treatment decisions individualized for each patient (point-of-care). In this Phase I study, feasibility for wireless power and remote monitoring with the Bionet system will be demonstrated by completing the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. Demonstrate in vitro feasibility of controlled deep brain stimulation, recharging and remote monitoring components using ultrasonic waves at typical implantable tissue depths. Specific Aim 2. Demonstrate in vivo, data and energy transmission for the systems during controlled stimulation of the brain. In vivo experiments in minipig models (n=3) will be used to demonstrate the ability of the system to transmit data and energy from the subcutaneous controller to the pacing nodes using closed loop control based on real time electrical sensing. This proposal leverages the strengths of Bionet Sonar Inc. and the University of Louisville. Our long-term goal is to successfully translate the Bionet Sonar system into clinical practice. The core platform technology may also be applied to other networked systems for the treatment of diverse etiologies opening a new frontier in multimodal patient treatment and use of Artificial Intelligence for patient care. Project Narrative Through this proposal a wireless remotely monitored deep brain stimulation system will be developed using new core technology for the Internet of Medical Things. Ultrasonic wideband technology will be used to enable wireless communication and recharging of the different implantable elements, allowing for miniaturization and energy efficiency. This technology will not only improve the outcomes and healthcare economics of the Parkinson's disease patient population, but may also enable other innovative therapies in other

"Adaptive & Individualized AAC The heterogeneity of the more than 1.3% of Americans who suffer from severe physical impairments (SPIs) preclude the use of common augmentative or alternative communication (AAC) solutions such as manual signs, gestures or dexterous interaction with a touchscreen for communication. While efforts to develop alternative access methods through eye or head tracking have provided some communication advancements for these individuals, all current technologies suffer from the same fundamental limitation: existing AAC devices require patients to conform to generic communication access methods and interfaces rather than the device conforming to the user. Consequently, AAC users are forced to settle for interventions that require excessive training and cognitive workload only to deliver extremely slow information transfer rates (ITRs) and recurrent communication errors that ultimately deprive them of the fundamental human right of communication. To meet this health need, we propose the first smart-AAC system designed using individually adaptive access methods and AAC interfaces to accommodate the unique manifestations of motor impairments specific to each user. Preliminary research by our team of speech researchers at Madonna Rehabilitation Hospital (Communication Center Lab) and Boston University (STEPP Lab), utilizing wearable sensors developed by our group (Altec, Inc) have already demonstrated that metrics based on surface electromyographic (sEMG) and accelerometer measures of muscle activity and movement for head-mediated control can be combined with optimizable AAC interfaces to improve ITRs when compared with traditional unoptimized AAC devices. Leveraging this pilot work, our team is now proposing a Phase I project to demonstrate the proof-of-concept that a single sEMG/IMU hybrid sensor worn on the forehead can provide improvements in ITR and communication accuracy when integrated with an AAC interface that is optimized through machine learning algorithms. The prototype system will be tested and compared to a conventional (non-adaptable) interface in subjects with SPI at a collaborative clinical site. Assistance by our speech and expert-AAC collaborators will ensure that all phases of technology development are patient-centric and usable in the context of clinical care. In Phase II we will build upon this proof-of-concept to design a smart-AAC system with automated optimization software that achieves dynamic learning which adapts to intra-individual changes in function through disease progression or training as well as inter-individual differences in motor impairments for a diverse set of users with spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury, cerebral palsy, ALS, and other SPIs. The innovation is the first and only AAC technology that combines advancements in wearable-sensor access with interfaces that are autonomously optimized to the user, thereby reducing the resources and training needed to achieve effective person-centric communication in SPI, through improved HMI performance and reduced workload. This project addresses the fundamental mission of NIDCD (National Institute for Deafness and Communication Disorders) to provide a direct means of assisting communication for people with severe physical impairments caused by stroke, high level spinal cord injury, neural degeneration, or neuromuscular disease. Leveraging wearable access technology (which has barely been explored for AAC users), we will develop a first-of-its-kind adaptive tablet interface tailored to individual users through advanced movement classification algorithms. Through these efforts, we aim to provide an improved Human Machine Interface (HMI) that is able to accommodate varying degrees of inter- and intra-subject residual motor function and context dependent impairments to provide individuals with SPI the opportunity for improved societal integration and quality of life.",Adaptive & Individualized AAC,9907832,R43DC018437,"['Boston ', ' Cerebral Palsy ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communication ', ' Communicative Disorders ', ' Communication Disorders ', ' Communication impairment ', ' deafness ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye ', ' Facial Muscles ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Fatigue ', ' Forehead ', ' Gestures ', ' Goals ', ' Head ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human Rights ', ' Hybrids ', ' Institutes ', ' Learning ', ' Linguistic ', ' Linguistics ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' body movement ', ' Movement ', ' muscular ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' Muscle ', ' Persons ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' neurological degeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' neuromuscular disorder ', ' neuromuscular degenerative disorder ', ' myoneural disorder ', ' Neuromuscular Diseases ', ' Patients ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' rehabilitative therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Speech ', ' Traumatic Myelopathy ', ' Spinal cord injuries ', ' Spinal cord injured ', ' Spinal Trauma ', ' Spinal Cord Trauma ', ' Spinal cord injury ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Stroke ', ' Tablets ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' man machine interface ', ' human machine interface ', ' human computer interface ', ' User-Computer Interface ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Work Load ', ' Workload ', ' Mediating ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Surface ', ' Residual state ', ' Residual ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Series ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Intuition ', ' Individual ', ' Disease Progression ', ' United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration ', ' National Aeronautics and Space Administration ', ' NASA ', ' Head Movements ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' American ', ' Performance ', ' technology development ', ' tech development ', ' kinematics ', ' kinematic model ', ' novel ', ' Communication Methods ', ' Devices ', ' Imaging problem ', ' Traumatic Brain Injury ', ' traumatic brain damage ', ' Brain Trauma ', ' mathematical model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematic model ', ' Math Models ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Motor Manifestations ', ' Address ', ' Motor ', ' Cognitive ', ' Text ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders ', ' NIDCD ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' touchscreen ', ' touchscreen panel ', ' touch screen panel ', ' touch screen ', ' touch panel ', ' alternative communication ', ' clinical research site ', ' clinical site ', ' Individual Differences ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Impairment ', ' two-dimensional ', ' 2-dimensional ', ' rehabilitation engineering ', ' rehab engineering ', ' motor impairment ', ' movement limitation ', ' movement impairment ', ' prototype ', ' clinical care ', ' rehabilitation science ', ' signal processing ', ' Accelerometer ', ' activity tracker ', ' activity monitor ', ' accelerometry ', ' communication device ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' sensor technology ', ' sensing technology ', ' wearable device ', ' wearable sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' body sensor ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' classification algorithm ', ' ']",NIDCD,"ALTEC, INC.",R43,2019,224701,MA-05,-0.029342513788333482
"Graphene-based Nanosensor Device for Rapid, Onsite Detection of Total Lead in Tap Water PROJECT SUMMARY Detrimental health impacts of lead are largely attributed to long-term exposures to undetected lead, which are particularly troublesome and problematic because of the neurological damage to children, a situation that should not be tolerated by an advanced society like the U.S. The Flint Water Crisis and many other water catastrophes could have been avoided if early warning can be made possible through timely detection of lead in drinking water at the point of use. Our extensive customer interviews unambiguously suggest that current options for lead detection are unsatisfactory for on-site testing, as they represent two extremes: one being accurate but expensive, slow, and hard to use; and the other being low-cost, fast, and easy to use but inaccurate. NanoAffix Science LLC (NAFX) proposes to address the above unmet need and niche market product gap by empowering water users (particularly those in economically disadvantaged communities) and water service providers with a low-cost, easy-to-use, and accurate handheld tester for rapid detection of total lead in the tap water, right from the kitchen sink. The handheld lead tester combines a novel proprietary micro-sized sensor chip embedded in a proprietary test cell with a portable digital meter for direct readout of testing results. The Phase I project has successfully established the feasibility for detection of soluble lead in the tap water using an earlier version of the prototype handheld tester. The Phase II project will continue to develop the handheld tester toward total lead detection, better device uniformity, pilot scale-up manufacturing, and accurate calibration. At the end of the Phase II project, NAFX plans to produce 20 beta units of the handheld lead tester meeting all performance specifications for field validation by 10 initial customers (e.g., schools/daycares, end water users, and well water drillers). Major innovations of the proposed approach include accurate prediction of the particulate lead through partial digestion based on lead digestion kinetics, and strategic and synergistic improvement of the ultimate sensor prediction accuracy by (1) improving the physical sensor device uniformity (both intra-wafer and inter-wafer) through innovative device configuration and rigorous quality control; and (2) improving the calibration accuracy through innovative theoretical equilibrium chemistry modeling and machine learning data analytics. The NAFX handheld lead tester is the first of its kind to (1) offer all three features sought by customers: accurate, cheap, and fast; and (2) to simultaneously report all three types of lead: total lead (indicative of overall toxicity), soluble lead (indicative of slow leaching of lead), and particulate lead (indicative of sporadic flaking of lead), which thus can not only alert customers to the lead hazard in their drinking water but also enable customers to identify possible causes and most effective solutions to mitigate the lead contamination. Therefore, the project will result in not only considerable economic impact but also immense societal impact. The regular use of NAFX handheld tester - even if intermittently - will virtually eliminate the chance of chronic exposure to undetected lead, thereby accruing significant and predictable public health impact, especially in locations with the highest risk. PROJECT NARRATIVE The NanoAffix Phase II project aims to continue the development of a handheld lead tester for accurate and low- cost onsite detection of total lead in tap water by untrained users, based on the success of the Phase I project. The project will contribute to enhancing the public health by offering an accessible tool for quantitative monitoring of all three types of lead: total lead (indicative of overall toxicity), soluble lead (indicative of slow leaching of lead), and particulate lead (indicative of sporadic flaking of lead) in tap water. The regular use of NanoAffix handheld tester - even if intermittently - will virtually eliminate the chance of chronic exposure to undetected lead, thereby accruing significant and predictable public health impact, especially in locations with the highest risk.","Graphene-based Nanosensor Device for Rapid, Onsite Detection of Total Lead in Tap Water",9847052,R44ES028656,"['Algorithms ', ' Calibration ', ' Cations ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Chemistry ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Digestion ', ' Disinfection ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Equipment ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' Interview ', ' Kinetics ', ' Laboratories ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' toxicity to lead ', ' toxic effect to lead ', ' lead toxicity ', ' lead toxic effect ', ' lead poisonings ', ' Pb2+ toxic effect ', ' Pb2+ poisoning ', ' Pb2+ lead toxicity ', ' Pb2+ Toxicity ', ' Pb toxicity ', ' Pb toxic effect ', ' Pb poisoning ', ' Pb lead toxicity ', ' Lead Poisoning ', ' Michigan ', ' Paper ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality Control ', ' Research ', ' Schools ', ' Science ', ' Societies ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Water ', ' Water Supply ', ' Specialist ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' sample collection ', ' specimen collection ', ' Site ', ' Chronic ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Training ', ' Measurement ', ' Exposure to ', ' Contracts ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Test Result ', ' Particulate ', ' meter ', ' meetings ', ' empowered ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' water quality ', ' hazard ', ' drinking water ', ' aqueous ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Toxicities ', ' novel ', ' economic impact ', ' Economically Deprived Population ', ' underclass ', ' economically disadvantaged ', ' economic disadvantage ', ' Economically Deprived ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Nervous System Trauma ', ' neurotrauma ', ' Neurological trauma ', ' Neurological Injury ', ' Neurological Damage ', ' Nervous System damage ', ' Nervous System Injuries ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' portability ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' International ', ' Validation ', ' Wireless Technology ', ' wireless ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cost ', ' virtual ', ' digital ', ' rapid detection ', ' lead concentration ', ' Pb concentration ', ' lead contamination ', ' lead contaminated ', ' contamination to lead ', ' contaminated to lead ', ' Pb2+ contamination ', ' Pb2+ contaminated ', ' Pb contamination ', ' Pb contaminated ', ' nanosensors ', ' nanosensing ', ' nano sensors ', ' nano sensing ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' prototype ', ' high risk ', ' manufacturing scale-up ', ' operation ', ' Data Analytics ', ' graphene ', ' service providers ', ' real time monitoring ', ' realtime monitoring ', ' well water ', ' ']",NIEHS,"NANOAFFIX SCIENCE, LLC",R44,2019,565059,WI-04,0.021136458533207825
"A Federated Galaxy for user-friendly large-scale cancer genomics research Project Summary Cancer research is now a data-driven discipline, but only a minority of cancer researchers are data scientists. This severely restricts our ability to effectively study and cure the disease. The far reaching significance of our project is in federating disparate data and computational resources in order to provide a unifying analysis platform for computational cancer research.  We will extend the popular scientific workbench Galaxy (https://galaxyproject.org) so that it can integrate with distributed data and compute resources used and needed by cancer researchers, including those resources in the NCI Cancer Research Data Commons (NCR DC). Our Federated Galaxy system will allow users to seamlessly access NCR DC data across multiple resources. It will support multiple analysis scenarios tuned to skills and computational requirements of individual researchers.  The aims of this project are: Aim 1. Extend Galaxy for working with distributed cancer genomics and phenotypic data. This will enable Galaxy users to access both public and private cancer data regardless of their actual physical location. Best-practice approaches will be used for accessing restricted datasets.  Aim 2. Enhance Galaxy for context-aware, distributed cancer genomics analyses using shared workflow representations. This will enable Galaxy users to run genomics analyses on different clouds, ultimately reducing the time, cost, and data transfer associated with analyses.  Aim 3. Apply Federated Galaxy to precision oncology research. Workflows developed in this aim will leverage the technologies in Aims 1 and 2 to benchmark machine learning algorithms for predicting tumor phenotype and drug response. Interactive reports will summarize benchmarking results and utilize ITCR visualizations for deep dives into results.  Our system will provide a singular access point to distributed cancer datasets and will enable these data to be analyzed within a single portal in a way that satisfies multiple analysis scenarios and utilizes diverse computational resources. Finally, a cloud-centric Galaxy built for the NCR DC will substantially grow the community of users working with the GDC and the NCR DC. This is because Galaxy brings with itself a vibrant world-wide community of users and developers, which numbers tens of thousands of scientists. These individuals will help to tune the GDC and other resources within the NCR DC to the needs of real-life analysis scenarios and will enrich the set of tools accessible to cancer researchers. Project Narrative This project will develop a user-friendly scientific analysis workbench for analyzing cancer genomics data on the NCI Cancer Research Data Commons cloud platform. The workbench will democratize access to cloud-based cancer genomic analyses. It will also aid in precision cancer medicine by benchmarking and identifying the most accurate analytic methods for classifying tumors and predicting drug response.",A Federated Galaxy for user-friendly large-scale cancer genomics research,9783755,U24CA231877,"['Awareness ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Communities ', ' Community Developments ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Sources ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Health ', ' Language ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Maps ', ' Names ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' Oregon ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Privatization ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Running ', ' Standardization ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Imagery ', ' Visualization ', ' analytical method ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Galaxy ', ' Internet ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Scientist ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Services ', ' empowered ', ' Informatics ', ' skills ', ' Reporting ', ' response ', ' Proteomics ', ' Genomics ', ' Data ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Metadata ', ' meta data ', ' Output ', ' cancer genomics ', ' oncogenomics ', ' cost ', ' anticancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' distributed data ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' Minority ', ' computing resources ', ' computational resources ', ' user-friendly ', ' web interface ', ' tumor ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' cloud based ', ' precision oncology ', ' precision cancer medicine ', ' precision cancer care ', ' personalized oncology ', ' individualized cancer care ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' Data Analytics ', ' multiple omics ', ' multiomics ', ' phenotypic data ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' cloud platform ', ' cloud server ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic dataset ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomics cloud ', ' Genomic Data Commons ', ' data resource ', ' drug response prediction ', ' Predict drug response ', ' Infrastructure ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' Data Scientist ', ' computational platform ', ' computing platform ', ' ']",NCI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,U24,2019,752490,OR-03,-0.004869970668974353
"The role of ENDS use in changing rates of escalation and quitting of cigarette smoking in those under age 35 years in US population Abstract Recently, there has been extensive use of Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS) by young people in the United States (US). These products have the potential to significantly reduce the proportion of young adults who are addicted to cigarette smoking, either by influencing the proportion who escalate to daily cigarette smoking or by increasing the proportion who quit under the age of 35 years. Previous research has demonstrated that there are two groups of escalators to daily cigarette smoking: 1) early escalators who are daily smokers before age 20 years, and 2) later escalators (become daily smokers at 21+ years). This proposal will explore the long-term role of ENDS in changing the escalation and quitting of cigarette smoking using the first four waves of the national Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) longitudinal study. The study used a four stage stratified area probability design and has enrolled ~26,000 people under the age of 35 years, half of whom were female. The public use data for the first two waves are available and include longitudinal weighting variables. Wave 3 is expected to be publicly available in Spring 2018, and Wave 4 one is expected year later. The weighted response for Wave 2 was 87% for 12-17 year olds, and 83% for adults. With these PATH data, we will explore two scientific premises: 1) that widespread promotion of ENDS has resulted in a new generation of nicotine users who rely on ENDS usage and who did not escalate to daily cigarette smokers when becoming adults; and 2) that the diffusion of ENDS among young tobacco users will result in lower nicotine dependence that, in turn, will be associated with higher rates of successful discontinuance of cigarette smoking before age 35 years. A significant methodological weakness in such complex longitudinal analyses is related to the consideration of a large number of time-varying confounding variables that are prognostic for changes in tobacco use behaviors and are also associated with the outcome of interest. Some epidemiological methods allow the achievement of covariate balance between different exposure groups. With these methods, ongoing differences in outcomes of interest are directly attributable to ENDS usage, for example. In this context, we leverage Propensity Score Matching (PSM), and Marginal Structural Models (MSMs) to adjust for time-varying confounding. We will also explore Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE) techniques to optimize the performance of PSM. We will conduct separate analyses for early escalators, late escalators, and quitters before age 35 years. This proposal will answer an urgent public health question in regards to the long-term potential benefits associated with ENDS usage, while also providing an example to the tobacco research field of state-of-art epidemiological methods for complex longitudinal analyses. Project Narrative Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS) appear to be changing the product pattern through which young people become nicotine dependent. Using the first four waves from the national Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study, we will investigate whether ENDS use changes the pattern of escalation and early quitting among those less than 35 years in the United States.",The role of ENDS use in changing rates of escalation and quitting of cigarette smoking in those under age 35 years in US population,9782867,R01CA234539,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Behavior ', ' Epidemiologic Confounding Factor ', ' Confounding Variables ', ' Confounding Factors (Epidemiology) ', ' Data Collection ', ' Diffusion ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Methods Epidemiology ', ' Epidemiological Techniques ', ' Epidemiological Methods ', ' Epidemiologic Methods ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Escalator ', ' Family ', ' Female ', ' Health ', ' longterm study ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Structural Models ', ' Nicotine ', ' nicotine dependent ', ' nicotine addiction ', ' Nicotine Dependence ', ' Perception ', ' Probability ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Smoking ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' United States ', ' Weight ', ' Estimation Techniques ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' smoking cessation ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Area ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' prognostic ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' cigarette use ', ' Exposure to ', ' Smoker ', ' Cigarette Smoker ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Tobacco Use Cessation ', ' Tobacco Cessation ', ' Cigarette ', ' peer ', ' Categories ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Smoking Behavior ', ' Smoking Status ', ' Monitor ', ' tobacco advertising ', ' tobacco marketing ', ' tobacco ads ', ' comparison group ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' 12 year old ', ' twelve years of age ', ' twelve year old ', ' age 12 years ', ' 12 years of age ', ' 17 year old ', ' seventeen years of age ', ' seventeen year old ', ' age 17 years ', ' 17 years of age ', ' 18 year old ', ' eighteen years of age ', ' eighteen year old ', ' age 18 years ', ' 18 years of age ', ' 20 year old ', ' twenty years of age ', ' twenty year old ', ' age 20 years ', ' 20 years of age ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' Electronic cigarette ', ' ecigarette ', ' ecig ', ' e-cigarette ', ' e-cig ', ' health data ', ' Smoke-free home ', ' rate of change ', ' Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems ', ' electronic nicotine delivery device ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health ', ' nicotine use ', ' nicotine consumption ', ' tobacco user ', ' nicotine user ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' tobacco products ', ' ']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2019,432923,CA-52,0.01742979610307594
"Novel Methods for Evaluation and Implementation of Behavioral Intervention Technologies for Depression ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Major depressive disorder (MDD) is projected to be a leading cause of burden of disease globally and in the United States. In the United States, in 2012 alone, an estimated 16 million adults aged 18 or older (7% of all adults) had at least one major depressive episode. While psychological treatments are effective at treating depression, the high prevalence of MDD makes it impossible to meet the needs in the population with standard one-to-one intensive psychological treatments. Behavioral intervention technologies (BITs) use technologies such as mobile phones to support behavior change to improve mental health, and have been shown to have similar effects to psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy. With the growing number of mobile phone users, BIT is a viable and promising option for delivering psychotherapy. On the other hand, the current evaluation framework of new interventions is not adequate for evaluating and implementing BITs, because of the rapidly evolving BIT landscape and the complexity of the interventions. This research aims to develop and validate novel concepts and evaluation framework to address these two challenges in the dissemination and implementation of BITs in MDD patients in pragmatic settings. We plan to achieve this research goal in four steps. First, we will develop a new statistical design, called open-ended adaptive randomization (OAR) procedure, which will enable us to continuously evaluate BITs that enter and leave a care delivery system. The OAR also aims to improve quality of care given to the participating patients, by sequentially allocating patients away from inferior BITs based on the interim evidence during deployment. Second, we will develop a data analytical technique, called regularized Q-learning, which will enable us to perform variable selection in high-dimensional settings and retain only the important predictors of health outcomes in the learning model. While the original Q-learning is a cutting-edge technique originating from the computer science literature, the research will extend its capability to handle high-dimensional data and enrich the learning model by incorporating regularized regression. Third, we will prepare for the next implementation phase of the proposed methods, by calibrating the methods with computer simulations, creating an initial knowledge base by analyzing data from current randomized clinical trials, identifying partnerships with healthcare providers and app curation plaftorms. Fourth, we will advocate for the general implementation of the proposed methods by producing publications, building cognitive computing systems, and tracking the source of citation and adoption of the published results by the broader health research community. Our long-term goal is to enhance our capability of deploying complex interventions such as BITs to depressed patients in a personalized and evidence-based manner throughout the healthcare system. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is common, and imposes a high societal cost in terms of quality of life, work productivity, functional status, morbidity and mortality. The national healthcare system will not be able to meet the needs in the population with standard one-to-one intensive psychological treatments. With the growing number of smartphone use, behavioral intervention technologies have become a viable and scalable option to deliver psychotherapy to the population.

"Smartband/smartphone-based automatic smoking detection and real time mindfulness intervention PROJECT SUMMARY Smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in the US. Effective smoking cessation interventions are available but underutilized. Smoking cessation interventions delivered by smartphone apps are a promising tool for helping smokers quit. Delivery of treatments via smartphone apps may maximize the likelihood of use by smokers and the potential impact on smoking behavior. However, currently available smartphone apps for smoking cessation have not exploited their unique potential advantages to aid quitting. Notably, no available apps utilize wearable technologies; all current apps require users to self-report their smoking; and no apps deliver treatment automatically contingent upon smoking. Therefore, this pilot trial will test the feasibility of using a smartband to detect and track smoking and deliver brief smoking cessation interventions by smartphone app in real time. The interventions to be delivered will be brief mindfulness exercises that have been previously shown to reduce craving and smoking. This trial uses SmokeBeat, a novel mobile technology platform that uses multimodal data from wristband sensors to monitor and detect smoking, notify smokers about their smoking in real time and deliver real time interventions triggered by detected smoking episodes. SmokeBeat also applies machine learning to smoking tracking data to identify individual smoking patterns and deliver real time interventions targeted at predicted smoking episodes. This trial tests a three-step intervention to reduce smoking, in which smokers first become aware of their smoking and triggers by tracking smoking; then gain a clear recognition of the actual effects of smoking by “mindful smoking”; and finally learn to work mindfully with cravings rather than smoke. Briefly, daily smokers (N=200, ≥5 cig/day) will wear a smartband to detect and notify them of smoking for 21 days and obtain individual smoking profiles; detected smoking will then trigger a “mindful smoking” exercise for the next 7 days leading up to their quit date at 30 days; after which another mindfulness exercise (“RAIN”: recognize, accept, investigate and note cravings rather than smoke) will be delivered prior to each predicted smoking episode according to their individual smoking profile for 30 days post-quit. Aim 1 will be to determine treatment fidelity. Fidelity measures will be: (1) percent of smoking episodes correctly detected; (2) percent of “mindful smoking” exercises correctly triggered by smoking; and (3) users’ real time ratings of how timely “RAIN” was delivered to predicted smoking episodes. Aim 2 will be to determine adherence to treatment. Adherence measures will be: (1) percent of time spent wearing the smartband; (2) percent of smoking notifications answered; (3) percent of ecological momentary assessment (EMA) ratings (e.g., timeliness and others) answered; and (4) percent of mindfulness exercises completed. Aim 3 will be to determine the acceptability of treatment. Acceptability measures will be: (1) average helpfulness ratings after each mindfulness exercise; (2) feedback on user experience surveys.

"SenseWhy: Overeating in Obesity Through the Lens of Passive Sensing PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Medical professionals have recently put to rest the idea that there is an ideal weight loss diet for everyone. One cause for obesity is overeating, but we do not know what patterns and behaviors contribute to this problematic habit. Defining problematic eating behaviors that lead to energy imbalance is essential for treating obesity. Studies typically focus on a single putative causal mechanism of overeating such as stress or craving, not addressing the multiple features that co-occur with overeating. Hence, the factors that predict overeating episodes remain unknown, as do which of them contribute to an individual's consistency and variability of overeating. Given recent advancements in passive sensing, we now have the potential to detect problematic eating using seamlessly captured physiological features such as number of feeding gestures and swallows, and heart rate variability. Collecting detectable and predictable features that identify overeating will hone in on the patterns that interventionists may optimally target to help populations with obesity understand their eating habits and ultimately improve their ability to self-regulate their eating behaviors. Location-scale models will map the factors that most contribute to habit formation within subjects, providing interventionists with essential targets to guide behavior. The first aim is to collect sensor-based and ecological momentary assessment data (to assess factors not yet detectable through sensing) from adults with obesity and apply machine learning algorithms to identify a subset of features that detect overeating, as validated against ground truth of videotaped eating episodes and 24 hour dietary recall. Participants will wear a passive sensing sensor suite and respond to random and event-triggered prompts regarding each eating episode. Then, machine learning will determine the optimal feature subset that detect overeating episodes using Gradient Boosting Machines. In the second aim, hierarchical clustering techniques will cluster overeating episodes into theoretically meaningful and clinically known problematic behaviors related to overeating. The final aim is to build statistical models that explain the effect of detectable and clinically-known problematic features on new habit formation. These models will lay a foundation for optimization studies to discover evidence-based decision rules that can guide timely interventions to treat obesity by preventing overeating, and maintaining healthy eating behaviors. PROJECT NARRATIVE Obesity affects more than a third of American adults. Weight loss regimens rely on self-monitoring, but many people struggle to exercise this skill due to difficulty of execution and small perceived short-term benefit. Wearable passive sensors allow us to learn an individual's problematic eating behaviors more easily. Analyzing sensor data then enables us to identify the essential factors that describe and even predict overeating, and ultimately provide personalized care that supports maintenance of healthy eating behaviors.",SenseWhy: Overeating in Obesity Through the Lens of Passive Sensing,9613247,K25DK113242,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' EtOH use ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Algorithms ', ' Appetitive Behavior ', ' Searching Behavior ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavioral Medicine ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Energy Intake ', ' caloric dietary content ', ' Caloric Intake ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Computers ', ' Cues ', ' Swallowing ', ' Deglutition ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating ', ' Exercise ', ' Family ', ' nutrient intake activity ', ' feeding-related behaviors ', ' Ingestive Behavior ', ' Feeding behaviors ', ' Foundations ', ' Gestures ', ' Goals ', ' Habits ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Heart Rate ', ' polyphagia ', ' Overeating ', ' Hyperphagia ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Maintenance ', ' Maps ', ' chews ', ' chewed ', ' Chewing ', ' Mastication ', ' Methods ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Moods ', ' Neck ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Phenotype ', ' Public Health ', ' Records ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Rest ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Running ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Smoking ', ' Stress ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Videotape ', ' wt-loss ', ' body weight loss ', ' Weight Reduction ', ' Weight Loss ', ' Body Weight decreased ', ' Wrist ', ' Friends ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' eating habit ', ' Dietary Habits ', ' Diet Habits ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Medical ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' participant recruitment ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Dietitian ', ' Scientist ', ' Hour ', ' Calories ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' computer science ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' social ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' craving ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Intake ', ' Monitor ', ' substance abuse treatment ', ' substance abuse therapy ', ' obesity treatment ', ' feeding ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' Food Access ', ' Population ', ' Eating Behavior ', ' hedonic ', ' lens ', ' lenses ', ' evidence base ', ' heart rate variability ', ' emotional eating ', ' emotional eater ', ' Regimen ', ' algorithmic methodologies ', ' algorithmic methods ', ' personalized care ', ' personalized patient care ', ' individualized patient care ', ' individualized care ', ' Precision care ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' Data Analytics ', ' wearable technology ', ' Healthy Eating ', ' wearable device ', ' wearable sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' body sensor ', ' adult obesity ', ' adults with obesity ', ' adult adiposity ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' adaptive intervention ', ' ']",NIDDK,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,K25,2019,165108,IL-07,-0.005777648266726285
"Development of an Integrated System for Monitoring Home-Cage Behavior in Non-Human Primates 7: Project Summary/Abstract Marmosets are emerging as an important model species for neuroscience research, driven by the development of new technologies such as CRISPR that allow targeted genetic modifications in this species. These developments will allow primate research to take advantage of powerful genetic tools that were previously restricted largely to rodents, including optogenetics, genetic activity reporters, and targeted mutation of endogenous genes implicated in brain function and human disease. Marmosets are well suited to this approach, being small and fast-breeding compared to most primates. They are typically housed in family groups, and exhibit a variety of social behaviors in captivity including complex vocal repertoires. Marmosets thus represent a promising system for studying social behavior and other cognitive functions in a primate model, and they also hold great promise for modeling brain disorders that affect cognitive functions that are difficult to study in other species such as rodents. To take full advantage of these emerging animal models, it is necessary to develop new methods for analyzing their behavior, including naturalistic social interactions that are imperfectly captured by standardized behavioral tasks. We therefore plan to develop a system for automated analysis of marmoset behaviors in the home cage. The system will consist of an integrated array of sensors including video cameras, depth sensors, and collar-mounted wearable microphones. The resulting multimodal data will be synchronized and analyzed using methods from computer vision, speech processing, machine learning, and multimodal data analysis. Specifically we will formulate the tracking analysis as a probabilistic graphical model, which will allow video data to be integrated with audio recordings, and with other modalities that could be explored in future, including inertial motion sensors, physiological recordings and other contextual data. Based on this approach we will develop methods to classify calls, identify individual callers, track the locations and identities of each animal in three dimensions, and classify different actions, including interactions between individuals. We envisage that our system will be useful for a wide range of studies in basic and translational neuroscience, and in particular it will be useful for studying behavioral phenotypes in genetic models of human psychiatric disorders, and for relating behavioral abnormalities to their underlying genetic and neural causes. 8: Project Narrative: We propose to develop an automated system for monitoring the behavior of marmosets in the home cage environment. The proposed system will measure a wide range of naturalistic behaviors including vocal and social interactions, and will be useful for studying animal models of psychiatric disorders such as autism and schizophrenia, in which these behaviors are disrupted. This in turn will allow researchers to relate behavioral abnormalities to their underlying neural and genetic causes, an essential step toward the understanding and eventual treatment of these disorders.",Development of an Integrated System for Monitoring Home-Cage Behavior in Non-Human Primates,9696008,R01MH111916,"['Acoustics ', ' Acoustic ', ' Affect ', ' Animals ', ' Behavior ', ' Animal Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Breeding ', ' Callithrix ', ' Short-Tusked Marmoset ', ' Marmosets ', ' Hapale ', ' computing system ', ' Computer Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Grooming ', ' Head ', ' Housing ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Language Development ', ' Methods ', ' Genetic Models ', ' Motion ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' Noise ', ' Parents ', ' Pathology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Posture ', ' Primates Mammals ', ' Primates ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodent ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Sleep ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' sociobehavior ', ' Social Behavior ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Standardization ', ' Time ', ' video recording system ', ' Videorecording ', ' Video Recording ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Training ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' nonhuman primate ', ' non-human primate ', ' Functional disorder ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Genetic ', ' Reporter ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' cognitive function ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Stream ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' 3D ', ' 3-D ', ' Location ', ' vibration ', ' vocalization ', ' gaze ', ' limb movement ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' offspring ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' Modality ', ' Modeling ', ' vocal learning ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' autistic spectrum disorder ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' Infantile Autism ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Autism ', ' Data ', ' Neurosciences Research ', ' Scheme ', ' Wireless Technology ', ' wireless ', ' Pathologic ', ' Monitor ', ' Modification ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' feeding ', ' Behavior monitoring ', ' behavioral monitoring ', ' social communication ', ' human disease ', ' speech processing ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' translational neuroscience ', ' optogenetics ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats ', ' CRISPR/Cas system ', ' CRISPR ', ' behavioral study ', ' behavior study ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' human model ', ' microphone ', ' multimodal data ', ' multi-modal data ', ' automated analysis ', ' social deficits ', ' social dysfunction ', ' social disorders ', ' social defects ', ' ']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2019,521954,MA-07,-0.004245150736480614

"Ethical Considerations for Language Modeling within Brain-Computer Interfaces Project Summary Machine learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) have the potential to transform communication for patients with neurodegenerative disease through personalized and real-time augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices. Individuals with severe communication impairments who can no longer control their daily conversations or participate in previous life roles want AAC devices. And they want them to work – to be reliable, effective, and fast. ML and NLP are emerging as promising tools to bridge current technology and next generation devices for individuals with the most severe speech and physical impairments, like the RSVP Keyboard™, a brain-computer interface (BCI) being developed by the parent grant. BCI systems for communication are referred to as AAC-BCIs. NLP efforts to combine large public data sets with private data sets, such as personal email messages, promise to give individuals with communication impairments their own personalized language models, models that are sufficiently robust to get closer to real-time communication. The focus on getting AAC-BCIs to work with machine learning, however, has led to a critical oversight in the field: an inadequate understanding of why individuals want next-generation devices and what trade-offs they are willing to make for faster and more personalized communication. The turn to ML brings this oversight into sharp relief. Individuals should provide input about the data sets used to construct their personal language models, but this raises important ethical questions about what individuals value, how they understand their identity, and what trade-offs they are willing to make relative to their personalized communication data. The goal of this supplement is to fill this gap in understanding so that researchers can implement ML into next generation AAC-BCI systems in a way that is sensitive to the ethical concerns of future users. There are four components to this ethics supplement: (1) to design a toolbox of ethics vignettes tailored to ethical concerns raised by both BCI communication and ML; (2) to administer monthly vignette-based online ethics surveys to individuals with severe communication impairments due to motor neuron disease (e.g., ALS) (n=25) or movement disorders (e.g., Parkinson's disease) (n=25); (3) to conduct semi-structured vignette-based interviews with individuals with pre- clinical or mild communication impairment due to motor neuron disease (n=10) or movement disorder (n=10). Components (2) and (3) will employ an iterative, parallel mixed-method approach. Trends in Likert-style online responses to ethics vignettes in the severe communication impairment cohort will be used to inform and modify the semi-structured interview prompts asked of the pre-clinical or mild impairment cohort. In parallel, themes emerging from direct content analysis of interviews will be used to refine online survey questions. Results of this iterative, mix-methods approach will be used (4) to outline a framework of core ethical domains and preliminary tools (vignettes and discussion prompts) that AAC-BCI researchers can use to assess ethical concerns while developing and iteratively refining communication technology for personalized language models. Project Narrative The populations of US citizens with severe speech and physical impairments secondary to neurodegenerative diseases are increasing as medical technologies advance and successfully support life. These individuals with limited to no movement could potentially contribute to their medical decision making, informed consent, and daily caregiving if they had faster, more reliable means that adapt to their best access methods in communication technologies.

"Whiteboard Coordinator: Intelligent Sensor Network and Machine Learning to Improve Operating Room Outcomes and Efficiency Hospital operating rooms (OR) are currently under tremendous pressure to maximize patient outcomes and safety while reducing costs. Hospitals that focus on disadvantaged socioeconomic populations are often further burdened to meet these growing demands with a significant lack of resources. The U.S. spent $2.6 trillion on healthcare in 2010 with 56% comprised of healthcare worker wages. Unlike virtually all other sectors, healthcare has experienced no gains in labor productivity over the last 20 years. A healthcare productivity crisis exists, as changing regulatory and insurance standards are complicating delivery of care and increasing documentation burden. Therefore, technology solutions, which use intelligent sensors to reduce manual burden and intelligent algorithms to navigate the complex healthcare operations and logistics, can solve significant unmet productivity challenges and allow clinical staff to focus on patient care, safety, and outcomes.  Operating rooms require a complex set of resources, planning, data entry and logistics. Accuracy, speed, and accessibility of information to support real-time changes to planned logistics and operational decision- making significantly impact patient outcomes and safety, clinician and patient satisfaction, and efficiency and cost savings. The operational target is to ensure the patient, surgeon, anesthesiologist, technicians, nurses, janitorial staff, equipment, instruments, supplies, rooms and beds are available at required times and locations. High stress clinical environments, which require dynamic information across stakeholders and resources to make timely and accurate decisions, can significantly benefit from automated sensor inputs and artificial intelligence to minimize manual burden. Therefore, the objective is to develop Whiteboard Coordinator (WC), a software command and control system for hospital operating rooms to reduce manual clinician burden, optimize efficiency, and allow a patient care focus. The technology will integrate sensors and machine learning to detect and track resources for planned surgical events, recognize deviations and delays, and update human, equipment, and facility resource allocation in real-time to maximize efficiency and information accessibility.  Significant innovation will differentiate WC from existing dashboard and electronic medical record (EMR) apps. First, an intelligent camera network and machine vision algorithms will automatically detect and update availability and location of OR resources. Secondly, software will automate existing manual documentation procedures that currently take up to 50% of clinician time. Third, while other systems are reactionary and focus on billing documentation, WC machine learning algorithms will facilitate care coordination and parallel workflow to maximize efficient and resource allocation. Finally, WC information will quickly be disseminated to all OR stakeholders (surgeons, nurses, technicians, janitorial staff, etc.) across multiple platforms and devices. Additionally, technology to optimize human and equipment resources can level the playing field for socioeconomic disparate locations to maximize limited resources on patient care and safety. !

"Human and Machine Learning for Customized Control of Assistive Robots PROJECT SUMMARY This application will result in a technological platform that re-empowers persons with severe paralysis, by allowing them to independently control a wide spectrum of robotic actions. Severe paralysis is devastating, and chronic—and reliance on caregivers is persistent. Assistive machines such as wheelchairs and robotic arms offer a groundbreaking path to independence: where control over their environment and interactions is returned to the person.  However, to operate complex machines like robotic arms and hands typically poses a difﬁcult learning challenge and requires complex control signals—and the commercial control interfaces accessible to persons with severe paralysis (e.g. sip-and-puff, switch-based head arrays) are not adequate. As a result, assistive robotic arms remain largely inaccessible to those with severe paralysis—arguably the population who would beneﬁt from them most.  The purpose of the proposed study is to provide people with tetraplegia with the means to control robotic arms with their available body mobility, while concurrently promoting the exercise of available body motions and the maintenance of physical health. Control interfaces that generate a unique map from a user's body motions to control signals for a machine offer a customized interaction, however these interfaces have only been used to issue low-dimensional (2-D) control signals whereas more complex machines require higher-dimensional (e.g. 6-D) signals. We propose an approach that leverages robotics autonomy and machine learning in order to aid the end-user in learning how to issue effective higher-dimensional control signals through body motions. Speciﬁcally, initially the human issues a lower- dimensional control signal and robotics autonomy is used to bridge the gap by taking over whatever is not covered by the human's control signal. Help from the robotics autonomy is then progressively scaled back, automatically, to cover fewer and fewer control dimensions as the user becomes more skilled.  The ﬁrst piece to our approach deals with how to extract control signals from the human, using the body-machine interface. The development and optimization of decoding procedures for controlling a robotic arm using residual body motions will be addressed under Speciﬁc Aim 1. The second piece to our approach deals with how to interpret control signals from a human within a paradigm that shares control between the human and robotics autonomy. To identify which shared-control formulations most effectively utilize the human's control signals will be the topic of Speciﬁc Aim 2. The ﬁnal piece to our approach deals with how to adapt the shared-control paradigm so that more control is transferred to the human over time. This adaptation is necessary for the human's learning process, since the goal in the end is for the human to be able to fully control the robotic arm him/herself, and will be assessed under Speciﬁc Aim 3.  At the completion of this project, tetraplegic end-users will be able to operate a robotic arm using their residual body motions, through an interface that both promotes the use of residual body motions (and thus also recovery of motor skill) and adapts with the human as their abilities change over time. By leveraging adaptive robotics autonomy, our application moreover provides a safe mechanism to facilitate learning how to operate the robotic platform. Frequently the more severe a person's motor impairment, the less able they are to operate the very assistive machines, like powered wheelchairs and robotic arms, which might enhance their quality of life. The purpose of the proposed study is to provide people with tetraplegia with the means, through non-invasive technologies, to control robotic arms with their available body mobility, while concurrently promoting the exercise of available body motions and the maintenance of physical health. We propose and study an approach that leverages robot machine learning and autonomy in order to facilitate human motor learning of how to operate a robotic arm using a customized interface, in order to make powered assisted manipulation more accessible to people with severe paralysis. 1",Human and Machine Learning for Customized Control of Assistive Robots,9773039,R01EB024058,"['Activities of Daily Living ', ' functional capacity ', ' functional ability ', ' daily living functionality ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Cerebral Palsy ', ' Computers ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating ', ' Environment ', ' Exercise ', ' Non-Trunk ', ' Limbs ', ' Extremities ', ' Limb structure ', ' Liberty ', ' Freedom ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Hand ', ' Head ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Learning ', ' Maintenance ', ' Maps ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Motion ', ' Motivation ', ' Motor Skills ', ' body movement ', ' Movement ', ' insular sclerosis ', ' Disseminated Sclerosis ', ' Multiple Sclerosis ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' Posture ', ' tetraplegic ', ' Tetraplegia ', ' Quadriplegic ', ' Quadriplegia ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' rehabilitative therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Remote Operation (Robotics) ', ' Robotics ', ' assistive device ', ' Assistive Technology ', ' Self-Help Devices ', ' Shoulder ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Stroke ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' mobile assistive system ', ' mobile assistive device ', ' mobile assistance system ', ' mobile assistance device ', ' Wheel Chairs ', ' Wheelchairs ', ' Work ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' Powered wheelchair ', ' Electric wheelchair ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Left ', ' Chronic ', ' Residual state ', ' Residual ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Fostering ', ' Robot ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Side ', ' System ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' 3D ', ' 3-D ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' Paralysed ', ' paralytic ', ' paralysis ', ' Plegia ', ' Palsy ', ' Performance ', ' empowerment ', ' Devices ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' feeding ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' brain machine interface ', ' Spinal cord injured survivor ', ' spinal cord injury survivor ', ' SCI survivor ', ' Population ', ' two-dimensional ', ' 2-dimensional ', ' motor learning ', ' locomotor learning ', ' n-dimensional ', ' motor impairment ', ' movement limitation ', ' movement impairment ', ' arm ', ' body-machine interface ', ' motor recovery ', ' Formulation ', ' robot control ', ' robotic control ', ' high dimensionality ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' assistive robot ', ' ']",NIBIB,REHABILITATION INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO D/B/A SHIRLEY RYAN ABILITYLAB,R01,2019,329494,IL-07,-0.010134339453430998
"Intelligent deployment of containerized bioinformatics workflows on the cloud PROJECT SUMMARY Cloud computing has emerged as a promising solution to address the challenges of big data. Public cloud vendors provide computing as-a-utility enabling users to pay only for the resources that are actually used. In this application, we will develop methods and tools to enable biomedical researchers to optimize the costs of cloud computing when analyzing biomedical big data. Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) cloud provides computing as a utility, on-demand, to end users, enabling cloud resources to be rapidly provisioned and scaled to meet computational and performance requirements. In addition, dynamic intelligent allocation of cloud computing resources has great potential to both improve performance and reduce hosting costs. Unfortunately, determining the most cost-effective and efficient ways to deploy modules on the cloud is non- trivial, due to a plethora of cloud vendors, each providing different types of virtual machines with different capabilities, performance trade-offs, and pricing structures. In addition, modern bioinformatics workflows consist of multiple modules, applications and libraries, each with their own set of software dependencies. Software containers package binary executables and scripts into modules with their software dependencies. With containers that compartmentalize software dependencies, modules implemented as containers can be mixed and matched to create workflows that give identical results on any platform. The high degree of reproducibility and flexibility of software containers makes them ideal instruments for disseminating complex bioinformatics workflows. Our overarching goal is to deliver the latest technological advances in containers and cloud computing to a typical biomedical researcher with limited resources who works with big data. Specifically, we will develop a user-friendly drag-and-drop interface to enable biomedical researchers to build and edit containerized workflows. Most importantly, users can choose to deploy and scale selected modules in the workflow on cloud computing platforms in a transparent, yet guided fashion, to optimize cost and performance. Our aim is to provide a federated approach that leverages resources from multiple cloud vendors. We have assembled a team of interdisciplinary scientists with expertise in bioinformatics, cloud and distributed computing, and machine learning. As part of this application, we will work closely with end users who routinely generate and analyze RNA-seq data. We will illustrate how our containerized, cloud-enabled methods and tools will benefit bioinformatics analyses. Project Narrative Cloud computing has emerged as a promising solution to address the challenge of analyzing diverse and massive data generated to advance our understanding of health and diseases. We will develop methods and tools to build and intelligently deploy modular and cloud-enabled bioinformatics workflows.

"Machine learning of physiological variables to predict diagnose and treat cardiorespiratory instability Project Summary/Abstract: If one could accurately predict who, when and why patients develop cardiorespiratory instability (CRI), then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve outcome and better use care resources. However, CRI is often unrecognized until it is well established and patients are more refractory to treatment, or progressed to organ injury. We have shown that an integrated monitoring system alert obtained from continuous noninvasively acquired monitoring parameters and coupled to a care algorithm improved step-down unit (SDU) patient outcomes. We also showed that advanced HR variability analysis (sample entropy) identified SDU patients at CRI risk within 2 minutes, and if monitored for 5 minutes differentiated between patients who would develop CRI or remain stable over the next 48 hours. We also applied machine learning (ML) modeling to our clinically-relevant porcine model of hemorrhagic shock to characterize responses to hypovolemia, hemorrhage, and resuscitation, predict which animals would or would not collapse during hypovolemia, and identify occult bleeding 5 minutes earlier than with traditional monitoring. We now propose to apply our work to vulnerable and invasively monitored ICU patients. We will develop multivariable models through ML data-driven classification techniques such as regression, Fourier and principal component analysis, artificial neural networks, random forest classification, etc. as well as more novel approaches (temporal rule learning developed by our team; Bayesian Aggregation) to predict CRI in ICU patients. We will first use our existing annotated high fidelity waveform MIMIC II clinical data set (4200 patients) to develop predictive models and differential signatures for various CRI drivers. We will also use our high-density data collection and processing platform (Bernoulli) to prospectively collect data from ICUs in three institutions: Univ. Pittsburgh (PITT), Univ. California (UC) Irvine and UC San Diego (initial algorithm development conducted at PITT and validated in the UC systems). We will identify the number and type of independent measures, sampling frequency, and lead time necessary to create robust algorithms to: 1) predict impending CRI, 2) select the most effective treatments, 3) monitor treatment response, and 4) determine when treatment has restored physiologic stability and can be stopped. We will also determine the smallest number and types of parameters coupled to the longest CRI lead time to achieve the above four targets with the best sensitivity and specificity (a concept we call Monitoring Parsimony).We will simultaneously iteratively design and test a graphical user interface (GUI) and clinical decision support system (CDSS) driven by these parsimoniously derived predictive smart alerts and functional hemodynamic monitoring treatment approaches in two human simulation environments (PITT & UC Irvine).We envision a basic monitoring surveillance that identifies patients most likely to develop CRI to apply focused clinician attention and targeted treatments to deliver highly personalized medical care. Public Health Narrative If one could accurately predict who, when and why patients develop shock then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve outcome and more effectively use healthcare resources. But signs of shock often occur late once organ injury is already present. The purpose of this study is to first develop multivariable models through data-driven classification techniques to parsimoniously predict cardiovascular insufficiency, etiology and response to treatment. We will do this first in our existing MIMIC II clinical data sets of 4200 ICU patients as to timing and types of instability. Then we will prospectively collect real time high- density data on patients admitted to our trauma intensive care units of University of Pittsburgh, UC Irvine and UC San Diego. We will create and test in simulators of ICU care bedside user interfaces to drive recognition and treatment algorithms based on these models in all three medical centers.",Machine learning of physiological variables to predict diagnose and treat cardiorespiratory instability,9685235,R01GM117622,"['Algorithms ', ' Animals ', ' Attention ', ' California ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Critically Ill ', ' Critical Illness ', ' Data Collection ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' hemodynamics ', ' blood loss ', ' Bleeding ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Physiological Homeostasis ', ' Autoregulation ', ' Homeostasis ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Intensive Care Units ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Libraries ', ' Physiological Monitoring ', ' Physiologic Monitoring ', ' mortality ', ' Pathological Processes ', ' Pathologic Processes ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Resuscitation ', ' Risk ', ' Running ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' circulatory shock ', ' Circulatory Collapse ', ' Shock ', ' Hemorrhagic Shock ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Specificity ', ' Stress ', ' suid ', ' porcine ', ' Swine ', ' Suidae ', ' Pigs ', ' Family suidae ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Triage ', ' Universities ', ' Weaning ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Normal Values ', ' Normal Range ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' density ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Mechanical ventilation ', ' mechanical respiratory assist ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Refractory ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Medical ', ' insight ', ' Exposure to ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Entropy ', ' Principal Component Analysis ', ' Principal Component Analyses ', ' Hour ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Stream ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Clinical Decision Support Systems ', ' Hypovolemia ', ' Medical center ', ' diagnostic accuracy ', ' Accuracy of Diagnosis ', ' simulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Organ failure ', ' data processing ', ' computerized data processing ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' fitness ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' trial treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Perioperative ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' early onset ', ' cost ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' Sepsis ', ' bloodstream infection ', ' blood infection ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' prospective ', ' Trauma ', ' Coupled ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' graphical user interface ', ' graphic user interface ', ' Graphical interface ', ' iterative design ', ' prototype ', ' high risk ', ' clinical care ', ' patient population ', ' treatment response ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' database structure ', ' data base structure ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' support tools ', ' improved outcome ', ' predictive tools ', ' clinical decision support ', ' individual response ', ' individualized response ', ' cardiovascular insufficiency ', ' artificial neural network ', ' synthetic neural network ', ' computational neural network ', ' artificial neural net ', ' random forest ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,586227,PA-18,-0.035718232072422765
"Top-down control of auditory processing in the cortico-collicular network Project Summary Throughout life, humans and other animals learn statistical regularities in the acoustic environment and adapt their hearing to emphasize the elements of sound that are important for behavioral decisions. Using these abilities, normal-hearing humans are able to perceive important sounds in crowded noisy environments and understand the speech of individuals the first time they meet. However, patients with peripheral hearing loss or central processing disorders often have problems hearing in these challenging settings, even when sound is amplified above perceptual threshold. This study seeks to characterize how two major areas in the brain's auditory network, auditory cortex and midbrain inferior colliculus, establish an interface between incoming auditory signals and the internal brain states that select information appropriate to the current behavioral context. Single-unit neural activity will be recorded from both of these brain areas in awake ferrets during the presentation of complex naturalistic sounds that mimic the acoustic environment encountered in the real world. Internal brain state will be controlled by selective attention to specific sound features in these complex stimuli. Changes in stimulus-evoked neural activity as attention shifts among sound features will be measured to identify interactions between internal state and incoming sensory signals in these different areas. Previous work has identified a large corticofugal projection from auditory cortex to inferior colliculus that could produce task-dependent changes in selectivity in inferior colliculus. This study will test the role of these corticofugal projections by optogenetic inactivation of auditory cortex during recordings from inferior colliculus. Selective inactivation of specific pathways will characterize how the network of brain areas works together to produce effective auditory behaviors. Computational modeling tools will be used to determine, from an algorithmic perspective, how neurons encode information about the natural stimuli and how this encoding changes as attention is shifted between features. Data collected during behavior will be used to develop models that combine bottom-up sensory processing and top-down behavioral control. This computational approach builds on classic characterizations of neural stimulus-response relationships using spectro-temporal receptive field models. New models will be developed that incorporate behavioral state variables and nonlinear biological circuit elements into established model frameworks. Together, these studies will provide new insight into the computational strategies used by the behaving brain to process complex sounds in real-world contexts. Project Narrative Patients with hearing impairments and central neurological disorders have difficulty processing and making accurate judgments about auditory stimuli, particular in challenging noisy environments. We seek to understand how the healthy brain learns to extract useful information from sounds in order to guide effective behavior. These experiments will provide novel insight into how the brain solves problems that can be used to develop new devices and treatments for these debilitating conditions.",Top-down control of auditory processing in the cortico-collicular network,9634046,R01DC014950,"['Acoustics ', ' Acoustic ', ' Algorithms ', ' Animals ', ' Attention ', ' Auditory area ', ' Auditory Cortex ', ' Auditory Perceptual Disorders ', ' central processing disorder ', ' Psychoacoustical Disorders ', ' Auditory Processing Disorder ', ' Auditory Perceptual Diseases ', ' Auditory Comprehension Disorder ', ' Acoustic Perceptual Disorder ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Crowding ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Feedback ', ' Ferrets ', ' Hearing ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Posterior Quadrigeminal Body ', ' Inferior Colliculus ', ' Judgment ', ' Learning ', ' Mammalia ', ' Mammals ', ' Midbrain ', ' Mid-brain ', ' Mesencephalon ', ' Midbrain structure ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' neurophysiological ', ' neurophysiology ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Research ', ' Rewards ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' sound ', ' Speech ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' auditory stimulus ', ' base ', ' Peripheral ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' Non-linear Models ', ' Nonlinear Models ', ' Link ', ' selective attention ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' awake ', ' receptive field ', ' Individual ', ' Hearing problem ', ' hearing disease ', ' Hearing Disorders ', ' Functional disorder ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Behavior Control ', ' behavioral control ', ' Behavioral Manipulation ', ' Life ', ' Auditory ', ' Complex ', ' Stream ', ' Sensory ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Response to stimulus physiology ', ' stimulus/response ', ' Auditory system ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Structure ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Central Auditory Processing Disorder ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' behavior influence ', ' behavioral influence ', ' hearing impairment ', ' hearing dysfunction ', ' hearing disability ', ' hearing difficulty ', ' hearing deficit ', ' hearing defect ', ' dysfunctional hearing ', ' Hypoacusis ', ' Hypoacuses ', ' Hearing Loss ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Synaptic plasticity ', ' Impairment ', ' optogenetics ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' auditory processing ', ' Auditory Prosthesis ', ' hearing prosthetic ', ' hearing prosthesis ', ' auditory prosthetic ', ' normal hearing ', ' healthy hearing ', ' good hearing ', ' ']",NIDCD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,327250,OR-03,-0.01812324337920666
"Prospective Health Outcomes and Inflammatory Biomarkers Associated with e-Cigarette Use Project Summary. This project is designed to identify validated biomarkers for use in the assessment of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) by the FDA. Since the introduction of ENDS, commonly referred to as e-cigarettes, there has been a large increase in ENDS use among young adults and older traditional cigarette smokers who also use ENDS (dual users). Since 2016, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has had regulatory authority over ENDS, and there is an acute need for ENDS-related biomarkers that can be used as validated surrogate endpoints for evaluation of new ENDS products. With the goal of validated biomarker discovery in two independent cohorts, the COPDGene and UCSD ENDS studies, we propose to identify ENDS-related inflammatory biomarkers in ENDS only and dual users and relate these biomarkers to five-year lung health outcomes. COPDGene is an ongoing, longitudinal study of >6,000 current and former traditional cigarette (t-cig) smokers enriched for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with detailed longitudinal lung phenotyping data (including chest CT), genome-wide blood RNA-seq, and proteomic data. The UCSD ENDS Study is a controlled study of young ENDS only users and controls with detailed assessment of inflammatory biomarkers in the oropharynx, airways and blood.  Biomarkers used as validated surrogate measures must be 1) associated with ENDS use, 2) predictive of health outcomes, and 3) have a strong biological rationale. We hypothesize that inflammatory biomarkers of ENDS use will be predictive of five-year lung health effects. In Aim 1 of this proposal, discovery of inflammatory transcriptomic and proteomic biomarkers of ENDS exposure will be performed in subjects from the COPDGene five-year study visit, and biomarkers will be validated in two independent sets of subjects from the COPDGene ten-year visit and the UCSD ENDS Study. In Aim 2 we will identify antibody-specific adaptive immune response biomarkers of ENDS exposure using adaptive immune receptor repertoire sequencing (AIRR-seq). Auto-antibodies are biomarkers that are associated with the degree of lung damage in COPD. AIRR-seq is a powerful tool for inflammatory biomarker discovery that characterizes an individual’s decades-long history of antibody responses. In Aim 3 we will use machine learning predictive models to relate ENDS-associated biomarker panels to five-year lung health outcomes from COPDGene. The investigative team for this grant is well-positioned to identify novel inflammatory biomarkers of ENDS use. The COPDGene and UCSD cohorts have the detailed lung phenotyping and molecular characterization necessary to discover and clinically validate biomarkers in two important populations of ENDS users, i.e. ENDS only and dual users. Public Health Relevance: Since the introduction of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), commonly referred to as e-cigarettes, there has been a large increase in ENDS use among young adults and older traditional cigarette smokers who also use ENDS (dual users).

"Tools for modeling state-dependent sensory encoding by neural populations across spatial and temporal scales Project Summary Throughout life, humans and other animals learn statistical regularities in the natural acoustic environment. They adapt their hearing to emphasize the features of sound that are important for making behavioral decisions. Normal-hearing humans are able to perceive important sounds in crowded noisy scenes and to understand the speech of individuals the first time they meet. However, patients with peripheral hearing loss or central processing disorders often have problems hearing in these challenging settings, even when sound is amplified above perceptual threshold. A better understanding of the function of the healthy and impaired auditory system will support new treatments for these deficits. This project will develop computational tools to study central auditory processing. A software library will support fitting and evaluating a large number of encoding models to describe the functional relationship between a time-varying natural auditory stimulus and the corresponding neural response. Many such models have been proposed, but relatively few direct comparisons have been made between them. This project will enable their comparison, allowing identification of the key features that contribute positively to their performance. The system will have a modular design so that useful elements from different models can be combined into comprehensive models with even greater explanatory power. The software will be open source and will support data from multiple recording modalities, including small-scale single unit electrophysiological and calcium imaging data, as well as large-scale local field and magnetoencephalography data. In addition to building on existing hypotheses about neural coding, the system will support machine learning methods for fitting artificial neural network models using the same datasets. These large, data-driven models have proven valuable for wide ranging signal processing problems, but their value and relation to existing models for neural sensory processing remain to be explored. Sensory processing involves coherent activity of large neural populations. To study coding at the population level, the system will support models that characterize the simultaneous activity of multiple neural signals and identifies latent subspaces of population activity related to sound encoding. Sensory coding is also influenced by behavioral context, reflecting changes in behavioral demands and the more general environment. The system will incorporate behavioral state variables into models, where encoding properties can be modulated by changes in behavioral context. Project Narrative Patients with hearing impairments and central neurological disorders have difficulty processing and making accurate judgments about auditory stimuli, particularly in challenging noisy environments. We seek to understand how the neural populations in the healthy brain represent complex natural sounds. These experiments will provide novel insight into how the brain solves problems that can be used to develop new devices and treatments for these debilitating conditions.",Tools for modeling state-dependent sensory encoding by neural populations across spatial and temporal scales,9774688,R01EB028155,"['Acoustics ', ' Acoustic ', ' Algorithms ', ' Animals ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Arousal ', ' Attention ', ' Auditory Perceptual Disorders ', ' central processing disorder ', ' Psychoacoustical Disorders ', ' Auditory Processing Disorder ', ' Auditory Perceptual Diseases ', ' Auditory Comprehension Disorder ', ' Acoustic Perceptual Disorder ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Calcium ', ' Communities ', ' Crowding ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Hearing ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Judgment ', ' Libraries ', ' magnetoencephalographic imaging ', ' MEG imaging ', ' Magnetoencephalography ', ' Methods ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Biological Models ', ' Motion ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' neurophysiological ', ' neurophysiology ', ' Patients ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Publishing ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' sound ', ' Speech ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Imagery ', ' Visualization ', ' auditory stimulus ', ' base ', ' Peripheral ', ' Area ', ' Non-linear Models ', ' Nonlinear Models ', ' Pythons ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' receptive field ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Hearing problem ', ' hearing disease ', ' Hearing Disorders ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Dimensions ', ' Auditory ', ' Complex ', ' Sensory ', ' System ', ' Visual system structure ', ' Visual System ', ' Auditory system ', ' Performance ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Calcium Signaling ', ' Calcium Ion Signaling ', ' neurotransmission ', ' neuronal signaling ', ' neural signaling ', ' nerve signaling ', ' glial signaling ', ' glia signaling ', ' axonal signaling ', ' axon-glial signaling ', ' axon signaling ', ' Neuronal Transmission ', ' Nerve Transmission ', ' Nerve Impulse Transmission ', ' novel ', ' sensory system ', ' sensory stimulus ', ' physicochemical phenomena related to the senses ', ' perceptual stimulus ', ' Modality ', ' Devices ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Modeling ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' behavior influence ', ' behavioral influence ', ' Sensory Process ', ' hearing impairment ', ' hearing dysfunction ', ' hearing disability ', ' hearing difficulty ', ' hearing deficit ', ' hearing defect ', ' dysfunctional hearing ', ' Hypoacusis ', ' Hypoacuses ', ' Hearing Loss ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Metadata ', ' meta data ', ' reconstruction ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' Impairment ', ' neural model ', ' open source ', ' graphical user interface ', ' graphic user interface ', ' Graphical interface ', ' data format ', ' signal processing ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' online repository ', ' web-based repository ', ' web repository ', ' online archive ', ' on-line repository ', ' on-line archive ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' auditory processing ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' artificial neural network ', ' synthetic neural network ', ' computational neural network ', ' artificial neural net ', ' normal hearing ', ' healthy hearing ', ' good hearing ', ' ']",NIBIB,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,1082375,OR-03,-0.0344037309776407
"Brain Science Compute Cluster Computational requirements of contemporary brain science research typically exceed financial and resource management limits of individual investigator laboratories. Many brain science research projects require analysis of large data sets with advanced statistical methods and anatomical reconstruction techniques. These methods require high speed computational and graphics engines operating in a multiple processor environments equipped with large capacity, high speed storage devices. An ongoing limitation in the Brown brain science effort at understanding neural processing is the lack of a contemporary and readily accessible high-speed computational resource.  We plan to replace an existing, but 5 year old and now outmoded, central computational resource that has outdated graphic processing units (GPU) and central processing units (CPU) and and limited storage that will serve the computational needs of a core group of brain science investigators at Brown without compromising individual access to stand-alone workstations. The requested computation equipment comprises 13 GPU nodes (total of 52 cores), 12 CPU nodes (288 cores) and 1.2 petabytes of disk storage, which will serve the needs of the assembled brain science researchers. The equipment will become integrated into Brown's high performance Compute Cluster, which has system software that automatically balances GPU and CPU usage, thereby ensuring maximum access to the computational resource for all users. Intensive 3D graphics are off- loaded either to GPUs or to client workstations, thereby further reducing the central computational load. Commercial or open-source software with an open operating environment will be used for analysis using standard and novel statistical and machine learning approaches to assess significance of large data sets.  This proposal details the architecture and benefits of a contemporary computational resource for the major and minor users, and more generally the Brown brain science community. The resource was designed to fill immediate and near-term computational and storage needs of a core group of Brown brain scientists. The system can be readily expansion as needs, either computational, storage, or new users, arise. Expansion of the existing core investigators group can occur easily since the computational power or storage capacity of the system can be readily enhanced at relatively low cost.  The flexible nature of the system will serve a variety of research needs of the Brown brain science community. The computational resource is expected to bring together researchers at Brown working on the common problem of neural processing.

"Semantic Data Lake for Biomedical Research Capitalizing on the transformative opportunities afforded by the extremely large and ever-growing volume, velocity, and variety of biomedical data being continuously produced is a major challenge. The development and increasingly widespread adoption of several new technologies, including next generation genetic sequencing, electronic health records and clinical trials systems, and research data warehouses means that we are in the midst of a veritable explosion in data production. This in turn results in the migration of the bottleneck in scientific productivity into data management and interpretation: tools are urgently needed to assist cancer researchers in the assembly, integration, transformation, and analysis of these Big Data sets. In this project, we propose to develop the Semantic Data Lake for Biomedical Research (SDL-BR) system, a cluster-computing software environment that enables rapid data ingestion, multifaceted data modeling, logical and semantic querying and data transformation, and intelligent resource discovery. SDL-BR is based on the idea of a data lake, a distributed store that does not make any assumptions about the structure of incoming data, and that delays modeling decisions until data is to be used. This project adds to the data lake paradigm methods for semantic data modeling, integration, and querying, and for resource discovery based on learned relationships between users and data resources. The SDL-BR System is a distributed computing software solution that enables research institutions to manage, integrate, and make available large institutional data sets to researchers, and that permits users to generate data models specific to particular applications. It uses state of the art cluster computing, Semantic Web, and machine learning technologies to provide for rapid data ingestion, semantic modeling and querying, and search and discovery of data resources through a sophisticated, Web-based user interface.",Semantic Data Lake for Biomedical Research,9765194,R44CA206782,"['Adoption ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma ', ' nonsmall cell lung cancer ', ' Nonsmall Cell Lung Carcinoma ', ' Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ', ' NSCLC - Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ', ' NSCLC ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Collection ', ' Data Sources ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Environment ', ' Explosion ', ' genetic biomarker ', ' Genetic Markers ', ' indexing ', ' Intelligence ', ' Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia ', ' Chronic Myelocytic Leukemia ', ' Chronic Granulocytic Leukemia ', ' Chronic Myeloid Leukemia ', ' Malignant Melanoma ', ' melanoma ', ' Methods ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' Patents ', ' Legal patent ', ' Production ', ' Productivity ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Semantics ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Vocabulary Words ', ' Vocabulary ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Phase ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Ingestion ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Data Quality ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Liquid substance ', ' liquid ', ' fluid ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Catalogs ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Services ', ' data management ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Informatics ', ' technology development ', ' tech development ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Modeling ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Institution ', ' Legal ', ' Address ', ' Biomedical Computing ', ' biomedical computation ', ' Data ', ' Retrieval ', ' Collection ', ' Ontology ', ' Security ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' systems research ', ' time use ', ' computer based Semantic Analysis ', ' semantic web ', ' data modeling ', ' modeling of the data ', ' model the data ', ' model of data ', ' Knowledge Extraction ', ' data integration ', ' cluster computing ', ' distributed computing ', ' datagrid ', ' data grid ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' cost effective ', ' migration ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' mobile device ', ' prototype ', ' data exchange ', ' data transmission ', ' natural language ', ' clinical data warehouse ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Secure ', ' High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing ', ' High-Throughput Sequencing ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' individualized medicine ', ' unique treatment ', ' tailored treatment ', ' tailored therapy ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' individualized treatment ', ' individualized therapy ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' customized treatment ', ' customized therapy ', ' Precision therapeutics ', ' precision treatment ', ' precision therapies ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted therapy ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' genetic information ', ' Data Science ', ' Data Discovery ', ' Data Analytics ', ' disease heterogeneity ', ' data access ', ' data resource ', ' data warehouse ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Banks ', ' off-patent ', ' ']",NCI,"INFOTECH SOFT, INC.",R44,2019,238768,FL-27,0.0002151833908344095
"Dense life-log health analytics from wearable senors using functional analysis and Riemannian geometry The growth and acceptance of wearable devices (e.g., accelerometers) and personal technologies (e.g., smartphones), coupled with larger storage capacities, waterproofing, and more unobtrusive wear locations, has made long-term monitoring of behaviors throughout the 24-hour spectrum more feasible. Wearable devices relevant for human activity (e.g., GENEActiv accelerometer) contain several complementary sensors (accelerometers, gyro, heart- rate monitor etc.) and sample at high rates (e.g., 100Hz for accelerometer). These high-sampling rates and the long duration of capture result in life-log data that truly qualifies as multimodal and big time-series data. The challenges and opportunities involved in fully harvesting these types of data, for widely applicable interventions, suggest that an interdisciplinary approach spanning mathematical sciences, signal processing, and health is needed. Our innovation includes the use of functional-data analysis tools to represent and process the dense time-series data. Functional data analysis is then integrated into machine learning and pattern discovery algorithms for activity classification, prediction of attributes, and discovery of new activity classes. We anticipate that the proposed framework will lead to new insights about human activity and its impact on health outcomes. This interdisciplinary project builds on several research activities of the team. Our past work includes: a) new mathematical developments for computing statistics on time-series data viewed as elements of a function-spaces, b) algorithms for activity recognition that integrate the function-space techniques, and c) data from long-term observational studies of human activity from multimodal sensors. The new work we propose addresses the unique mathematical and computational challenges posed by densely multimodal, long-term, densely-sampled Iifelog big-data in a comprehensive framework. The fusion of ideas from human activity modeling, functional-analysis, geometric metrics, and algorithmic machine learning, present unique opportunities for fundamental advancement of the state-of-the-art in objective measurement and quantification of behavioral markers from wearable devices. The proposed approach also brings to fore: a) new mathematical developments of elastic metrics over multi-modal time-series data, b) comparing sequences evolving on different feature manifolds, c) estimation of quasi- periodicities, d) and a new generation of machine-learning and pattern discovery algorithms. The mathematical and algorithmic tools proposed have the potential to significantly advance how wearable data from contemporary devices with high-sampling rates and large storage capabilities are represented, processed, and transformed into accurate inferences about human activity. Wearable devices are becoming more widely adopted in recent years for general health and recreational uses by the broad populace. This research will result in improved algorithms to process the data available from such wearable devices.

"Intelligent deployment of containerized bioinformatics workflows on the cloud PROJECT SUMMARY Cloud computing has emerged as a promising solution to address the challenges of big data. Public cloud vendors provide computing as-a-utility enabling users to pay only for the resources that are actually used. In this application, we will develop methods and tools to enable biomedical researchers to optimize the costs of cloud computing when analyzing biomedical big data. Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) cloud provides computing as a utility, on-demand, to end users, enabling cloud resources to be rapidly provisioned and scaled to meet computational and performance requirements. In addition, dynamic intelligent allocation of cloud computing resources has great potential to both improve performance and reduce hosting costs. Unfortunately, determining the most cost-effective and efficient ways to deploy modules on the cloud is non- trivial, due to a plethora of cloud vendors, each providing different types of virtual machines with different capabilities, performance trade-offs, and pricing structures. In addition, modern bioinformatics workflows consist of multiple modules, applications and libraries, each with their own set of software dependencies. Software containers package binary executables and scripts into modules with their software dependencies. With containers that compartmentalize software dependencies, modules implemented as containers can be mixed and matched to create workflows that give identical results on any platform. The high degree of reproducibility and flexibility of software containers makes them ideal instruments for disseminating complex bioinformatics workflows. Our overarching goal is to deliver the latest technological advances in containers and cloud computing to a typical biomedical researcher with limited resources who works with big data. Specifically, we will develop a user-friendly drag-and-drop interface to enable biomedical researchers to build and edit containerized workflows. Most importantly, users can choose to deploy and scale selected modules in the workflow on cloud computing platforms in a transparent, yet guided fashion, to optimize cost and performance. Our aim is to provide a federated approach that leverages resources from multiple cloud vendors. We have assembled a team of interdisciplinary scientists with expertise in bioinformatics, cloud and distributed computing, and machine learning. As part of this application, we will work closely with end users who routinely generate and analyze RNA-seq data. We will illustrate how our containerized, cloud-enabled methods and tools will benefit bioinformatics analyses. Project Narrative Cloud computing has emerged as a promising solution to address the challenge of analyzing diverse and massive data generated to advance our understanding of health and diseases.

"The role of ENDS use in changing rates of escalation and quitting of cigarette smoking in those under age 35 years in US population Abstract Recently, there has been extensive use of Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS) by young people in the United States (US). These products have the potential to significantly reduce the proportion of young adults who are addicted to cigarette smoking, either by influencing the proportion who escalate to daily cigarette smoking or by increasing the proportion who quit under the age of 35 years. Previous research has demonstrated that there are two groups of escalators to daily cigarette smoking: 1) early escalators who are daily smokers before age 20 years, and 2) later escalators (become daily smokers at 21+ years). This proposal will explore the long-term role of ENDS in changing the escalation and quitting of cigarette smoking using the first four waves of the national Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) longitudinal study. The study used a four stage stratified area probability design and has enrolled ~26,000 people under the age of 35 years, half of whom were female. The public use data for the first two waves are available and include longitudinal weighting variables. Wave 3 is expected to be publicly available in Spring 2018, and Wave 4 one is expected year later. The weighted response for Wave 2 was 87% for 12-17 year olds, and 83% for adults. With these PATH data, we will explore two scientific premises: 1) that widespread promotion of ENDS has resulted in a new generation of nicotine users who rely on ENDS usage and who did not escalate to daily cigarette smokers when becoming adults; and 2) that the diffusion of ENDS among young tobacco users will result in lower nicotine dependence that, in turn, will be associated with higher rates of successful discontinuance of cigarette smoking before age 35 years. A significant methodological weakness in such complex longitudinal analyses is related to the consideration of a large number of time-varying confounding variables that are prognostic for changes in tobacco use behaviors and are also associated with the outcome of interest. Some epidemiological methods allow the achievement of covariate balance between different exposure groups. With these methods, ongoing differences in outcomes of interest are directly attributable to ENDS usage, for example. In this context, we leverage Propensity Score Matching (PSM), and Marginal Structural Models (MSMs) to adjust for time-varying confounding. We will also explore Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE) techniques to optimize the performance of PSM. We will conduct separate analyses for early escalators, late escalators, and quitters before age 35 years. This proposal will answer an urgent public health question in regards to the long-term potential benefits associated with ENDS usage, while also providing an example to the tobacco research field of state-of-art epidemiological methods for complex longitudinal analyses. Project Narrative Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS) appear to be changing the product pattern through which young people become nicotine dependent.

"User-driven Retrospectively Supervised Classification Updating (RESCU) system for robust upper limb prosthesis control ABSTRACT Approximately 41,000 individuals live with upper-limb loss (loss of at least one hand) in the US. Fortunately, prosthetic devices have advanced considerably in the past decades with the development of dexterous, anthropomorphic hands. However, potentially the most promising used control strategy, myoelectric control, lacks a correspondingly high-level of performance and hence the use of dexterous hands remains highly limited. The need for a complete overhaul in upper limb prosthesis control is well highlighted by the abandonment rates of myoelectric devices, which can reach up to 40% in the case of trans-humeral amputees. The area of research that has received the most focus over the past decade has been “pattern recognition,” which is a signal processing based control method that uses multi-channel surface electromyography as the control input. While pattern recognition provides intuitive operation of multiple prosthetic degrees of freedom, it lacks robustness and requires frequent, often daily calibration. Thus, it has not yet achieved the desired clinical acceptance. Our team proposes clinical translation of a novel highly adaptive upper limb prosthesis control system that incorporates two major advances: 1) machine learning (robust classification by implementing a non-boundary based algorithm), and 2) training by retrospectively incorporating user data from activities of daily living (ADL). The proposed system will enable machine intelligence with user input for prosthesis control. Our work is organized as follows: Phase I: (a) First, we will implement a fundamentally new machine intelligence technique, Extreme Learning Machine with Adaptive Sparse Representation Classification (EASRC), that is more resilient to untrained noisy conditions that users may encounter in the real-world and requires less data than traditional myoelectric signal processing. (b) In parallel, we will implement an adaptive learning algorithm, Nessa, which allows users to relabel misclassified data recorded during use and then update the EASRC classifier to adapt to any major extrinsic or intrinsic changes in the signals. Taken together, EASRC and Nessa comprise the Retrospectively Supervised Classification Updating (RESCU) system. Once, the RESCU implementation is complete, we will optimize the system through a joint effort with Johns Hopkins University, and complete an iterative benchtop RESCU evaluation with a focus group of 3 amputee subjects and their prosthetists. Phase II: Verification and validation of RESCU will be completed, culminating in third-party validation testing and certification. Finally, we will complete a clinical assessment including self-reporting subjective measures, and real-world usage metrics in a long-term clinical study. PROJECT NARRATIVE In this project, we aim to empower the user by bringing them into the control loop of their prosthesis and improve the stability of their control strategy over time. Specifically, we implement to a robust classifier, an adaptive learning algorithm, and a smartwatch interface, which allows the user to teach their device when it misunderstands the commands that the user is sending to control the prosthesis. This will result in improved control without cumbersome or time-consuming effort on the part of the user and, more importantly, we hope that it will give the user a greater sense of empowerment and ownership over their prosthesis.",User-driven Retrospectively Supervised Classification Updating (RESCU) system for robust upper limb prosthesis control,10078697,U44NS108894,"['Activities of Daily Living ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' daily living functionality ', ' functional ability ', ' functional capacity ', ' Adoption ', ' Algorithms ', ' Amputees ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Award ', ' Calibration ', ' Certification ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communication ', ' Electromyography ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Freedom ', ' Liberty ', ' Goals ', ' Hand ', ' Joints ', ' Methods ', ' Ownership ', ' Parents ', ' Research ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Supervision ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Prosthetic device ', ' Prosthetics ', ' Prosthesis ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Surface ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Intuition ', ' Individual ', ' satisfaction ', ' Systems Integration ', ' Artificial Extremities ', ' Artificial Limbs ', ' prosthetic limb ', ' Limb Prosthesis ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Performance ', ' novel ', ' empowerment ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Devices ', ' Membrum superius ', ' Upper Limb ', ' Upper Extremity ', ' Data ', ' Pattern Recognition ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' Update ', ' Validation ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' Consumption ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' function improvement ', ' functional improvement ', ' verification and validation ', ' operation ', ' signal processing ', ' prosthetic control ', ' prosthesis control ', ' myoelectric control ', ' adaptive learning ', ' clinical translation ', ' smartwatch ', ' smart watch ', ' learning algorithm ', ' smart algorithm ', ' intelligent algorithm ', ' ']",NINDS,"INFINITE BIOMEDICAL TECHNOLOGIES, LLC",U44,2020,64079,MD-07,0.05067815640548454
"Prospective Health Outcomes and Inflammatory Biomarkers Associated with e-Cigarette Use Project Summary. This project is designed to identify validated biomarkers for use in the assessment of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) by the FDA. Since the introduction of ENDS, commonly referred to as e-cigarettes, there has been a large increase in ENDS use among young adults and older traditional cigarette smokers who also use ENDS (dual users). Since 2016, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has had regulatory authority over ENDS, and there is an acute need for ENDS-related biomarkers that can be used as validated surrogate endpoints for evaluation of new ENDS products. With the goal of validated biomarker discovery in two independent cohorts, the COPDGene and UCSD ENDS studies, we propose to identify ENDS-related inflammatory biomarkers in ENDS only and dual users and relate these biomarkers to five-year lung health outcomes. COPDGene is an ongoing, longitudinal study of >6,000 current and former traditional cigarette (t-cig) smokers enriched for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with detailed longitudinal lung phenotyping data (including chest CT), genome-wide blood RNA-seq, and proteomic data. The UCSD ENDS Study is a controlled study of young ENDS only users and controls with detailed assessment of inflammatory biomarkers in the oropharynx, airways and blood.  Biomarkers used as validated surrogate measures must be 1) associated with ENDS use, 2) predictive of health outcomes, and 3) have a strong biological rationale. We hypothesize that inflammatory biomarkers of ENDS use will be predictive of five-year lung health effects. In Aim 1 of this proposal, discovery of inflammatory transcriptomic and proteomic biomarkers of ENDS exposure will be performed in subjects from the COPDGene five-year study visit, and biomarkers will be validated in two independent sets of subjects from the COPDGene ten-year visit and the UCSD ENDS Study. In Aim 2 we will identify antibody-specific adaptive immune response biomarkers of ENDS exposure using adaptive immune receptor repertoire sequencing (AIRR-seq). Auto-antibodies are biomarkers that are associated with the degree of lung damage in COPD. AIRR-seq is a powerful tool for inflammatory biomarker discovery that characterizes an individual’s decades-long history of antibody responses. In Aim 3 we will use machine learning predictive models to relate ENDS-associated biomarker panels to five-year lung health outcomes from COPDGene. The investigative team for this grant is well-positioned to identify novel inflammatory biomarkers of ENDS use. The COPDGene and UCSD cohorts have the detailed lung phenotyping and molecular characterization necessary to discover and clinically validate biomarkers in two important populations of ENDS users, i.e. ENDS only and dual users. Public Health Relevance: Since the introduction of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), commonly referred to as e-cigarettes, there has been a large increase in ENDS use among young adults and older traditional cigarette smokers who also use ENDS (dual users).

"Mobilize Center: Models for Mobile Sensing and Precision Rehabilitation Limited mobility due to conditions like osteoarthritis (OA), cerebral palsy, and Parkinson’s disease affects millions of individuals, at enormous personal and societal cost. Rehabilitation can dramatically improve mobility and function, but current rehabilitation practice requires in-person guidance by a skilled clinician, increasing expense and limiting access. Mobile sensing technologies are now ubiquitous and have the potential to measure patient function and guide treatment outside the clinic, but they currently fail to capture the characteristics of motion required to accurately monitor function and customize treatment. Millions of low-cost mobile sensors are generating terabytes of data that could be analyzed in combination with other data, such as images, clinical records, and video, to enable studies of unprecedented scale, but machine learning models for analyzing these large-scale, heterogeneous, time-varying data are lacking.  To address these challenges, we will establish a Biomedical Technology Resource Center —The Mobilize Center. Through the leadership of an experienced scientific team, we will create and disseminate innovative tools to quantify movement biomechanics with mobile sensors.  Specifically, we will:  1. Push the bounds of what we can measure via wearable sensors using models that compute muscle  and joint forces and metabolic cost of locomotion. These models, based on biomechanical and machine  learning models, will be disseminated via our newly created OpenSense software, which will be used  by thousands of researchers to gain new insights into patient biomechanics using mobile sensors.  2. Meet the need for tools that analyze data about movement dynamics and develop machine learning  models to analyze and generate insights from unstructured, high-dimensional data, including time-  series (e.g., from mobile sensors), images (e.g., MRI), and video (e.g., smartphone video of a patient’s gait).  3. Provide tools needed to intervene in the real-world. We will develop algorithms to accurately quantify  kinematics outside the lab for long durations using data from inertial measurement units (IMUs). We will  also build behavioral models to adapt and personalize goal setting, drawing on movement records from  6 million individuals, as well as health goals and exercise for 1.7 million people.  Through intensive interactions with our Collaborative Projects, we will focus on improving rehabilitation outcomes for individuals with limited mobility due to osteoarthritis, obesity, Parkinson’s disease, and cerebral palsy. The Center’s tools and services will enable researchers to revolutionize how we diagnose, monitor, and treat mobility disorders, providing tools needed to deliver precision rehabilitation at low cost and on a massive scale in the future.

"Leveraging Artificial Intelligence for the assessment of severity of depressive symptoms Depression is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide, affecting an estimated 300 million people. Evidence-based treatments are available and measurement-based care has been described as the gold standard. Monitoring of depressive symptoms is currently performed with self-administered and interview- based assessment methods conducted by clinicians in their offices. However, the shortage of mental health specialists and the limited resources available to primary care physicians who often manage patients with depression, prevent close monitoring of symptoms delaying optimal treatment potentially prolonging suffering. Passive recording of behavioral data (gathering information without individual's direct input) has been identified as a potentially feasible method for long-term monitoring of depression. To date, most studies have collected passive behavioral data in ""real time"" through mobile apps (i.e. accelerometer, phone clicks) with the goal of identifying potential markers of depression. However, this method lacks critical biological indicators of depression, including sleep, arousal, and motion. Recent development in wristband sensor technology developed by out lab has allowed to measure physiological parameters like gait, heart rate variability (HRV) and electrodermal activity (EDA) continuously in “real time”, allowing a broader anatomical and neurophysiological understanding of emotion, behavior, and cognition in mood disorders as they occur during routine activity. During the past decade, along with the development of sensors, we have seen the progressive use of machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence that enables the detection of complex patterns in multimodal data, allowing the development of complex models. The combination of sensor technology and machine learning allows detailed measurement in real time of a wealth of behaviors predicting mood variation. Over the past 2 years, our interdisciplinary team, including one of the leading lab on depression research, and one of the most innovative lab on affective computing, has conducted a study applying machine learning analytics to create a model combining wristband sensors data and phone- based passive measurements to assess severity of depressive symptoms. In our pilot study with depressed patients monitored over 8 weeks, we found that an algorithm based on biological and behavioral sensor data could estimate depression severity evaluated by a clinician with high accuracy. The proposed study will further refine our model in a sample of 100 adults with depression, assessed over 12 weeks. We anticipate that the proposed study will enable the development of an objective, passive, sensor-based algorithm able to measure depressive symptom severity. The identification of reliable, objective, passive assessment of depressive symptoms with biosensors will have significant ramifications for the monitoring of depression, early detection of response, remission and relapse and ultimately contribute to the advancement of precision medicine. Narrative  The proposed project will create a novel method to assess depressive symptoms by harnessing modern machine learning analytics, phone sensors, and wrist-band sensors. Measurement-based treatment is considered optimal and the development of a valid passive, objective, behavioral and biological assessment of depressive symptoms that does not rely on clinician interviews will improve monitoring and ultimately improve treatment significantly. Ultimately, the ability to leverage a remarkable wealth of behavioral and biological data has the potential to transform the delivery of treatment for depression.",Leveraging Artificial Intelligence for the assessment of severity of depressive symptoms,9839684,R01MH118274,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Arousal ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Behavior ', ' Cognition ', ' Communication ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Emotions ', ' Gait ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Interview ', ' Melancholias ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Moods ', ' Motion ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Self Administration ', ' Self-Administered ', ' Sleep ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Temperature ', ' Time ', ' Wrist ', ' Measures ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Specialist ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Physical activity ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' Remission ', ' Disease remission ', ' information gathering ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' behavioral measure ', ' behavioral measurement ', ' behavior measurement ', ' biological sensor ', ' Biosensor ', ' novel ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' portability ', ' behavioral assessment ', ' Behavior assessment ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' predict therapeutic response ', ' predict therapy response ', ' predict treatment response ', ' therapy prediction ', ' treatment prediction ', ' treatment response prediction ', ' Prediction of Response to Therapy ', ' Monitor ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' Evidence based treatment ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' heart rate variability ', ' mobile app ', ' mobile application ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' precision medicine ', ' anxious ', ' depressed patient ', ' accelerometry ', ' activity monitor ', ' activity tracker ', ' Accelerometer ', ' sensing technology ', ' sensor technology ', ' wearable electronics ', ' wearable technology ', ' wearable device ', ' optimal therapies ', ' optimal treatments ', ' affective computing ', ' multi-modal data ', ' multi-modal datasets ', ' multimodal datasets ', ' multimodal data ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,532467,MA-08,-0.0044986750420359595
"Development/Commercialization of a Sensing Device to Detect Vaping Development/Commercialization of a Sensing Device to Detect Vaping Summary The use of e-cigarettes or vaping has been steadily increasing since its introduction. While potentially a tool to wean cigarette smokers from combustible tobacco, one consequence of the introduction of these devices has been the adoption of vaping by adolescents. While companies that offer vaping instruments for sale note that their material is directed to adults and intended as an aid for smoking cessation, recent reports have demonstrated that middle school and high school students in many countries, some as young as thirteen, have taken to vaping. Data analysis from a 2015 study in the U.S. indicated that 16% of high school students and 5% of middle school students reported vaping in the past thirty days. Most researchers speculated that the number of users would increase from these baselines and evidence indicates that this prediction is correct. Anecdotal evidence indicates that vaping in middle school and high school bathrooms is a major problem. FreshAir Sensor currently sells tobacco and marijuana smoking sensors along with 24/7 monitoring of the devices. The company has leveraged the knowledge of sensor development to produce preliminary components of an early stage sensing system capable of detecting vaping. Preliminary data to demonstrate this accomplishment is provided. The fast track research described in this proposal will enable the optimization of the sensor as well as commercialization of the resulting instrument in minimal time. The need to reduce and eventually eliminate adolescent vaping is urgent. The deployment of the proposed device in schools and other educational institutions will eliminate vaping during school hours and will, therefore, contribute to improvements in the overall health of adolescents by curtailing nicotine intake. Narrative Vaping has become a problem in schools with students, in steadily increasing numbers, using bathrooms and other less monitored spaces to indulge in the use of the newest vaping hardware. FreshAir Sensor is developing a sensor to detect vaping in otherwise unmonitored spaces. The use of this sensing system has the potential to reduce and, eventually, eliminate vaping behavior in schools, thereby reducing the harmful effects of nicotine in adolescents.",Development/Commercialization of a Sensing Device to Detect Vaping,10092402,R44DA049595,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Air ', ' Algorithms ', ' Behavior ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Electronics ', ' electronic device ', ' Engineering ', ' Fatigue ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Goals ', ' Humidity ', ' Laboratories ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Marijuana ', ' marihuana ', ' Marijuana Smoking ', ' Cannabis Smoking ', ' Methods ', ' Minor ', ' Neurotoxins ', ' neurotoxicant ', ' Nicotine ', ' Polymers ', ' Production ', ' Public Housing ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' Development and Research ', ' R & D ', ' R&D ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Sales ', ' Schools ', ' Science ', ' Smoking ', ' Specificity ', ' Students ', ' Temperature ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' Weaning ', ' smoking cessation ', ' cease smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' stop smoking ', ' Film ', ' base ', ' detector ', ' sensor ', ' Phase ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Adolescent ', ' Chemicals ', ' Exposure to ', ' Morphology ', ' tool ', ' Cigarette Smoker ', ' instrument ', ' Knowledge ', ' Hour ', ' Event ', ' System ', ' Tobacco smoking ', ' Tobacco smoking behavior ', ' Country ', ' monitoring device ', ' vapor ', ' high school ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Modality ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' junior high ', ' middle school ', ' junior high school ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Intake ', ' Monitor ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' prototype ', ' commercialization ', ' Junior High School Student ', ' Junior High Student ', ' Middle School Student ', ' Secondary School Student ', ' Secondary Student ', ' High School Student ', ' e-cig ', ' e-cigarette ', ' ecig ', ' ecigarette ', ' Electronic cigarette ', ' vaping ', ' adolescent health ', ' sensing technology ', ' sensor technology ', ' e-cig use ', ' e-cigarette use ', ' ecig use ', ' ecigarette use ', ' electronic cigarette use ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' JUUL ', ' ']",NIDA,FRESHAIR SENSOR CORPORATION,R44,2020,830874,NH-02,0.0008636839521558062
"Development of a Wheelchair Maintenance Alert Application for Elderly Wheelchair Users Project Summary Elderly wheelchair users experience wheelchair breakdowns every 2-3 months in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and rural areas of high-income countries. One in three breakdowns leads to adverse physical, social, psychosocial and economic consequences to wheelchair users which increases the public health and personal burden. Preventative wheelchair maintenance has been found to reduce the frequency of wheelchair breakdowns by ten-fold, but compliance with maintenance recommendations is extremely low because they are generic and not reflective of how and where the wheelchair is being used. To address this issue, we are developing a low-cost, scalable maintenance application that leverages artificial intelligence tools to provide maintenance recommendations tailored to how a wheelchair is used. The availability of low-cost technology and widespread use of smartphones by the elderly and people with disabilities in LMICs has led us to develop a smartphone application called WheelTrak that measures wheelchair wear as a function of usage in community. Based on the wear factors, the application produces a Wheelchair Wear Index (WWI) that is representative of wear of critical wheelchair parts that are prone to breakdown. Once a WWI threshold is reached, maintenance is required, and the application notifies the user and/or caregiver who can conduct maintenance to avoid breakdowns and related health consequences. We will conduct a data collection study in collaboration with our wheelchair industry partner – UCP Wheels in El Salvador – and characterize the WWI for the elderly by tracking wear factors which include user’s travel distance, ground shocks and surface vibrations using WheelTrak and a wheel sensor. Based on the trained WWI algorithm, a preventative maintenance schedule will be developed for older adults that can be employed through WheelTrak for maintenance reminders. Semi-structured interviews will be conducted to evaluate the usability of the application and gather barriers to maintenance. User feedback will assist us in improving WheelTrak for greater user satisfaction and compliance with maintenance, and addressing any personal or logistical challenges that elderly users and their caregivers or family members may face with conducting maintenance activities in LMICs. Findings from the proposed studies in this application will assist us in planning future studies to investigate the WWI-enabled WheelTrak tool as an intervention to prevent or reduce breakdowns and health consequences with the elderly in LMICs. Preventative maintenance of wheelchairs is necessary to reduce frequent wheelchair breakdowns and corresponding health consequences experienced by the elderly in adverse environments which are commonly present in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). WheelTrak is a smartphone application that measures real-time wheelchair wear in the community during use and triggers preventative maintenance reminders. In this study, we are modelling the application algorithm and collecting user and caregiver feedback to transform WheelTrak into a maintenance intervention tool for elderly wheelchair users in LMICs.",Development of a Wheelchair Maintenance Alert Application for Elderly Wheelchair Users,10095020,R03AG069836,"['Cause of Death ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' decubitus ulcer ', ' Bed Sores ', ' Bedsore ', ' Pressure Sore ', ' Pressure Ulcer ', ' pressure injury ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Economics ', ' El Salvador ', ' Environment ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Handicapped ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' disabled ', ' disabled individual ', ' disabled people ', ' individuals with disabilities ', ' Health ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' indexing ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Interview ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' extended care ', ' longterm care ', ' Maintenance ', ' Study models ', ' Names ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Public Health ', ' Recommendation ', ' Risk ', ' Shock ', ' Circulatory Collapse ', ' circulatory shock ', ' Societies ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' User Compliance ', ' Wheelchairs ', ' Wheel Chairs ', ' mobile assistance device ', ' mobile assistance system ', ' mobile assistive device ', ' mobile assistive system ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Family member ', ' Schedule ', ' injuries ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' rural region ', ' rural area ', ' sensor ', ' Mechanical Wheelchairs ', ' Nonpowered Wheelchairs ', ' Manual wheelchair ', ' improved ', ' Surface ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Failure ', ' Logistics ', ' satisfaction ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Notification ', ' Frequencies ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' Country ', ' vibration ', ' psychosocial ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' Devices ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Provider ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Data ', ' Monitor ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cost ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' prospective ', ' usability ', ' evidence base ', ' industrial partnership ', ' industry partnership ', ' industry partner ', ' LMIC ', ' low and middle-income countries ', ' Android App ', ' Android Application ', ' Cell Phone Application ', ' Cell phone App ', ' Cellular Phone App ', ' Cellular Phone Application ', ' Smart Phone App ', ' Smart Phone Application ', ' Smartphone App ', ' iOS app ', ' iOS application ', ' iPhone App ', ' iPhone Application ', ' smartphone Application ', ' sensing technology ', ' sensor technology ', ' Activities of Daily Living ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' daily living functionality ', ' functional ability ', ' functional capacity ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Beds ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R03,2020,75877,PA-18,0.028665706648021688
"An Unobtrusive Continuous Cuff-less Blood Pressure Monitor for Nocturnal Hypertension PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The objective of this project is to create an unobtrusive, wrist-worn, cuff-less blood pressure monitor for measurement and identification of nocturnal nondipping hypertension. The investigation includes extensive validation with state-of-the-art ambulatory blood pressure monitors at nighttime in presence of heterogeneous treatment paradigms. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one of the major causes of ailments worldwide. Hypertension alone affects one in three adults according to the World Health Organization. Therefore, monitoring blood pressure has become a critical part of healthcare as it is known to be linked to many CVDs. Traditionally, clinical practitioners have relied on the mercury-based (or digital equivalent) inflatable cuff-based sphygmomanometer. However, the nature of the device allows for only infrequent measurements and its somewhat invasive nature and associated discomfort prohibits additional nocturnal measurements. There is certainly a value to measuring blood pressure continuously in the natural context of the user’s environment, in particular during sleep, without being disturbed by the instrument. Our proposed technology can provide a wealth of information to physicians, help identify certain short-term dynamics/variations of blood pressure, and allow effective monitoring of response to medication, among other things. Nocturnal measurements provide additional prognostic value in identifying risk. Despite these benefits, no wearable, non-invasive device for continuous blood pressure monitoring exists on the market simply because none have been reliable enough to be considered clinical grade. This project aims to develop a robust and reliable blood pressure monitor in the form of a wrist-worn device that uses bio-impedance sensors, and for the first time, demonstrate clinical grade reliability. These sensors measure pulse wave velocity (PWV) along with several other derivatives for cardiovascular parameters including heart rate and blood volume changes in arteries, which correlate with the blood pressure. The system will incorporate clever hardware design to localize underlying vasculature and focus on arterial sites for enhanced accuracy. The device will include a motion sensor to take into account the user’s movements and motion artifacts, the contact quality, and reliability of the measurements. Advanced machine learning techniques, leveraging both general and personalized models, will be developed to convert bio-impedance measurements to blood pressure. This project aims to then validate the system and analytics in both a healthy patient cohort and a hypertensive cohort, learning the impact that nocturnal ‘nondipping’ hypertension and anti-hypertensive treatments have on PWV/other cardiovascular correlates and blood pressure estimates. After decades of relying on the inflatable cuff- based technique, this system could represent a significant change in how we measure blood pressure. PROJECT NARRATIVE Continuous monitoring of nocturnal blood pressure can help early diagnosis of developing cardiac conditions, reveal short term blood pressure variations, and also help the physician monitor differences in variations in response to medication for hypertensive patients. Moreover, the comfort and convenience of a wearable monitor would allow measurement in the natural context of daily life, including important nocturnal measurements, and reduce the burden of adherence on the user. The system will also provide feedback on quality of measurements to allow the users or care-givers to gauge reliability.",An Unobtrusive Continuous Cuff-less Blood Pressure Monitor for Nocturnal Hypertension,9998433,R01HL151240,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Antihypertensive Agents ', ' Anti-Hypertensive Agents ', ' Anti-Hypertensive Drugs ', ' Anti-Hypertensives ', ' Antihypertensive Drugs ', ' Antihypertensives ', ' Hypotensive Agent ', ' Hypotensive Drugs ', ' Hypotensives ', ' Arteries ', ' Awareness ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Blood Pressure Monitors ', ' Continuous Sphygmomanometers ', ' Blood Volume ', ' Calibration ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Data Collection ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Environment ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Gold ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Mercury ', ' Hg element ', ' Methods ', ' Structural Models ', ' Motion ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Legal patent ', ' Patents ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Physiology ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Sleep ', ' Sleep Deprivation ', ' deficient sleep ', ' inadequate sleep ', ' insufficient sleep ', ' sleep debt ', ' sleep deficiency ', ' sleep deficit ', ' sleep insufficiency ', ' sleep loss ', ' Supine Position ', ' Dorsal Position ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' World Health Organization ', ' Wrist ', ' Measures ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' Electrical Impedance ', ' Impedance ', ' electric impedance ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' sensor ', ' Sphygmomanometers ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Penetration ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' Blood flow ', ' insight ', ' Measurement ', ' Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring ', ' instrument ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Pulse ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Investigation ', ' Hour ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' monitoring device ', ' cohort ', ' arterial stiffening ', ' artery stiffening ', ' artery stiffness ', ' arterial stiffness ', ' Proxy ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Devices ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' performance tests ', ' response ', ' model development ', ' Skin ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Microfabrication ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' Cardiac ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' digital ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' willingness ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' FDA approved ', ' sleep position ', ' non-prone sleep ', ' supine sleep ', ' Regimen ', ' Patient risk ', ' prognostic ability ', ' prognostic power ', ' prognostic utility ', ' prognostic value ', ' stratified patient ', ' patient stratification ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' patient subsets ', ' body sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' wearable sensor ', ' wearable system ', ' wireless sensor technology ', ' wearable sensor technology ', ' wearable electronics ', ' wearable technology ', ' wearable device ', ' motion sensor ', ' advanced analytics ', ' validate effectiveness ', ' effectiveness validation ', ' ']",NHLBI,TEXAS ENGINEERING EXPERIMENT STATION,R01,2020,766675,TX-17,-0.030966112529011335
"Full Scale Randomized Trial of an Innovative Conversational Agent for Smoking Cessation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (DESCRIPTION) Cigarette smoking accounts for 480,000 premature deaths and one third of all cancer deaths annually in the US. There is enormous need for high-impact, cost-effective population-level interventions for smoking cessation. For the past 15 years, mobile phone-delivered text messaging interventions such as the NCI’s SmokefreeTXT have been a prominent technology addressing this need. However, very much like all widely available technologies for smoking cessation (e.g., websites), text messaging interventions have modest quit rates, driven largely by low engagement. Fortunately, a new technology provides a therapeutic conversation to address the problem of engagement that impacts text messaging and other current digital technologies for smoking cessation. Advances in machine learning, natural language processing, and cloud computing are now making it possible to create and widely disseminate conversational agents (CAs), which are computer-powered digital coaches designed to form long-term social-emotional connections with users through conversations. CAs are supportive, empathic, reflectively listen, provide personalized responses, and offer goal setting and advice appropriately timed to the needs of the user. Regarding CAs for smoking cessation, the major knowledge gaps are: (1) their efficacy, (2) theoretical mechanisms, and (3) the cost-effectiveness. Also unexplored are the potential baseline moderators of CAs for smoking cessation. We recently developed a CA for smoking cessation, called “QuitBot,” evaluated it in a diary study, and then tested it in a pilot randomized controlled trial (N = 306), comparing it with the NCI’s SmokefreeTXT. The pilot RCT design was very feasible with 93% three-month follow-up. QuitBot had: (a) high participant engagement and (b) high quit rates at the three-month follow-up—very promising in comparison with SmokefreeTXT. Addressing these knowledge gaps and building on the promising results of our QuitBot research, the project will conduct a randomized controlled trial of QuitBot (n = 760) versus SmokefreeTXT (n = 760) with 12-month follow-up in order to determine whether QuitBot: (1) provides higher quit rates than SmokefreeTXT, (2) has smoking cessation outcomes significantly mediated by therapeutic alliance processes and engagement, and (3) is cost-effective vs. SmokefreeTXT. In addition, this study will explore whether these baseline factors moderate the effectiveness of QuitBot: trust, social support, and demographics (e.g., sex). This innovative project will advance the fields of research on CAs both for smoking cessation in particular and for health behavior change in general— regardless of whether the results are positive or null. Positive results could have high population-level impact and stimulate new lines of research into CA dissemination and implementation, and the adaptation of CAs for multiple subpopulations of smokers, languages, and community and medical settings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT The overall aim of this project is to determine the effectiveness of a conversational agent for smoking cessation. If successful, this intervention can be cost-effectively scaled on a population level, thereby making a high public health impact.",Full Scale Randomized Trial of an Innovative Conversational Agent for Smoking Cessation,9995331,R01CA247156,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Cost Measures ', ' Cost metrics ', ' cost measurement ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Empathy ', ' Goals ', ' Judgment ', ' Language ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Smoking ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Quality-Adjusted Life Years ', ' QALY ', ' Quality-Adjusted Life Expectancy ', ' smoking cessation ', ' cease smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' stop smoking ', ' Mediating ', ' improved ', ' prematurity ', ' premature ', ' Medical ', ' Trust ', ' cigarette use ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' Policies ', ' Sample Size ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Internet ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Smoker ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' diaries ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' behavior change ', ' American ', ' success ', ' Participant ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' social ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Car Phone ', ' smoking cessation treatment ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' anti-smoking ', ' Antismoking ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' feelings ', ' Feeling ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' cost ', ' digital ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Health behavior change ', ' Abstinence ', ' comparative effectiveness ', ' demographics ', ' public health relevance ', ' successful intervention ', ' Randomization trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' arm ', ' Cloud Infrastructure ', ' cloud computer ', ' Cloud Computing ', ' Android App ', ' Android Application ', ' Cell Phone Application ', ' Cell phone App ', ' Cellular Phone App ', ' Cellular Phone Application ', ' Smart Phone App ', ' Smart Phone Application ', ' Smartphone App ', ' iOS app ', ' iOS application ', ' iPhone App ', ' iPhone Application ', ' smartphone Application ', ' short message service ', ' texting ', ' Text Messaging ', ' randomized effectiveness trial ', ' ']",NCI,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2020,730398,WA-07,-0.008504458877042624
"A mobile sensing system to monitor symptoms during chemotherapy Cancer treatments can cause a variety of poorly-managed symptoms and toxicities that can impair quality of life and functioning and lead to early discontinuation of life-prolonging medical treatment. The goals of the proposed study are (1) to develop a novel mobile sensing system to passively monitor symptom burden during chemotherapy and (2) to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of using this system to recommend patient-provider communication. To accomplish Aim 1, we will enroll 200 oncology patients starting a new chemotherapy regimen and will collect smartphone and wearable sensor data continuously as well as daily patient-reported symptoms via smartphones for 90 days. Using machine learning methods, we will retrospectively analyze data from the first 100 participants and develop a generalizable and parsimonious population-level model to identify severe symptom days. For the second 100 participants, we will run these computational models in real-time and prospectively evaluate the accuracy of our classifications relative to patient-reported symptoms. For Aim 2, we will enroll 50 patients in a prospective single-arm trial of a system that uses inferences based on sensing and machine learning to recommend contact with providers and will evaluate patient accrual, attrition, and compliance as well as information from both patients and their providers about acceptability and perceived usefulness of the system. The scientific premise of this proposal is that mobile sensing of subtle fluctuations in behavior coupled with real-time computational modeling could enable earlier detection and ultimately better management of severe symptoms during cancer treatment. The proposed project builds on our prior research and completes the necessary development and feasibility work to support a large multisite trial comparing the mobile sensing system to standard of care to determine effects on symptom burden, quality of life, health care utilization, and survival. Public health relevance: Symptoms during cancer treatment are common, compromise patient quality of life and ability to tolerate treatment, and often go undetected at clinic visits.

"Controlling Locomotion over Continuously Varying Activities for Agile Powered Prosthetic Legs PROJECT ABSTRACT Above-knee amputees often struggle to perform the varying activities of daily life with conventional prostheses. Emerging powered knee-ankle prostheses have motors that can restore normative biomechanics, but these devices are limited to a small set of pre-defined activities that must be tuned to the user by technical experts over several hours. The overall goal of this project is to model and control human locomotion over continuously varying tasks for the design of agile, powered prostheses that require little to no tuning. The universal use of different task-specific controllers in current powered legs is a direct consequence of the prevailing paradigm for viewing human locomotion as a discrete set of activities. There is a fundamental gap in knowledge about how to analyze, model, and control continuously varying locomotion, which greatly limits the adaptability and agility of powered prostheses. The central hypothesis of this project is that continuously varying activities can be represented by a single mathematical model based on measureable physical quantities called task variables. The proposed project will be scientifically significant to understanding how humans continuously adapt to varying activities and environments, technologically significant to the design of agile, user-synchronized powered prosthetic legs, and clinically significant to the adoption of powered knee-ankle prostheses for improved community ambulation. The proposed model of human locomotion will enable new prosthetic strategies for controlling and adapting to the environment, which aligns with the missions of the NICHD/NCMRR Devices and Technology Development program area and the NIBIB Mathematical Modeling, Simulation, and Analysis program. The innovation of this work is encompassed in 1) a continuous paradigm for variable locomotor activities that challenges the existing discrete paradigm, 2) a unified task control methodology that drastically improves the agility of powered prosthetic legs, and 3) a partially automated tuning process that significantly reduces the time and technical expertise required to configure powered knee- ankle prostheses. This continuous task paradigm will provide new methods and models for studying human locomotion across tasks and task transitions. This innovation will address a key roadblock in control technology that currently restricts powered legs to a small set of activities that do not generalize well across users. The adaptability of the proposed control paradigm across users and activities will transform the prosthetics field with a new generation of “plug-and-play” powered legs for community ambulation. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because the clinical application of variable-activity powered prosthetic legs can significantly improve community mobility and therefore quality of life for nearly a million American amputees. Recently developed powered knee-ankle prostheses are limited to a small set of pre- defined activities that require several hours of expert tuning for each user. This project will model and control human locomotion over continuously varying tasks for the design of agile, powered prostheses that require little to no tuning, which aligns with the missions of the Devices and Technology Development program area of the NICHD National Center for Medical Rehabilitation Research and the Mathematical Modeling, Simulation, and Analysis program of the NIBIB.",Controlling Locomotion over Continuously Varying Activities for Agile Powered Prosthetic Legs,9925236,R01HD094772,"['Adoption ', ' Amputees ', ' Ankle ', ' Regio tarsalis ', ' Tarsal Bone ', ' Tarsus ', ' Biomechanics ', ' biomechanical ', ' Communities ', ' Environment ', ' Gait ', ' Goals ', ' Hand ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Joints ', ' Knee ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Lower Extremity ', ' Lower Limb ', ' Membrum inferius ', ' Locomotion ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mission ', ' Study models ', ' Motion ', ' Motor Activity ', ' Locomotor Activity ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Orthotic Devices ', ' Orthosis ', ' orthotics ', ' Play ', ' Program Development ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Running ', ' Spinal cord injury ', ' Spinal Cord Trauma ', ' Spinal Trauma ', ' Spinal cord injured ', ' Traumatic Myelopathy ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Technical Expertise ', ' technical skills ', ' Walking ', ' Prosthetic device ', ' Prosthetics ', ' Prosthesis ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Human Figure ', ' Human body ', ' Electrical Engineering ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Hour ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' System ', ' Leg Prosthesis ', ' prosthetic leg ', ' Artificial Leg ', ' Medical center ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' human data ', ' exoskeletal ', ' exoskeleton ', ' success ', ' tech development ', ' technology development ', ' kinematic model ', ' kinematics ', ' Speed ', ' Devices ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematic model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematical model ', ' Leg ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' device development ', ' instrument development ', ' Device or Instrument Development ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Measurable ', ' Motor ', ' NICHD ', "" National Institute of Children's Health and Human Development "", ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' rehab research ', ' rehabilitation research ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' NIBIB ', ' National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinically significant ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' clinical applicability ', ' clinical application ', ' temporal resolution ', ' time measurement ', ' temporal measurement ', ' prosthetic control ', ' prosthesis control ', ' powered prosthesis ', ' Degree program ', ' Gait speed ', ' robotic control ', ' robot control ', ' model of human ', ' human model ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2020,446707,MI-12,0.021340182778557343
"A framework for developing translatable intelligent neural interface systems for precision neuromodulation therapies Despite advances in neuromodulation technology, therapeutic devices are often ineffective or have adverse side effects. Next-generation closed-loop neuromodulation systems will provide great potentials for improving the therapeutic outcome by sensing the neural states and adapting the neuromodulatory actions. These systems will provide powerful tools for understanding the mechanisms of treatment by elucidating the causal link between regulating the physiological states and the therapeutic or the behavioral outcomes. However, a lack of systematic approach to optimally control neurostimulation is a major barrier to fully utilize their potentials. Furthermore, the real-time implementation of advanced optimization and control algorithms requires powerful computing hardware that pose a major challenge for translating the effective neural interface systems into implantable or wearable devices with limited power supply. The proposed project is addressing these two problems by developing an open-source end-to-end platform, called NeuroWeaver, to design, test and deploy intelligent Closed-Loop Neuromodulation (iCLON) systems that automatically can learn the optimal neuromodulation control policies by interacting with the nervous system. We cast the problem of optimizing neuromodulation into reward-based learning where achieving the desired neural state or the therapeutic outcome represents a measure of reward for the iCLON system. We will use techniques from reinforcement learning and model predictive control to develop algorithms that enable iCLON systems learn the optimal actions to maximize their reward. Memory dysfunction is one of the most devastating symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease and age-related dementia. We will develop the NeuroWeaver platform in the context of designing iCLON systems to induce good memory states in the hippocampus by closed-loop amygdala stimulation. Optimizing the memory- enhancing effects of amygdala stimulation will have immediate benefits to research on treatments for memory disorders. More broadly, the NeuroWeaver platform can be combined with a wide range of biological sensors and actuators to design intelligent closed-loop control systems for regulating physiological processes far beyond the proposed application in this proposal. Our proposed platform will have the potential to create an open-source ecosystem for collaboration between machine learning, neuroscience, and computer architecture communities as well as provide tools for further enrichment of the algorithms and broader utilization in the biomedical domain. The goal of this project is developing a platform for designing therapeutic devices with artificial intelligence to enable automatic optimization of neuromodulation for precision therapies.

"Automating and Obtaining FDA Approval for a Digital Intervention for Depression Phase IIB Abstract -FINAL A large body of evidence supports the idea that disruptions in the regularity of behavioral routines (or ‘social rhythms’) can lead to the onset of mood symptoms and full-blown episodes via their impact on endogenous circadian rhythms and, conversely, that stable social routines protect against new mood episodes. Based on our conviction that monitoring, evaluating, and increasing the regularity of behavioral rhythms has broad applicability for improving mental health, we established HealthRhythms, Inc. (www.healthrhythms.com) with the goal of using mobile technology to enhance our capacity to monitor and treat such conditions, with a particular emphasis on mood disorders. Our product vision capitalizes on the ubiquity and intimacy of smartphones and their capacity to automatically and continuously sense parameters of behavior that represent key indicators of depressive symptomatology captured on a 24/7 basis in the user’s natural environment. It also capitalizes on the capacity of smartphones to deliver interventions that are easily accessible, can be delivered with optimal timing and, perhaps most important, are enormously scalable. Finally, smartphone technology gives us the capacity to bring empirically validated psychosocial interventions to the hundreds of thousands of depressed patients who otherwise would not be able to access such interventions and, thus, speed their recovery and prevent relapse. Under the auspices of our Phase II SBIR funding (R44MH113520-01-02), we have developed both such a monitoring product (Measure) and have developed and tested such a digital intervention platform (Cue). Analyses conducted to date indicate that Cue leads to significantly greater decreases in depressive symptomatology than monitoring alone via Measure. We now propose to: 1) upgrade to Cue and its accompanying clinician dashboard to be commercially marketable and 2) carry out the clinical trial necessary for FDA licensing of Cue 2.0 as a mobile device. Cue 2.0 will include enhanced designs, more in-depth psychoeducational material, and a fully automated engine for delivering behavior change suggestions to improve the regularity of users’ social and behavioral routines.

"Ghost in the Machine: Melding Brain, Computer and Behavior Implantable devices are playing a greater role in neurologic care, but their effectiveness is limited, because they are blind to human thoughts, feelings, and behavior – factors that most dramatically affect our health. Coupling peripheral sensors to implants might help, but wouldn’t it be easier if the devices just asked us? Armed with this knowledge, next generation machines will more effectively drive neural activity in the brain to healthy states. They will also quickly learn behaviors that worsen health and guide us to better choices. Though DARPA, the NIH, and Neuralink are spending millions of dollars on new hardware for brain-computer interfaces, none focus on reciprocal, natural communication between host and machine. There is a desperate need for novel, practical methods that enable devices to learn from and guide human behavior.  In this application I propose to develop a new generation of autonomous brain-machine interfaces – devices that can question, record, act - and combine learning algorithms applied to neurosignals with teaching by their human hosts. Life with these implants will entail a subtle human- machine dialogue in which devices and humans teach and learn from each other. Humans will inform intelligent algorithms about what we are doing and feeling, while machines will incorporate this information into therapy and guide us to optimize quality of life in personalized ways. This is a paradigm shift from today’s simple devices, which are programmed by physicians during occasional office visits. I propose to demonstrate this paradigm in a practical, scalable way using current epilepsy implants that is rapidly translatable to many neurological disorders.  To achieve this goal, I will meld several cutting-edge technologies in novel ways, including: (1) State-of-the-art, high bandwidth implantables that sample neural activity, link to vast cloud- based computational power to process it, and intervene to modulate brain, spinal cord or peripheral neural activity. This work utilizes my experience from the past 20 years; (2) I will deploy powerful new computer science tools in novel ways. I will use convolutional neural nets (a.k.a. Deep Learning) to learn patterns from vast streams of continuous high-bandwidth neural data, build a two way human-machine interface using Natural Language Processing (NLP)., and probe networks with changes in human behavior and electrical stimulation and guide interventions toward therapeutic goals using Reinforcement Learning. Combining these computer science, machine learning techniques and measurements of human behavior is a new area of investigation for me that will leverage my unique background in clinical neurology and engineering to build a new class of interactive, human therapeutic devices. The goal of this project is to develop a revolutionary, new generation of implantable neurodevices that will communicate with, learn from, and teach their human hosts to better treat disease. Current implantable devices are blind to human actions, thoughts and behavior, which limits their effectiveness. State of the art computer techniques that can measure behavior and link them to brain activity will empower patients to teach, control and learn from their devices to improve health and quality of life.","Ghost in the Machine: Melding Brain, Computer and Behavior",10012013,DP1NS122038,"['Affect ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Communication ', ' Computers ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electric Stimulation ', ' Electrical Stimulation ', ' electrostimulation ', ' Engineering ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' implantable device ', ' biomedical implant ', ' implant device ', ' indwelling device ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurology ', ' Office Visits ', ' physician office visit ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Spinal Cord ', ' Medulla Spinalis ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Technology ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' User-Computer Interface ', ' human computer interface ', ' human machine interface ', ' man machine interface ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Caring ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Peripheral ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Link ', ' Measurement ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Investigation ', ' Stream ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' experience ', ' computer science ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Data ', ' Process ', ' feelings ', ' Feeling ', ' next generation ', ' brain computer interface ', ' brain machine interface ', ' blind ', ' Coupling ', ' Implant ', ' learning behavior ', ' learned behavior ', ' cloud based ', ' deep learning ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' learning algorithm ', ' smart algorithm ', ' intelligent algorithm ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,DP1,2020,1134000,PA-03,-0.0027890747046929957

"Sensor-based Just-in Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) Targeting Eating Behavior PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Long-term weight control is difficult to achieve and requires permanent changes in eating behavior. Emerging wearable sensor technology enables accurate and objective measurement of ingestive behavior, and real-time analysis of the sensor data paves the way for development of individually tailored and immediately delivered intervention (just-in-time adaptive Intervention; JITAI) to change eating behavior. Grounded in empirically and theoretically supported behavior change strategies for weight control, the proposed project relies on the synergy of wearable sensor technology, machine learning, behavioral science, personalized medicine, and nutrition to deliver and test such JITAIs. We previously developed a wearable sensor, the Automatic Ingestion Monitor (AIM), that automatically and accurately detects eating and characterizes meal microstructure (e.g., eating duration, rate of ingestion). These data can also be used to accurately estimate energy intake. The goals of this project are to: 1) use the AIM to study two common behavioral patterns observed among individuals with overweight/obesity, namely, excessive total daily energy intake (EI) and fast eating rate; 2) define the optimal personalized triggering metrics for two JITAIs targeting these behaviors; and 3) evaluate JITAIs’ effects on daily energy intake and targeted behaviors. In fulfillment of these goals, we will first conduct a study to characterize the target eating behaviors, then simulate and define triggering metrics for personalized JITAIs to change targeted eating behaviors and decrease EI. The JITAIs are rooted in self-regulation theory (SRT): setting a behavioral goal and monitoring progress toward that goal, with feedback to reinforce success. To enable the SRT-informed JITAIs, we will first use the AIM to collect data about ingestive behaviors quantified by objective, sensor-measured metrics from 90 adults with overweight/obesity who will wear the device for one week in free living conditions. Second, using the collected dataset, we will: a) analyze individual curves of cumulative daily EI and rate of eating within eating episodes to define triggering parameters for personalized JITAI delivery, and b) numerically simulate JITAI delivery and effects. We will then conduct a second study to evaluate the immediate effect of JITAIs on EI and ingestive behavior in free living participants. We will conduct a within-subjects trial with 128 adults wearing the AIM for 7 weeks. To personalize JITAIs, the AIM will learn individual eating patterns over a 1-week run-in period. Each JITAI will be delivered for two weeks (weeks 2-3 and 5-6) in a randomized crossover design with the resulting daily EI and ingestive behavior compared to baseline and the acceptability of the JITAIs assessed via questionnaire. On washout weeks 4 and 7, participants will continue to wear the AIM (no JITAIs) to assess persistence of intervention effects. The proposed project is the first step in demonstrating that AIM-based JITAIs can alter a variety of eating behaviors associated with excess EI. PROJECT NARRATIVE Achievement of changes in eating behaviors that facilitate long-term weight loss and maintenance is elusive. Emerging wearable sensor technology allows for accurate and objective measurement of ingestive behavior. Real-time analysis of the sensor data paves the way for individually tailored just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs) based on empirically and theoretically supported behavior change strategies for healthy eating and weight control. The proposed project relies on synergy of wearable sensor technology, machine learning, behavioral science, personalized medicine, and nutrition to test two such JITAIs driven by the Automatic Ingestion Monitor (AIM), a device that automatically detects and characterize eating behavior in real-time.

"Novel Approaches to Advance Coordinated Registry Networks (CRNs). Project Summary The technological transformation of US health care with the explosion of new devices and iterative changes mandates the acquisition of real-world evidence (RWE) to study devices and technologies pragmatically. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has spearheaded the RWE framework development in the pursuit of sufficient evidence that is required for regulatory decision-making such as device approvals and surveillance. With regulatory support since the launch of the National Medical Device Registry Task Force in 2015, the Medical Device Epidemiology Network (MDEpiNet) created 15 national and international coordinated registry networks (CRNs), which develop or link well-curated national RWE sources such as registries, administrative, and electronic health records (EHRs) data. The MDEpiNet is a key partner of the National Evaluation System of Technologies (NEST) coordinating center and is an international public-private partnership focusing on building global infrastructure and methodologies to advance the use of RWE for medical device evaluation. CRNs not only focus on prevention of harms but also the promotion of safer device innovation through the development of study designs that expedites patient recruitment at lower costs than traditional clinical research. MDEpiNet developed a maturity model for CRNs with various levels of achievements in seven key domains: 1) device identification, 2) quality improvement, 3) total product life-cycle, 4) data quality, 5) efficiency, 6) governance and sustainability, 7) patient engagement. This proposal focuses on the creation of innovative tools and methods necessary to achieve maturation of the networks through efficient curation of robust RWE. We will capitalize on established partnerships with registries, professional societies, integrated health systems, and many academic institutions to advance this critical national infrastructure as a foundational component of NEST. We will facilitate advancements of RWE through stakeholder roundtables, patient-facing mobile app development, and continued innovative methods development to link registries with Medicare, commercial, statewide, and EHR data to enable better research and surveillance for devices. Our specific aims facilitate stakeholder engagement for device-specific core minimum data development in women's health, prostate cancer, orthopedics, vascular disease, robot-assisted surgery, and temporomandibular joints. We will also advance and enrich linked data capacities in vascular disease, hernia repair, breast implant, prostate cancer, Women's Health, and gastrointestinal cancer CRNs. Finally, we conduct advanced analytics to determine gender disparities in device outcomes and use machine learning and active surveillance methods in hernia repair, orthopedics, stroke treatment, vascular disease, and Women's health CRNs. The CRN community of practice will enable centralized knowledge sharing to support cross-specialty and technology learning and applications. Through this, we advance the CRNs using innovative, scalable, and dynamic approaches and help them become foundational components of NEST. Narrative Medical Device Epidemiology Network will advance the research and surveillance capabilities of coordinated registry networks through stakeholder roundtables, patient-facing mobile app development, and linkages of real-world data sources.

"Opera Phenix High-Content Imaging System for Drug Discovery PROJECT SUMMARY The University of Pittsburgh Drug Discovery Institute (UPDDI) is requesting funds to purchase the Perkin Elmer OPERA PHENIX high speed, high resolution spinning disk confocal High-Content Screening (HCS) device. The Opera Phenix will replace two Molecular Devices ImageXpress Ultra high content readers purchased in 2008, which are critical to multiple NIH-, DoD-, and Foundation-funded projects at the University of Pittsburgh, but are no longer supported by the manufacturer and have been decommissioned. We have determined that one Opera Phenix instrument can replace the two IXUs. The Phenix is a third generation HCS instrument that will be essential to satisfy the diverse needs of users that the UPDDI serves. No comparable instruments exist at the University of Pittsburgh, the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, and Carnegie Mellon University. Over the last decade, HCS has become a standard in the pharmaceutical industry for target identification, phenotypic screening, as well as toxicology, and in academia for large-scale biological studies, where cell-by- cell quantitation is critical. The UPDDI has been an academic pioneer in the application of HCS and serves an extensive number of collaborators across campus that require and rely on HCS, ranging from neurodegeneration, organ regeneration, cancer, liver diseases, organotypic model development, and traumatic brain injury. Our diverse user groups’ needs emphasize discovery models of physiological relevance and high complexity, and therefore require fast, high resolution 2D, 3D, and kinetic imaging and maximum flexibility in image analysis. The large number of HCS users working in the UPDDI further demands a fast system to permit effective sharing of instrument time, and an integrated database with off-site user access to perform off- line analysis. Key requirements for an HCS imager therefore are superior speed in acquiring z-series of images at high resolution of thick specimens in aqueous matrices, mature yet flexible image algorithms, and seamless integration of instrument software with system, public,and custom-developed UPDDI databases. The only instrument that meets all of these criteria is the Opera Phenix because it has 1) fast laser-based illumination and the ability to acquire multiple channels simultaneously 2) water immersion objectives that eliminate non-matching refractive indices, which limit spherical aberrations of air and oil objectives at longer working distances and require adjustment of correction collars depending on imaging depth; 3) a powerful suite of user-friendly yet flexible image analysis routines including a 3D module, advanced texture and morphology analysis, and intuitive and user-friendly machine learning; and 4) the ability to perform seamless “adaptive high-resolution imaging”, i.e., pre-scanning a large area at low magnification, followed by automated “on-the- fly” switching to higher magnification to acquire high resolution images of user-defined regions of interest. The Opera Phenix is the only instrument on the market that is capable of fulfilling the demands of the University of Pittsburgh’s diverse drug discovery community. PROJECT NARRATIVE Modern drug discovery increasingly demands better and more disease relevant models and the ability to analyze them. High-content screening (HCS) has become indispensable in the analysis of such models as it permits the analysis of cells, their constituents, and interactions in their proper biological context. The third generation HCS instrument, Opera Phenix, produces the quality and quantity of data from cells, tissues and experimental animals that are required for computational and systems biological investigations, while at the same time providing the throughput needed for automated screening.",Opera Phenix High-Content Imaging System for Drug Discovery,9935240,S10OD028450,"['Air ', ' Algorithms ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communities ', ' Drug Industry ', ' Pharmaceutic Industry ', ' Pharmaceutical Industry ', ' Foundations ', ' Institutes ', ' Kinetics ', ' Lasers ', ' Laser Electromagnetic ', ' Laser Radiation ', ' Lighting ', ' Illumination ', ' Liver diseases ', ' Hepatic Disorder ', ' hepatic disease ', ' hepatopathy ', ' liver disorder ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurological degeneration ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' Oils ', ' Phenotype ', ' Refractive Indices ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Time ', ' Toxicology ', ' Universities ', ' Water ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Generations ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Intuition ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Funding ', ' Morphology ', ' instrument ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Scanning ', ' Texture ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' interest ', ' Medical center ', ' aqueous ', ' Speed ', ' Devices ', ' organ regeneration ', ' Brain Trauma ', ' traumatic brain damage ', ' Traumatic Brain Injury ', ' drug discovery ', ' model development ', ' Manufacturer ', ' Manufacturer Name ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' Academia ', ' Reader ', ' Resolution ', ' Molecular ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' physiologic model ', ' user-friendly ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' screening ', ' imaging system ', ' high resolution imaging ', ' imager ', ' Immersion ', ' ']",OD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,S10,2020,1010594,PA-18,-0.03968496339611849
"RAVE: A New Open Software Tool for Analysis and Visualization of Electrocorticography Data Project Summary/Abstract  A fast-growing technique in human neuroscience is electrocorticography (ECOG), the only technique that allows the activity of small population of neurons in the human brain to be directly recorded. We use the term ECOG to refer to the entire range of invasive recording techniques (from subdural strips and grids to penetrating electrodes) that share the common attribute of recording neural activity from the human brain with high spatial and temporal resolution. While this ability has resulted in many high-impact advances in understanding fundamental mechanisms of brain function in health and disease, it generates staggering amounts of data as a single patient can be implanted with hundreds of electrodes, each sampled thousands of times a second for hours or even days. The difficulty of exploring these vast datasets is the rate-limiting step in using them to improve human health. We propose to overcome this obstacle by creating an easy-to-use, powerful platform designed from the ground up for the unique properties of ECOG. We dub this software tool RAVE (“R Analysis and Visualization of Electrocorticography data”).  The first goal of Aim 1 is to release RAVE 1.0 to the entire ECOG community by month 6 of the first funding period. This will maximize transformative impact by putting the new tools in the hands of users as quickly as possible, facilitating rapid adoption. The design philosophy of RAVE is driven by three imperatives. The first is to keep users ""close to the data"" so that users may make discoveries about the brain without being misled by artifacts. The second imperative is rigorous statistical methodology. The final imperative is ""play well with others"". As described in Aim 2, our approach will make it easy to seamlessly incorporate new and existing analysis tools written in Matlab, C++, Python or R into RAVE, giving users the best of both worlds: advanced but easy-to-use visualization of results from ECOG experiments, whether they are analyzed with the off-the- shelf tools routines provided with RAVE or novel tools developed by others. Project Narrative  A fast-growing technique in human neuroscience is electrocorticography (ECOG), the only technique that allow the activity of small population of neurons in the human brain to be directly recorded with high spatial and temporal resolution. ECOG generates staggering amounts of data, and the rate-limiting step in generating new insights about the human brain is the difficulty in exploring this vast quantity of data. We propose to remove this obstacle by creating an easy-to-use, powerful platform designed from the ground up for the analysis and visualization of ECOG data, known as RAVE (“R Analysis and Visualization of Electrocorticography data”).",RAVE: A New Open Software Tool for Analysis and Visualization of Electrocorticography Data,9933092,R24MH117529,"['Adoption ', ' Algorithms ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electrodes ', ' Implanted Electrodes ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human Activities ', ' Laboratories ', ' Language ', ' Least-Squares Analysis ', ' Least Squares ', ' Least-Squares Analyses ', ' Literature ', ' Medicine ', ' Methodology ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Nightmare ', ' Paper ', ' Patients ', ' Philosophy ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Rest ', ' Seeds ', ' Plant Embryos ', ' Plant Zygotes ', ' seed ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Design ', ' Designing computer software ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' statistics ', ' Time ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Pythons ', ' Ensure ', ' insight ', ' Funding ', ' Letters ', ' tool ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' programs ', ' electrocorticography ', ' Electrocorticogram ', ' Hour ', ' Techniques ', ' Visit ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' experience ', ' computer science ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' novel ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' Data ', ' Proliferating ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' interoperability ', ' Implant ', ' Plug-in ', ' wiki ', ' open source ', ' Graphical interface ', ' graphic user interface ', ' software user interface ', ' graphical user interface ', ' temporal resolution ', ' time measurement ', ' temporal measurement ', ' Amalgam ', ' application program interface ', ' application programming interface ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' Visualization ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' ']",NIMH,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R24,2020,236620,TX-09,0.0013746524575529429
"Personalized Deep Learning Models of Rapid Changes in Major Depressive Disorder Symptoms using Passive Sensor Data from Smartphones and Wearable Devices ABSTRACT Major depressive disorder (MDD) is highly prevalent and the leading cause of global disease burden. Associated with over 1,000 different symptom profiles, MDD is highly heterogeneous. The majority of MDD symptom change occurs across hours. Consequently, there is a need to increasingly focus MDD research on personalized assessment of these rapid symptom fluctuations. To date, personalized models of MDD have shown promise, but relied solely on self-report measures. There is thus a critical need to develop personalized models of MDD that incorporate objective signals. Passively collected information from smartphones and wearable sensors can continuously and unobtrusively track behavioral and physiological signals related to core disturbances associated with MDD, including psychomotor retardation, sleep disturbances, social contact, behavioral activation, heart rate variability, and screen time. Preliminary data suggest that personalized artificial intelligence (i.e., personally weighted deep learning models) are well suited for creating novel personalized digital biomarkers of these passive indicators, and that these biomarkers can predict rapid changes in MDD symptoms. This proposal will investigate the ability to develop personalized deep learning models of rapid changes in MDD symptoms among a nationally representative sample of 120 treatment seeking adults with MDD across 90 days using passively collected data from smartphones and wearable sensors. This proposal aims to test the accuracy of personalized, subtyped, and cohort-based modeling techniques and uncover personalized digital biomarkers of moment-to-moment changes in MDD symptoms. The project proposes the following innovations: it will (1) conduct the first passive-sensing study of MDD in a nationally-representative cohort; (2) utilize deep learning models to aid in the discovery of novel maintenance factors of MDD symptom changes; and (3) use personalized multimodal assessments of MDD to address the heterogeneity in MDD. In line with the aims of the NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC), this project will study MDD symptom changes across multiple units of analysis and integrate multiple systems. This study will provide a critical step towards uncovering novel personalized maintenance patterns of MDD symptom changes in daily life. Further, it will allow for scalable personalized treatments to be developed using technology to deliver behavioral interventions in the moments immediately preceding rapid MDD symptom changes. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project aims to utilize personalized artificial intelligence techniques and objective data (collected from smartphones and wearable devices) to create individualized digital biomarkers of rapid changes in major depressive disorder symptoms. This is important because, if we were to uncover personalized patterns between objectively measured physiology and behavioral changes and understand their resulting impact on rapid fluctuations in major depressive disorder symptoms, we would be able to define new, person-specific maintenance patterns that underlie the wide-ranging heterogeneity that is currently seen in patients suffering from major depressive disorder. Moreover, these advancements will provide a crucial step forward towards developing personalized, scalable, technology-based interventions that will be able to be delivered immediately (and, ideally, before rapid symptom changes) among those persons with major depressive disorder.",Personalized Deep Learning Models of Rapid Changes in Major Depressive Disorder Symptoms using Passive Sensor Data from Smartphones and Wearable Devices,10029386,R01MH123482,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Arousal ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Maintenance ', ' Moods ', ' Persons ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Patients ', ' Physiology ', ' Research ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Sleep ', ' Sleep disturbances ', ' aberrant sleep ', ' disrupted sleep ', ' disturbed sleep ', ' impaired sleep ', ' poor sleep ', ' sleep disruption ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Wrist ', ' Measures ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Light Reflection Rheography ', ' Photoreflexometries ', ' Photoreflexometry ', ' Photoplethysmography ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' prematurity ', ' premature ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' analog ', ' Exposure to ', ' depressed ', ' sadness ', ' Depressed mood ', ' Life ', ' Hour ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' meetings ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' treatment planning ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Devices ', ' social ', ' Deterioration ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' actigraph ', ' actigraphy ', ' clinical depression ', ' major depression ', ' major depression disorder ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Subgroup ', ' Collection ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' screen time ', ' television watching ', ' tv watching ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' digital ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' multi-modality ', ' multimodality ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' treatment response ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' heart rate variability ', ' RDoC ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' BigData ', ' Big Data ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized medicine ', ' Positive Valence ', ' Negative Valence ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' phenomenology ', ' phenomenological models ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' learning strategy ', ' biomarker-driven ', ' body sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' wearable sensor ', ' wearable system ', ' wireless sensor technology ', ' wearable sensor technology ', ' wearable electronics ', ' wearable technology ', ' wearable device ', ' deep learning ', ' microphone ', ' ']",NIMH,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2020,570435,NH-02,0.002652317826285473
"Continuous Non-Invasive Blood Pressure Monitor for Neonates Summary/Abstract Each year, about 5-18% of babies are born preterm, accounting for over 0.5M births in the US and 15M globally. Many of these babies are admitted to Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs) where the medical staff generally have the option of using either invasive arterial lines (IALs) or inflatable-cuff non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP) monitoring. The former introduces the risk of infection, tissue and nerve damage, and the latter is less accurate, especially for hypotensive infants, and may add the risk of ischemic and nerve damage upon repeated measurement. There is a clear need for a safer, continuous, and cost effective form of NIBP measurement to meet the challenge of managing unhealthy blood pressures for neonates. PyrAmes Inc. has developed a novel capacitive sensor technology that is paper thin and flexible and can accurately detect blood pressure (BP). This sensor technology is part of a unique continuous BP monitoring platform that provides accurate, lightweight and comfortable BP monitoring in a wireless, wrist-worn package that is easy to use. The system uses lightweight neural networks to analyze pulse waveform data to provide continuous determination of systolic, diastolic, and mean BP, heart rate, and their variabilities. The sensor is easy to apply non-invasively and records pulsatile data similar to an arterial line, while avoiding the difficulties of placing and maintaining an arterial line. This device can provide gold standard BP monitoring without perturbing the patients for more accurate and relevant measurements. The objective of this project is to extend the platform for use with term and pre-term neonates. This goal will be accomplished through redesign of the sensor hardware and optimization of the data analytics software. We will validate these modifications with clinical data from the NICU at Stanford University Medical Center. In Phase I, we will miniaturize the electronics and modify the sensor array of a wrist-worn pulse wave monitor to be sized more appropriately for neonates. We will validate the new device design by collecting NICU clinical data from patients who have IALs in place in an IRB-approved study. From IAL and sensor data taken simultaneously, we will determine ground truth values on a pulse-by-pulse basis and use these data in conjunction with additional IAL data from historical databases to improve our sensor quality and predictive BP models. Our success metric will be to equal or exceed the quality and accuracy of our data for adults. Phase II will be a follow-up IRB-approved pivotal study using the device from Phase 1 to position our device for FDA submission and clearance and scale up to pilot production of this device. Project Narrative The goal of this Phase 1 project is to confirm that machine learning can be used to extract blood pressure values for critically ill neonates from pulse waveform data collected with a wearable, non-invasive device that is comfortable, low-cost and easy to use. The proposed device will significantly reduce the need for frequent cuff-based measurements and/or invasive arterial lines, thereby decreasing morbidity, risk of complications, patient discomfort, and overall cost of care. This project is based on the pioneering efforts of Prof. Zhenan Bao’s lab at Stanford on thin film sensors for electronic skin and includes the design and use of a miniaturized device to collect clinical data from neonates that will be used to validate a model which derives blood pressure values from the pulse waveform without external calibration.",Continuous Non-Invasive Blood Pressure Monitor for Neonates,9910153,R43HD101175,"['Academic Medical Centers ', ' University Medical Centers ', ' Accounting ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Antihypertensive Agents ', ' Anti-Hypertensive Agents ', ' Anti-Hypertensive Drugs ', ' Anti-Hypertensives ', ' Antihypertensive Drugs ', ' Antihypertensives ', ' Hypotensive Agent ', ' Hypotensive Drugs ', ' Hypotensives ', ' Arterial Lines ', ' Intra-Arterial Lines ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Blood pressure determination ', ' Blood Pressure Monitors ', ' Continuous Sphygmomanometers ', ' Calibration ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Critical Illness ', ' Critically Ill ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Electromagnetics ', ' Electronics ', ' electronic device ', ' Limb structure ', ' Extremities ', ' Limbs ', ' Non-Trunk ', ' Female ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Bleeding ', ' blood loss ', ' Infant ', ' Neonatal Intensive Care Units ', ' Newborn Intensive Care Units ', ' neonatal ICU ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' male ', ' Medical Staff ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Nerve ', ' Noise ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Paper ', ' Patients ', ' Polychlorinated Biphenyls ', ' PCBs ', ' Polychlorobiphenyl Compounds ', ' polychlorobiphenyl ', ' pressure ', ' Production ', ' Reading ', ' Records ', ' Risk ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Thinness ', ' Leanness ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' tonometry ', ' Work ', ' Wrist ', ' Measures ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' Device Designs ', ' Film ', ' Light Reflection Rheography ', ' Photoreflexometries ', ' Photoreflexometry ', ' Photoplethysmography ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Surface ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Training ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Measurement ', ' lightweight ', ' light weight ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Pulse ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' System ', ' Coin ', ' success ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' miniaturize ', ' Pulse Pressure ', ' Skin ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Clinical Data ', ' computational analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computer analyses ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' wireless ', ' Wireless Technology ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' neonate ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' scale up ', ' Neonatal ', ' cost effective ', ' Consumption ', ' encryption ', ' demographics ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' IRB ', ' IRBs ', ' Institutional Review Boards ', ' Data Analytics ', ' premature neonates ', ' premature newborn ', ' preterm neonate ', ' preterm newborn ', ' Bluetooth ', ' sensing technology ', ' sensor technology ', ' care costs ', ' artificial neural net ', ' computational neural network ', ' synthetic neural network ', ' artificial neural network ', ' neural network ', ' infection risk ', ' ']",NICHD,"PYRAMES, INC.",R43,2020,224556,CA-17,0.02795331169928278
"CHABMAP (Cyanobacterial Harmful Algal Bloom Mapping and Analyses Platform) technology automates the quantification of toxic CyanoHABs exposure epochs for any waterbody. Specific Aim #1: Operationalize spatio-temporal CyanoHAB exposure epoch metrics  • Fuse multi-scale and disparate satellite remote sensing platforms and automate retrievals over  space and time to derive CyanoHAB exposure metrics.

"Anatomy Directly from Imagery: General-purpose, Scalable, and Open-source Machine Learning Approaches Project Summary The form (or shape) and function relationship of anatomical structures is a central theme in biology where abnor- mal shape changes are closely tied to pathological functions. Morphometrics has been an indispensable quan- titative tool in medical and biological sciences to study anatomical forms for more than 100 years. Recently, the increased availability of high-resolution in-vivo images of anatomy has led to the development of a new generation of morphometric approaches, called statistical shape modeling (SSM), that take advantage of modern computa- tional techniques to model anatomical shapes and their variability within populations with unprecedented detail. SSM stands to revolutionize morphometric analysis, but its widespread adoption is hindered by a number of sig- niﬁcant challenges, including the complexity of the approaches and their increased computational requirements, relative to traditional morphometrics. Arguably, however, the most important roadblock to more widespread adop- tion is the lack of user-friendly and scalable software tools for a variety of anatomical surfaces that can be readily incorporated into biomedical research labs. The goal of this proposal is thus to address these challenges in the context of a ﬂexible and general SSM approach termed particle-based shape modeling (PSM), which automat- ically constructs optimal statistical landmark-based shape models of ensembles of anatomical shapes without relying on any speciﬁc surface parameterization. The proposed research will provide an automated, general- purpose, and scalable computational solution for constructing shape models of general anatomy. In Aim 1, we will build computational and machine learning algorithms to model anatomies with complex surface topologies (e.g., surface openings and shared boundaries) and highly variable anatomical populations. In Aim 2, we will introduce an end-to-end machine learning approach to extract statistical shape representation directly from im- ages, requiring no parameter tuning, image pre-processing, or user assistance. In Aim 3, we will provide intuitive graphical user interfaces and visualization tools to incorporate user-deﬁned modeling preferences and promote the visual interpretation of shape models. We will also make use of recent advances in cloud computing to enable researchers with limited computational resources and/or large cohorts to build and execute custom SSM work- ﬂows using remote scalable computational resources. Algorithmic developments will be thoroughly evaluated and validated using existing, fully funded, large-scale, and constantly growing databases of CT and MRI images lo- cated on-site. Furthermore, we will develop and disseminate standard workﬂows and domain-speciﬁc use cases for complex anatomies to promote reproducibility. Efforts to develop the proposed technology are aligned with the mission of the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS), and its third strategic goal: to bridge biology and quantitative science for better global health through supporting the development of and access to computational research tools for biomedical research. Our long-term goal is to increase the clinical utility and widespread adoption of SSM, and the proposed research will establish the groundwork for achieving this goal. Project Narrative This project will develop general-purpose, scalable, and open-source statistical shape modeling (SSM) tools, which will present unique capabilities for automated anatomy modeling with less user input. The proposed tech- nology will introduce a number of signiﬁcant improvements to current SSM approaches and tools, including the support for challenging modeling problems, inferring shapes directly from images (and hence bypassing the seg- mentation step), parallel optimizations for speed, and new user interfaces that will be much easier and scalable than the current tools. The proposed technology will constitute an indispensable resource for the biomedical and clinical communities that will enable new avenues for biomedical research and clinical investigations, provide new ways to answer biologically related questions, allow new types of questions to be asked, and open the door for the integration of SSM with clinical care.","Anatomy Directly from Imagery: General-purpose, Scalable, and Open-source Machine Learning Approaches",9969467,R01AR076120,"['Adoption ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Biological Sciences ', ' Biologic Sciences ', ' Bioscience ', ' Life Sciences ', ' Biology ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cardiology ', ' Felis catus ', ' Cats ', ' Cats Mammals ', ' Domestic Cats ', ' Feline Species ', ' Felis domestica ', ' Felis domesticus ', ' Felis sylvestris catus ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Ice ', ' Laboratory Research ', ' Learning ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Mathematical Computing ', ' Math Computing ', ' Mathematic Computing ', ' Medicine ', ' Mission ', ' Anatomic Models ', ' Anatomical Models ', ' Modernization ', ' Morphogenesis ', ' morphogenetic process ', ' Occupations ', ' Jobs ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Online Systems ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' online computer ', ' web based ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Orthopedics ', ' Orthopedic ', ' Orthopedic Surgical Profession ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Science ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Engineering ', ' Computer Software Development ', ' Computer Software Engineering ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Supervision ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Specialist ', ' Custom ', ' Imagery ', ' injuries ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' biomedical resource ', ' image processing ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Surface ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' Intuition ', ' Visual ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Funding ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' particle ', ' cohort ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' Bypass ', ' Modeling ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' model development ', ' Address ', ' global health ', ' Biological Testing ', ' Data ', ' NIGMS ', ' National Institute of General Medical Sciences ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Resolution ', ' Anatomic Surface ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Collection ', ' Computational Technique ', ' Pathologic ', ' Modification ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' visualization tool ', ' Visualization software ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' imaging Segmentation ', ' computational resources ', ' computing resources ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' Image data archive ', ' image archive ', ' image library ', ' picture archive ', ' image archival system ', ' user-friendly ', ' open source ', ' Graphical interface ', ' graphic user interface ', ' software user interface ', ' graphical user interface ', ' usability ', ' clinical care ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' Cloud Infrastructure ', ' cloud computer ', ' Cloud Computing ', ' Geometry ', ' Complex Analysis ', ' imaging in vivo ', ' in vivo imaging ', ' clinical investigation ', ' deep learning ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' Computer Models ', ' algorithm development ', ' large data sets ', ' large datasets ', ' ']",NIAMS,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2020,614363,UT-02,0.003166599670387411
"Smartband/smartphone-based automatic smoking detection and real time mindfulness intervention PROJECT SUMMARY Smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in the US. Effective smoking cessation interventions are available but underutilized. Smoking cessation interventions delivered by smartphone apps are a promising tool for helping smokers quit. Delivery of treatments via smartphone apps may maximize the likelihood of use by smokers and the potential impact on smoking behavior. However, currently available smartphone apps for smoking cessation have not exploited their unique potential advantages to aid quitting. Notably, no available apps utilize wearable technologies; all current apps require users to self-report their smoking; and no apps deliver treatment automatically contingent upon smoking. Therefore, this pilot trial will test the feasibility of using a smartband to detect and track smoking and deliver brief smoking cessation interventions by smartphone app in real time. The interventions to be delivered will be brief mindfulness exercises that have been previously shown to reduce craving and smoking. This trial uses SmokeBeat, a novel mobile technology platform that uses multimodal data from wristband sensors to monitor and detect smoking, notify smokers about their smoking in real time and deliver real time interventions triggered by detected smoking episodes. SmokeBeat also applies machine learning to smoking tracking data to identify individual smoking patterns and deliver real time interventions targeted at predicted smoking episodes. This trial tests a three-step intervention to reduce smoking, in which smokers first become aware of their smoking and triggers by tracking smoking; then gain a clear recognition of the actual effects of smoking by “mindful smoking”; and finally learn to work mindfully with cravings rather than smoke. Briefly, daily smokers (N=200, ≥5 cig/day) will wear a smartband to detect and notify them of smoking for 21 days and obtain individual smoking profiles; detected smoking will then trigger a “mindful smoking” exercise for the next 7 days leading up to their quit date at 30 days; after which another mindfulness exercise (“RAIN”: recognize, accept, investigate and note cravings rather than smoke) will be delivered prior to each predicted smoking episode according to their individual smoking profile for 30 days post-quit. Aim 1 will be to determine treatment fidelity. Fidelity measures will be: (1) percent of smoking episodes correctly detected; (2) percent of “mindful smoking” exercises correctly triggered by smoking; and (3) users’ real time ratings of how timely “RAIN” was delivered to predicted smoking episodes. Aim 2 will be to determine adherence to treatment. Adherence measures will be: (1) percent of time spent wearing the smartband; (2) percent of smoking notifications answered; (3) percent of ecological momentary assessment (EMA) ratings (e.g., timeliness and others) answered; and (4) percent of mindfulness exercises completed. Aim 3 will be to determine the acceptability of treatment. Acceptability measures will be: (1) average helpfulness ratings after each mindfulness exercise; (2) feedback on user experience surveys. Overall: this project tests a highly innovative technology-based mindfulness intervention for smoking cessation.

"Optimizing BCI-FIT: Brain Computer Interface - Functional Implementation Toolkit SUMMARY  Many of the estimated four million adults in the U.S. with severe speech and physical impairments (SSPI) resulting from neurodevelopmental or neurodegenerative diseases cannot rely on current assistive technologies (AT) for communication. During a single day, or as their disease progresses, they may transition from one access technology to another due to fatigue, medications, changing physical status, or progressive motor dysfunction. There are currently no clinical or AT solutions that adapt to the multiple, dynamic access needs of these individuals, leaving many people poorly served. This competitive renewal, called BCI-FIT (Brain Computer Interface-Functional Implementation Toolkit) adds to our innovative multidisciplinary translational research conducted over the past 11 years for the advancement of science related to non-invasive BCIs for communication for these clinical populations. BCI-FIT relies on active inference and transfer learning to customize a completely adaptive intent estimation classifier to each user's multiple modality signals in real-time. The BCI-FIT acronym has many implications: our BCI fits to each user's brain signals; to the environment, offering relevant personal language; to the user's internal states, adjusting signals based on drowsiness, medications, physical and cognitive abilities; and to users' learning patterns from BCI introduction to expert use.  Three specific aims are proposed: (1) Develop and evaluate methods for optimizing system and user performance with on-line, robust adaptation of multi-modal signal models. (2) Develop and evaluate methods for efficient user intent inference through active querying. (3) Integrate language interaction and letter/word supplementation as input modalities in real-time BCI use. Four single case experimental research designs will evaluate both user performance and technology performance for functional communication with 35 participants with SSPI in the community, and 30 healthy controls for preliminary testing. The same dependent variables will be tested in all experiments: typing accuracy (correct character selections divided by total character selections), information transfer rate (ITR), typing speed (correct characters/minute), and user experience (UX) questionnaire responses about comfort, workload, and satisfaction. Our goal is to establish individualized recommendations for each user based on a combination of clinical and machine expertise. The clinical expertise plus user feedback added to active sensor fusion and reinforcement learning for intent inference will produce optimized multi-modal BCIs for each end-user that can adjust to short- and long-term fluctuating function. Our research is conducted by four sub-teams who have collaborated successfully to implement translational science: Electrical/computer engineering; Neurophysiology and systems science; Natural language processing; and Clinical rehabilitation. The project is grounded in solid machine learning approaches with models of participatory action research and AAC participation. This project will improve technologies and BCI technical capabilities, demonstrate BCI implementation paradigms and clinical guidelines for people with severe disabilities. PROJECT NARRATIVE The populations of US citizens with severe speech and physical impairments secondary to neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases are increasing as medical technologies advance and successfully support life. These individuals with limited to no movement could potentially contribute to their medical decision making, informed consent, and daily caregiving if they had faster, more reliable means that adapt to their best access methods in communication technologies, as proposed in BCI-FIT.

"Using Machine Learning to Develop Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions for Smoking Cessation PROJECT SUMMARY Mobile technology has enormous potential for delivering highly innovative, dynamic smoking cessation interventions. Phone sensors, wearable technology, and real time data collection methods such as ecological momentary assessment (EMA) have made it possible to collect a wealth of environmental and physiological data such as location, heart rate, and mood. Environmental and situational cues such as craving and proximity to others smoking are highly predictive of lapse among those trying to quit, suggesting that lapse risk is characterized by immediate, dynamic influences. Emerging strategies such as just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAI), aim to prevent smoking lapse using tailored support delivered via mobile technology in the moments when it is most needed. Although research has identified antecedents of smoking lapse based on observations from EMA data, studies have been unable to utilize the full spectrum of contextual and environmental data available with current technology. Given the importance of dynamic influences on lapse risk, there is a critical need for strategies that accurately identify moments of highest lapse risk to improve cessation interventions. Recent research has demonstrated the utility of machine learning to predict individual behavior. Machine learning is a robust data analytic strategy that can produce highly accurate predictive models from large datasets and can automatically adapt to new data in real time. The overall objective of this application is to use supervised machine learning methods to develop an automated algorithm to quantify smoking lapse risk at the individual level. Specifically, we aim: 1) to apply supervised machine learning methods to quantify personalized risk of smoking lapse, and 2) to evaluate the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of delivering a personalized, just-in-time adaptive intervention driven by machine learning prediction of smoking lapse risk in real time. The proposed research and training plan will take place at The University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center (OUHSC) and the Stephenson Cancer Center (SCC). Training will focus on increasing knowledge of machine learning methodology, and the conduct and analysis of JITAIs, which will facilitate completion of the proposed project. Results of the proposed research have the potential to reduce the amount and frequency of data needed from participants and sensors, enabling the development of less burdensome interventions. It is expected that completion of these aims will yield preliminary data to inform an automated, dynamic intervention that fully utilizes the strengths of mobile technology for measuring individual behavior and environmental context in real time. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will be among the first to use machine learning methods to predict risk of individual smoking lapse in real time. The resulting algorithm will provide a personalized model for each participant that adapts to new data and triggers the delivery of a tailored, precision intervention when it is most needed. If successful, this project and its methodology could be adapted to target other health behaviors such as diet, physical activity, or other substance use disorders.",Using Machine Learning to Develop Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions for Smoking Cessation,9883770,K99DA046564,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Behavior ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Control Groups ', ' Cues ', ' Data Collection ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Health behavior ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Moods ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Oklahoma ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Smoking ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Technology ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Wrist ', ' Measures ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Frequencies ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' craving ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Car Phone ', ' smoking cessation treatment ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Health Sciences ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Research Training ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Smoking Behavior ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' standard treatment ', ' standard care ', ' mobile app ', ' mobile application ', ' precision interventions ', ' personalized intervention ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' mobile platform ', ' mobile technology ', ' mobile computing ', ' Data Analytics ', ' accelerometry ', ' activity monitor ', ' activity tracker ', ' Accelerometer ', ' secondary analysis ', ' wearable electronics ', ' wearable technology ', ' wearable device ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' supervised learning ', ' adaptive intervention ', ' large data sets ', ' large datasets ', ' automatic algorithm ', ' automated algorithm ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA HLTH SCIENCES CTR,K99,2020,87670,OK-05,-0.0030825537127771923
"SenseWhy: Overeating in Obesity Through the Lens of Passive Sensing PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Medical professionals have recently put to rest the idea that there is an ideal weight loss diet for everyone. One cause for obesity is overeating, but we do not know what patterns and behaviors contribute to this problematic habit. Defining problematic eating behaviors that lead to energy imbalance is essential for treating obesity. Studies typically focus on a single putative causal mechanism of overeating such as stress or craving, not addressing the multiple features that co-occur with overeating. Hence, the factors that predict overeating episodes remain unknown, as do which of them contribute to an individual's consistency and variability of overeating. Given recent advancements in passive sensing, we now have the potential to detect problematic eating using seamlessly captured physiological features such as number of feeding gestures and swallows, and heart rate variability. Collecting detectable and predictable features that identify overeating will hone in on the patterns that interventionists may optimally target to help populations with obesity understand their eating habits and ultimately improve their ability to self-regulate their eating behaviors. Location-scale models will map the factors that most contribute to habit formation within subjects, providing interventionists with essential targets to guide behavior. The first aim is to collect sensor-based and ecological momentary assessment data (to assess factors not yet detectable through sensing) from adults with obesity and apply machine learning algorithms to identify a subset of features that detect overeating, as validated against ground truth of videotaped eating episodes and 24 hour dietary recall. Participants will wear a passive sensing sensor suite and respond to random and event-triggered prompts regarding each eating episode. Then, machine learning will determine the optimal feature subset that detect overeating episodes using Gradient Boosting Machines. In the second aim, hierarchical clustering techniques will cluster overeating episodes into theoretically meaningful and clinically known problematic behaviors related to overeating. The final aim is to build statistical models that explain the effect of detectable and clinically-known problematic features on new habit formation. These models will lay a foundation for optimization studies to discover evidence-based decision rules that can guide timely interventions to treat obesity by preventing overeating, and maintaining healthy eating behaviors. PROJECT NARRATIVE Obesity affects more than a third of American adults. Weight loss regimens rely on self-monitoring, but many people struggle to exercise this skill due to difficulty of execution and small perceived short-term benefit. Wearable passive sensors allow us to learn an individual's problematic eating behaviors more easily. Analyzing sensor data then enables us to identify the essential factors that describe and even predict overeating, and ultimately provide personalized care that supports maintenance of healthy eating behaviors.",SenseWhy: Overeating in Obesity Through the Lens of Passive Sensing,9829561,K25DK113242,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' EtOH use ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol use ', ' Algorithms ', ' Appetitive Behavior ', ' Searching Behavior ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavioral Medicine ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Energy Intake ', ' Caloric Intake ', ' caloric dietary content ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Computers ', ' Cues ', ' Deglutition ', ' Swallowing ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Exercise ', ' Family ', ' Feeding behaviors ', ' Ingestive Behavior ', ' feeding-related behaviors ', ' nutrient intake activity ', ' Foundations ', ' Gestures ', ' Goals ', ' Habits ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Hyperphagia ', ' Overeating ', ' polyphagia ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Maintenance ', ' Maps ', ' Mastication ', ' Chewing ', ' chewed ', ' chews ', ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Moods ', ' Neck ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulentia ', ' obese ', ' obese people ', ' obese person ', ' obese population ', ' Phenotype ', ' Public Health ', ' Records ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Rest ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Smoking ', ' Stress ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Videotape ', ' Body Weight decreased ', ' Weight Loss ', ' Weight Reduction ', ' body weight loss ', ' wt-loss ', ' Wrist ', ' Friends ', ' Measures ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Dietary Habits ', ' eating habit ', ' Diet Habits ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Medical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' participant recruitment ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Dietitian ', ' Scientist ', ' Hour ', ' Calories ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' computer science ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' social ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' craving ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Intake ', ' Monitor ', ' substance abuse therapy ', ' substance abuse treatment ', ' obesity treatment ', ' feeding ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Food Access ', ' Population ', ' Eating Behavior ', ' hedonic ', ' lenses ', ' lens ', ' evidence base ', ' heart rate variability ', ' emotional eater ', ' emotional eating ', ' Regimen ', ' algorithmic methods ', ' algorithmic methodologies ', ' Precision care ', ' individualized care ', ' individualized patient care ', ' personalized patient care ', ' personalized care ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' Data Analytics ', ' Healthy Eating ', ' body sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' wearable sensor ', ' wearable system ', ' wireless sensor technology ', ' wearable sensor technology ', ' wearable electronics ', ' wearable technology ', ' wearable device ', ' adult adiposity ', ' adults with obesity ', ' adult obesity ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' adaptive intervention ', ' machine learning method ', ' behavior phenotype ', ' behavioral phenotyping ', ' ']",NIDDK,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,K25,2020,165045,IL-07,-0.005777648266726285
"New Computational Methods for Data-driven Protein Structure Prediction Proteins play fundamental roles in all biological processes. Accurate description of protein structure is an important step towards understanding of biological life and highly relevant in the development of therapeutics and drugs. Although experimental structure determination has been greatly improved, there is still a very large gap between the number of available protein sequences and that of solved protein structures, which can only be filled by computational prediction. The long-term goal of this project is to apply machine learning and optimization algorithms to understand protein sequence-structure-function relationship by analyzing sequence, structure and functional data and to develop data-driven computational methods and tools for structure and functional prediction. We believe that by developing sophisticated algorithms to extract knowledge from the increasing sequence and structure data, we can model protein sequence-structure relationship very accurately and improve structure and functional prediction greatly. This project has already produced a few CASP-winning, widely-used data- driven algorithms and web servers (http://raptorx.uchicago.edu) for protein structure modeling. This renewal will further develop machine learning (especially deep learning) algorithms for protein structure modeling without good templates. The specific aims are: (1) developing deep learning (DL) algorithms for the prediction of protein contact and distance matrix; (2) developing distance-based algorithms for fast and accurate ab initio folding of proteins without templates; (3) developing DL algorithms for template-based modeling with only weakly similar templates. This renewal will lead to further understanding and new models of protein sequence-structure relationship and yield publicly available resources for automated, accurate, quantitative analysis for a wide range of proteins. The impact will be multiplied by tens of thousands of worldwide users employing our web servers to study a wide variety of proteins relevant to basic biological research and human diseases, in both low- and high-throughput experiments. Proteins and their interactions play fundamental roles in all biological processes including the maintenance of cellular integrity, metabolism, transcription/translation, and cell-cell communication.

"Dense life-log health analytics from wearable senors using functional analysis and Riemannian geometry The growth and acceptance of wearable devices (e.g., accelerometers) and personal technologies (e.g., smartphones), coupled with larger storage capacities, waterproofing, and more unobtrusive wear locations, has made long-term monitoring of behaviors throughout the 24-hour spectrum more feasible. Wearable devices relevant for human activity (e.g., GENEActiv accelerometer) contain several complementary sensors (accelerometers, gyro, heart- rate monitor etc.) and sample at high rates (e.g., 100Hz for accelerometer). These high-sampling rates and the long duration of capture result in life-log data that truly qualifies as multimodal and big time-series data. The challenges and opportunities involved in fully harvesting these types of data, for widely applicable interventions, suggest that an interdisciplinary approach spanning mathematical sciences, signal processing, and health is needed. Our innovation includes the use of functional-data analysis tools to represent and process the dense time-series data. Functional data analysis is then integrated into machine learning and pattern discovery algorithms for activity classification, prediction of attributes, and discovery of new activity classes. We anticipate that the proposed framework will lead to new insights about human activity and its impact on health outcomes. This interdisciplinary project builds on several research activities of the team. Our past work includes: a) new mathematical developments for computing statistics on time-series data viewed as elements of a function-spaces, b) algorithms for activity recognition that integrate the function-space techniques, and c) data from long-term observational studies of human activity from multimodal sensors. The new work we propose addresses the unique mathematical and computational challenges posed by densely multimodal, long-term, densely-sampled Iifelog big-data in a comprehensive framework. The fusion of ideas from human activity modeling, functional-analysis, geometric metrics, and algorithmic machine learning, present unique opportunities for fundamental advancement of the state-of-the-art in objective measurement and quantification of behavioral markers from wearable devices. The proposed approach also brings to fore: a) new mathematical developments of elastic metrics over multi-modal time-series data, b) comparing sequences evolving on different feature manifolds, c) estimation of quasi- periodicities, d) and a new generation of machine-learning and pattern discovery algorithms. The mathematical and algorithmic tools proposed have the potential to significantly advance how wearable data from contemporary devices with high-sampling rates and large storage capabilities are represented, processed, and transformed into accurate inferences about human activity. Wearable devices are becoming more widely adopted in recent years for general health and recreational uses by the broad populace.

"Wireless withdrawal detection and monitoring system for neonatal abstinence syndrome. SPECIFIC AIMS Neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) is an opioid withdrawal syndrome that develops shortly after birth to in utero-exposed neonates. The cost of NAS is high: newborns with NAS are typically receive care in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), where the daily cost of care is high. Nearly 22,000 infants are born with NAS each year at a cost of $1.5 billion. Moreover, medication-based interventions for the treatment of NAS, used in up to 80% of opioid-exposed infants, carry their own risks of toxicity and drug interactions. Despite the medical cost, high societal impact of NAS, and the risks of treatment, the tools to assess the severity of NAS can be subjective and suffer from examiner bias. There is an urgent need for innovative new methods to diagnose NAS and assess the efficacy of responses to treatment. Flexible, low-cost wearable devices (worn on the skin) that can report measures of systemic biochemical and biomechanical processes offer a simple and economical solution. In NAS, surges of sympathetic nervous system activity produce increased heart rate, skin conductance, unstable temperature, and tremor. These manifest in increased infant sweating, seizures, tremors, unstable body temperature, and more—events that must continually monitored and assessed by nurses. The unsupervised, objective detection/quantification of the bodily response of neonates suffering from NAS could drive the development of new, objective scoring tools that can guide the initiation, intensity, and duration of therapies for NAS. Such tools could significantly reduce medical costs and improve patient outcomes by reducing patient time in NICU, reducing nurse load, improving outpatient monitoring, and helping to assist in the optimization of patient treatments. Critically, we believe such a tool may be able to objectively capture events that may go unnoticed by nurses or while the infant is sleeping (minor tremors, poor oxygenation, temperature fluctuations, dehydration). This proposal seeks to develop interlinked, infant-targeted wearable biosensor-systems capable of continuously monitoring the biochemical to biophysical parameters of opioid-dependent neonates under treatment for NAS. Our team has outstanding experience in all areas necessary to this investigation. Our business unit has extensive NIH funded experience in wearable biosensing, in the detection of sympathetic nervous system activity in opioid withdrawal, pediatrics, business development, and intellectual property. Our academic partners have broad experience in novel biosensor development. PROJECT NARRATIVE Rekovar is developing a low cost wearable device that integrates wirelessly with a mobile device to allow real- time monitoring of the baby’s physical and physiological state and its ability to sleep, eat, and be nurtured while undergoing neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). This device has significant impact in helping reduce both hospital stay and costs as neonates receiving pharmacological treatment are usually in the NICU away from family and non-pharmacological care. Our interest lies with respect to proper neonatal care, where separate procedures occur for essential neonatal needs and needs for neonates undergoing withdrawal, and by using this monitoring device to assess addicted neonates undergoing withdrawal, caregivers are provided the better ability of treating the right neonatal needs with the appropriate procedure in hospitals.",Wireless withdrawal

"Wearable Sensors for Biofeedback & Remote Monitoring Rotator cuff tears are a common condition affecting approximately 25% of the population older than 60 years, and rotator cuff repair is a standard surgical procedure with nearly 500,000 procedures performed annually. In the United States alone the direct costs are over $7 billion per year. There is a relatively high rate of retears: ranging from 10% to 78%. Healing of the repair cuff is a protracted process during which the repaired tendon has to be unloaded by carefully restricting active muscle contraction. There is an inherent conflict in immobilizing the shoulder to protect the repair and mobilizing the shoulder to prevent stiffness. Teaching the patient passive exercises that do not activate contraction of the supraspinatus muscle is challenging and very difficult to monitor. To address this unmet need, we have developed a wearable sensor that provides direct real-time continuous biofeedback of muscle activity, joint angle, skin temperature, and swelling to enable passive shoulder exercises while minimizing muscle contraction. To test and validate this device we propose to the following Specific Aims. Aim 1: Design, manufacture, and test a wearable device with surface EMG (sEMG), inertial measurement unit (IMU), temperature, and bioimpedance sensors. Aim 2: Measure accuracy of Active4D sEMG and IMUs relative to standard clinical measurements. Active4D is a surgeon-driven company devoted to enhancing patient recovery from surgery by leveraging new technology. Active4D’s unique wearable sensor provides continuous long-term sensor augmented biofeedback to patients and enables remote patient monitoring for surgeons. The device measures seven physiologic metrics in real time – muscle activation, joint range of motion, skin temperature, swelling, activity, gait, and fall risk. Real time physiologic data will increase safety, improve outcomes, and enhance patient experience while lowering the cost of rehabilitation and complications. Unique artificial intelligence driven algorithms can decrease complications through predictive analytics which enable early detection and intervention for high risk patients.  The specific innovation to the application of rotator cuff repair, is the instantaneous feedback of muscle activity and motion which can accelerate recovery while reducing the risk of retears. At the successful completion of Phase I, we plan to launch a clinical trial comparing the outcomes of rotator cuff repair in patients guided by the A4D device in comparison to the current standard of postoperative rehabilitation.  Active4D is a small business with the objective of developing smart wearables, which integrate multiple biological and environmental sensors, wireless communication, computer models, and data analysis for providing feedback and remote monitoring, to enhance surgical rehabilitation and improved patient outcomes in orthopaedics. Co-founders Drs. Hoenecke and D’Lima have extensive experience in shoulder surgery and rehabilitation, multi-center clinical trials, and biomechanics research; and have successfully executed challenging projects such as implantation of innovative electronic knee designs and development of new shoulder implants. Dr. Hoenecke has over 30 years of experience in the practice of sports medicine with an emphasis on shoulder repair and reconstruction. He provides care for elite athletes and is design surgeon for two shoulder implants. Active4D has partnered with expert physical therapists and orthopedists to develop and test our innovative technology. Rotator cuff tears are a common condition affecting approximately 25% of the population older than 60 years. Despite the popularity of surgical repair, the rate of retears is high: ranging from 10% to 78%. Healing of the repair cuff is a lengthy process during which the repaired tendon has to be unloading by carefully restricting active muscle contraction. This Phase I SBIR will develop an innovative wearable device with the potential to facilitate safe exercises, alert the patient during activities at risk for retears, and accelerate recovery while reducing the risk for retears. The device can also remotely monitor progress of the patient over the postoperative period and can modulate the feedback appropriate to the phase of recovery.",Wearable Sensors for Biofeedback & Remote Monitoring,10156598,R43AR078082,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Biofeedback ', ' Biomechanics ', ' biomechanical ', ' Biophysics ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Complication ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Exercise ', ' Feedback ', ' Gait ', ' Health ', ' Immobilization ', ' orthopedic freezing ', ' Industry ', ' Infection ', ' Joints ', ' Knee ', ' Laboratories ', ' Mission ', ' Motion ', ' Muscle Contraction ', ' Muscle Cell Contraction ', ' Muscular Contraction ', ' Muscle ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' muscular ', ' Orthopedics ', ' Orthopedic ', ' Orthopedic Surgical Profession ', ' Legal patent ', ' Patents ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Patients ', ' Postoperative Period ', ' Post-Operative ', ' Postoperative ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' rehab therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' rehabilitative therapy ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Science ', ' Seeds ', ' Plant Embryos ', ' Plant Zygotes ', ' seed ', ' Shoulder ', ' Skin Temperature ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Sports Medicine ', ' Swelling ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Temperature ', ' Tendon structure ', ' Tendons ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Measures ', ' Articular Range of Motion ', ' Joint Range of Motion ', ' range of motion ', ' Rotator Cuff ', ' Businesses ', ' Caring ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Surface ', ' Clinical ', ' repair ', ' repaired ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Series ', ' Recovery ', ' Measurement ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Funding ', ' Letters ', ' System ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' interest ', ' Surgeon ', ' Supraspinatus ', ' supraspinatus muscle ', ' innovative technologies ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Devices ', ' miniaturize ', ' fall risk ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Direct Costs ', ' Multi-center clinical trial ', ' Multi-site clinical trial ', ' Multicenter clinical trial ', ' Multisite clinical trial ', ' Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Older Population ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cost ', ' healing ', ' reconstruction ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Implant ', ' implantation ', ' trial comparing ', ' prototype ', ' high risk ', ' Predictive Analytics ', ' Data Analytics ', ' rotator cuff tear ', ' improved outcome ', ' physiotherapist ', ' physical therapist ', ' post-operative rehab ', ' postoperative rehab ', ' postoperative rehabilitation ', ' post-operative rehabilitation ', ' body sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' wearable sensor ', ' wearable system ', ' wireless sensor technology ', ' wearable sensor technology ', ' wearable electronics ', ' wearable technology ', ' wearable device ', ' wireless communication ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' Computer Models ', ' ']",NIAMS,"ACTIVE4D, INC.",R43,2020,250998,CA-49,0.0002797655998506903
"GenePattern and GenePattern Notebook: Integrative 'Omic Analysis for Cancer Research Project Summary Over the past two decades, the landscape of cancer research has changed with the explosion of publicly available and investigator generated datasets from evolving technology platforms, and the growing number of sophisticated computational methods and tools to integrate and analyze them.

"Wireless ultrasonic powering and monitoring of Left Ventricular Assist Devices through the Internet of Medical Things Project Summary The objective of this project is to demonstrate feasibility of a novel platform technology using ultrasonic waves for wireless powering and bidirectional real-time communication of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD). Heart failure (HF) has become a challenge of epidemic proportions to the healthcare system in the United States with poor prognosis for patients and elevated healthcare costs. LVADs are standard surgical therapy for advanced HF patients refractory to medical management. Despite extensive training and daily care, LVAD recipients still experience driveline infections (14-28%) at an annual cost of $20,000 and represents a clinically- significant adverse event and one of the primary causes of death. Transcutaneous energy transmission systems (TETS) are being developed to eliminate the LVAD’s driveline. Currently, TETS technology is limited by (1) low energy transfer efficiency, (2) power loss due to coil misalignment, (3) reduced data transmission rates with increasing depth of penetration, and (4) heating of tissue. Bionet Sonar’s software-defined ultrasonic wide band (UsWB) proprietary technology is capable of transmitting energy and data via ultrasonic waves through tissue, bone, and fluids at penetration depths significantly greater than RF waves and with greater reliability. Since increasing energy efficiency results in reduced energy storage requirements UsWB also enables reduction in size of implantable technologies. Bionet’s UsWB TETS (UTET) system includes: (1) energy transfer portal with internal and external intelligent piezo array-surfaces, (2) implantable controller with energy storage capacity, (3) external controller with IoMT portal, and (4) wearable power supply. These elements will enable wireless LVAD operation over wide range of clinical conditions with real-time data acquisition and diagnostics. Proof-of-concept for Bionet’s core technology was tested in vitro, demonstrating superior data transmission compared to RF (700kHz, 180kbit/s, 20cm tissue depth) and ultrasonic wireless recharging. In this Phase I study, feasibility of the fully-integrated wireless, UTET system for LVAD support will be demonstrated by completing the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1: Design and fabricate fully-integrated UTET system and demonstrate feasibility with clinical- grade LVAD in an in vitro model that mimics clinically-relevant implantable tissue depths and geometries. Specific Aim 2: Demonstrate feasibility of the fully-integrated UTET system with clinical-grade LVAD in an acute bovine model (n=2) at flow rates of 1-5 L/min for up to 8 hours. This proposal leverages the strengths of Bionet and the Cardiovascular Innovation Institute. Our long-term goal is to successfully translate the Bionet’s UTET system into clinical practice. The core platform technology may also be applied to other networked systems for the treatment of diverse etiologies opening a new frontier in multimodal patient treatment and use of Artificial Intelligence for patient care. Project Narrative Through this proposal a novel platform technology using ultrasonic waves for wireless powering and bidirectional real-time communication of a ventricular assist device will be developed. Ultrasound wideband technology will be used to create a system that doesn’t require a trans-cutaneous driveline to control and energize the pump of a ventricular assist device, thus, eliminating drive-line infections and improving quality of life of heart failure patients. This technology will not only improve patient outcomes and healthcare economics of this patient population, but may also enable other innovative therapies in other populations.",Wireless ultrasonic powering and monitoring of Left Ventricular Assist Devices through the Internet of Medical Things,10007683,R43HL152767,"['Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Award ', ' bone ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Cattle ', ' Bovine Species ', ' bovid ', ' bovine ', ' cow ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Charge ', ' Communication ', ' Elements ', ' Energy Transfer ', ' Engineering ', ' Epidemic ', ' Family ', ' Fatigue ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Freezing ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heating ', ' Infection ', ' Institutes ', ' Intelligence ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Legal patent ', ' Patents ', ' Patients ', ' Power Sources ', ' Power Supplies ', ' pressure ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prognosis ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' Ultrasonography ', ' Echography ', ' Echotomography ', ' Medical Ultrasound ', ' Ultrasonic Imaging ', ' Ultrasonogram ', ' Ultrasound Diagnosis ', ' Ultrasound Medical Imaging ', ' Ultrasound Test ', ' diagnostic ultrasound ', ' sonogram ', ' sonography ', ' sound measurement ', ' ultrasound ', ' ultrasound imaging ', ' ultrasound scanning ', ' United States ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Caring ', ' Pump ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Surface ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Refractory ', ' Penetration ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' sonar ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Internet ', ' fluid ', ' liquid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' Supersonic waves ', ' Ultrasound waves ', ' Ultrasonic wave ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Hour ', ' subcutaneous ', ' System ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' novel ', ' healthcare economics ', ' health care economics ', ' Modeling ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' Skin ', ' Innovative Therapy ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Artificial Heart Ventricle ', ' Artificial Ventricles ', ' Ventricle-Assist Device ', ' ventricular assist device ', ' Ultrasonic ', ' Ultrasonics ', ' Data ', ' pre-clinical testing ', ' Preclinical Testing ', ' in vitro Model ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' wireless ', ' Wireless Technology ', ' Monitor ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' pathogen ', ' Population ', ' frontier ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' data acquisition ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinically significant ', ' Implant ', ' multi-modality ', ' multimodality ', ' patient population ', ' in vitro testing ', ' product development ', ' clinical practice ', ' data transfer ', ' data transmission ', ' data exchange ', ' verification and validation ', ' Phase I Study ', ' phase 1 study ', ' phase II study ', ' phase 2 study ', ' operation ', ' Geometry ', ' radiofrequency ', ' radio frequency ', ' LVAD ', ' left ventricular assist device ', ' Bluetooth ', ' wireless communication ', ' ']",NHLBI,BIONET SONAR,R43,2020,468992,MA-04,-0.025264888972246987
"Socioeconomic status, stress, and smoking cessation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The prevalence of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) is rising dramatically among both adults and youth and ENDS use is fast becoming a major public health issue. However, because of their recent emergence, researchers know little about ENDS, their use, their effects on human physiology and health, their risks and benefits, or their impact on tobacco control efforts. A common barrier to studying ENDS is the lack of data on objective, real world use of ENDS. Thus, the proposed project aims to adapt existing innovative mobile assessment tools that can be used to target critical ENDS research gaps by providing mobile sensing technology that can objectively collect precise data regarding ENDS use in real time in real world. Specifically, the proposed revision project will expand the scope of Project On Track (1R01CA190329-01A1, PI: Wetter) by extending the application of puffMarker, an existing tool that automatically detects smoking, for the assessment of ENDS use. The current project has three aims: 1) adapt and validate puffMarker to identify discrete episodes of ENDS use, 2) adapt and validate puffMarker to distinguish between cigarette smoking and ENDS use among dual users of ENDS and cigarettes, and 3) utilize the Project On Track protocol to collect real time, real world data investigating potential determinants of ENDS use among both exclusive ENDS users as well as dual users of cigarettes and ENDS. Altogether, 120 participants (30 for Aim 1, 30 for Aim 2, and 60 for Aim 3) will be enrolled. Participants recruited for Aims 1 and 2 will attend laboratory (three 2-hour sessions) and field (3 days) studies. In the laboratory sessions, participants will wear the AutoSense wireless sensors and be asked to use ENDS (Aim 1) or use ENDS and smoke a cigarette (Aim 2). Participants' ENDS and cigarette puffs will be recorded by an independent observer. In the field studies, participants will wear the AutoSense wireless sensors and be asked to use ENDS (Aim 1) or use ENDS and smoke cigarettes (Aim 2). Participants will be asked to record each instance of ENDS use or cigarette smoking on a SP. The goals of the laboratory studies are to collect data to train puffMarker to identify ENDS use and to distinguish between cigarette smoking and ENDS use. The goal of the field studies is to validate puffMarker in real-life, natural environments. Aim 3 will utilize the Project On Track protocol to collect the first real time, real world data on ENDS and dual use. Participants will be assessed for 6 days using AutoSense, EMA, and GPS to examine potential determinants of ENDS use.

"A Federated Galaxy for user-friendly large-scale cancer genomics research Project Summary Cancer research is now a data-driven discipline, but only a minority of cancer researchers are data scientists. This severely restricts our ability to effectively study and cure the disease. The far reaching significance of our project is in federating disparate data and computational resources in order to provide a unifying analysis platform for computational cancer research.  We will extend the popular scientific workbench Galaxy (https://galaxyproject.org) so that it can integrate with distributed data and compute resources used and needed by cancer researchers, including those resources in the NCI Cancer Research Data Commons (NCR DC). Our Federated Galaxy system will allow users to seamlessly access NCR DC data across multiple resources. It will support multiple analysis scenarios tuned to skills and computational requirements of individual researchers.  The aims of this project are: Aim 1. Extend Galaxy for working with distributed cancer genomics and phenotypic data. This will enable Galaxy users to access both public and private cancer data regardless of their actual physical location. Best-practice approaches will be used for accessing restricted datasets.  Aim 2. Enhance Galaxy for context-aware, distributed cancer genomics analyses using shared workflow representations. This will enable Galaxy users to run genomics analyses on different clouds, ultimately reducing the time, cost, and data transfer associated with analyses.  Aim 3. Apply Federated Galaxy to precision oncology research. Workflows developed in this aim will leverage the technologies in Aims 1 and 2 to benchmark machine learning algorithms for predicting tumor phenotype and drug response. Interactive reports will summarize benchmarking results and utilize ITCR visualizations for deep dives into results.  Our system will provide a singular access point to distributed cancer datasets and will enable these data to be analyzed within a single portal in a way that satisfies multiple analysis scenarios and utilizes diverse computational resources. Finally, a cloud-centric Galaxy built for the NCR DC will substantially grow the community of users working with the GDC and the NCR DC. This is because Galaxy brings with itself a vibrant world-wide community of users and developers, which numbers tens of thousands of scientists. These individuals will help to tune the GDC and other resources within the NCR DC to the needs of real-life analysis scenarios and will enrich the set of tools accessible to cancer researchers. Project Narrative This project will develop a user-friendly scientific analysis workbench for analyzing cancer genomics data on the NCI Cancer Research Data Commons cloud platform. The workbench will democratize access to cloud-based cancer genomic analyses.

"The Human Body Atlas: High-Resolution, Functional Mapping of Voxel, Vector and Meta Datasets Project Summary/Abstract The ultimate goal of the HIVE MC-IU effort is to develop a common coordinate framework (CCF) for the healthy human body that supports the cataloguing, exploration, and download of different types of tissue and individual cell data. The CCF will use different visual interfaces in order to exploit human and machine intelligence to improve data exploration and communication. The proposed effort combines decades of expertise in data and network visualization, scientific visualization, biology, and biomedical data standards. The goal is to develop a highly accurate and extensible multidimensional spatial basemap of the human body with associated data overlays. This basemap will be designed for online exploration as an atlas of tissue maps composed of diverse cell types, developed in close collaboration with the HIVE MC-NYGC team. To implement this functionality, we will develop methods to map and connect metadata, pixel/voxel data, and extracted vector data, allowing users to “navigate” across multiple levels (whole body, organ, tissue, cells). MC-IU will work in close collaboration with the HIVE Infrastructure and Engagement Component (IEC) and tools components (TCs) to connect and integrate further computational, analytical, visualization, and biometric resources driven by spatial context.

"Novel Wearable and Wireless Scratch Sensor as a Drug Discovery Tool Itch leads to serious impairment of quality of life—often times on par with pain. Itch is the hallmark symptom and primary driver of morbidity for atopic dermatitis (AD)—one of the most common inflammatory skin diseases affecting 24 million adults and 10 million children in the U.S. Currently, there is a severe lack of objective measurement of itch. Psychometric surveys are point measurements that lack sensitivity and validity—particularly in children. Measuring itch-related scratching behavior offers a potential objective way to measure itch. Unfortunately, wrist strapped electronics fail to capture scratch accurately and are not adapted for children. This project seeks to accelerate the full qualification of a novel, wearable sensor leveraging a machine learning algorithm to objectively and accurately measure scratching. We propose to address key comments from the FDA in our accepted letter of intent (DDT COA #000120) by accomplishing the following specific aims. Aim 1: we will augment our current scratch sensor to achieve 7-day battery life on a single wireless charge (current battery life: 24 hours) to increase adherence and reduce user burden. Aim 2: we propose to extend healthy normal testing to strengthen our predictive algorithm and train against additional cofounders with an additional 8 subjects (n=16 total). In addition, we will improve the usability and cybersecurity of our software and cloud system. Aim 3: we will extend our existing clinical study at Northwestern University to include more pediatric and adult individuals with AD (n=30 target total). Psychometric surveys will assess user/caregiver experience afterwards, and determine which features of the sensor have greatest value to patients. Success will be defined by successful submission of a full qualification plan to the FDA within 12 months as a fully accepted drug discovery tool. The long- term goal is to make this scratch sensor widely available to support drug development by providing an objective endpoint for itch, and inform future clinical care of treatment response in a patient’s naturalistic environment. Further applications include deployment in other itchy conditions (e.g. prurigo nodularis, chronic pruritus of the elderly, pruritus associated with renal or hepatic failure). Itch is a profoundly disturbing symptom that greatly reduces quality of life. For Atopic dermatitis (eczema) sufferers, a disease that afflicts 10% of children and 4% of adults in the U.S., itch is the greatest source of morbidity. However, there remains a lack of objective, repeatable measurement tools for itch hindering drug development. Measuring scratch behavior offers one opportunity to quantify itch. This project will support efforts to fully qualify an accepted letter of intent for a novel wearable scratch sensor as a drug development tool (COA# 0001120).",Novel Wearable and Wireless Scratch Sensor as a Drug Discovery Tool,10146184,U01FD007001,[''],FDA,"SONICA, LLC",U01,2020,249103,IL-09,-0.03202962993778516
"An Interoperable HL7 FHIR-based Medical Device Data System (MDDS) For Accessing And Integrating Live Point-Of-Care Data From High-Acuity Bedside Patient Monitoring Equipment Abstract The overall goal of this proposal is to combine expertise and approaches from biomedical engineering and critical care medicine to design a universal system to acquire, record and transmit physiological signals from bedside monitored patients. Patient monitors generate over a million datapoints of information per hour, however, only a tiny fraction of those data are transmitted or recorded. In order to improve data exchange in healthcare, the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard was published in 2014. However, it has yet to make a significant impact on Medical Device Integration (MDI), which is the process of automating the flow of clinical data from bedside medical devices, such as patient monitors, to external systems such as Electronic Medical Records (EMR). Also, MDI is a complex task because data from these devices are high-frequency and high- volume and because most devices use proprietary protocols and outdated interfaces such as serial cables. Hospitals and researchers have therefore been left with few options except to use expensive and vendor-specific MDI solutions to access these data or to use manual data entry into the patient EMR, which leads to data entry errors, late entry of data, and lost time for clinical care. Manual data entry only captures a tiny fraction of the available data, and with increased research interest in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning, there is a growing need for a standardized way to access the vast amounts of data from bedside devices. This project will develop a vendor-neutral software-based Medical Device Data System (MDDS) that acquires and records data from bedside devices across a hospital network and makes live data available to 3rd party systems using a FHIR application programming interface (API). The proposed proof-of-concept will consist of three elements: [i] a transmitter which encrypts and transmits patient signals across the network, [ii] an aggregator which receives, translates and records the signals to a central location, and [iii] a FHIR Server with API for allowing external systems to access live data as FHIR resources. This proposal seeks to create a novel design that will overcome a critical barrier in healthcare, medicine and research. The proposed MDDS will be valuable to hospitals, clinicians, researchers and app developers because it makes data accessible which were previously only available to clinicians at the bedside in real-time. Narrative MediCollector’s proposed vendor-neutral medical device data system (MDDS) will be a valuable research tool to access, acquire and record high-frequency bedside patient monitor data for facilitating clinical research in hospitals. In addition, it will make live patient monitor data accessible to external systems through an HL7 FHIR application programming interface (API), thereby improving interoperability in hospitals and opening the doors to the integration of live data into external systems, such as smartphone apps and artificial intelligence algorithms, which can improve clinical workflow and healthcare in general.",An Interoperable HL7 FHIR-based Medical Device Data System (MDDS) For Accessing And Integrating Live Point-Of-Care Data From High-Acuity Bedside Patient Monitoring Equipment,10140938,R43EB030890,"['Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Beds ', ' Biomedical Engineering ', ' bio-engineered ', ' bio-engineers ', ' bioengineering ', ' Boston ', ' Client ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Critical Care ', ' Data Display ', ' Elements ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Equipment ', ' Goals ', ' Hospitals ', ' Pediatric Hospitals ', "" Children's Hospital "", ' Information Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' Manuals ', ' Medical Device ', ' Medicine ', ' Patient Monitoring ', ' Patients ', "" Patients' Rooms "", ' Problem Solving ', ' Publishing ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Safety ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Vendor ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Ventilator ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Medical ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Hour ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Test Result ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Documentation ', ' Manufacturer ', ' Manufacturer Name ', ' Data ', ' Sum ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' point of care ', ' Instruction ', ' software systems ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' interoperability ', ' Graphical interface ', ' graphic user interface ', ' software user interface ', ' graphical user interface ', ' encryption ', ' clinical care ', ' data transfer ', ' data transmission ', ' data exchange ', ' Secure ', ' application program interface ', ' application programming interface ', ' data access ', ' Android App ', ' Android Application ', ' Cell Phone Application ', ' Cell phone App ', ' Cellular Phone App ', ' Cellular Phone Application ', ' Smart Phone App ', ' Smart Phone Application ', ' Smartphone App ', ' iOS app ', ' iOS application ', ' iPhone App ', ' iPhone Application ', ' smartphone Application ', ' FHIR ', ' Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources ', ' smart algorithm ', ' intelligent algorithm ', ' ']",NIBIB,"MEDICOLLECTOR, LLC",R43,2020,210642,MA-05,0.020366654090691896
"Clinical Evaluation of Burns using Spatial Frequency Domain Imaging Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Durkin, Anthony J. Abstract The central aim of this 3 year competing R01 renewal is to characterize and apply a new, compact, clinic- friendly Spatial Frequency Domain Imaging (SFDI) device to objectively and non-invasively classify burn severity (burn grade) over a large areas of skin. Delays in determining burn severity directly impacts patient treatment plans (including decisions whether to graft), rates of infection and scarring, duration of hospitalization and ultimately cost of care. Currently, the primary method of determining burn severity continues to be clinical assessment, which is highly subjective. While both superficial thickness and full-thickness burns are typically readily diagnosed based on visual clinical impression, partial thickness burns are difficult to classify and carry with them considerable potential for complications. Burn severity classification accuracy, even by experts, is only 60–80%. Our research in animal models demonstrates that SFDI data can successfully be used to classify different regions of burn severities. Typically, these differences are not apparent to the unaided eye and a great deal of training and experience is required in order for clinicians to accurately differentiate them Our work using a research grade, hybrid-SFDI device suggests that objective parameters provided by SFDI can be used within 24 hours after injury, to accurately classify burn severity. Specifically, we have demonstrated in a porcine burn model that the research grade SFDI outperforms laser speckle imaging and thermal imaging at 24 hours post-burn, in terms of predicting whether a burn will require a graft or not. However, translating these results to the clinic has been difficult due to several device limitations. The research grade SFDI device has slow acquisition times that can result in motion artifacts. It is also sensitive to ambient light which is often an issue in a clinical setting. Additionally, the SFDI device generates so much diverse data (oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin, water fraction, reduced scattering coefficients at multiple wavelengths), there is no obvious way to present it to a clinical user to make a quick decision. To this end, we propose to methodically investigate an improved next generation SFDI device that addresses these issues by using brighter LEDs and fewer wavelengths to rapidly collect data in a way that reduces motion artifacts and is independent of clinical lighting conditions. In addition, we will develop a machine learning based classification framework that will provide the clinical with actionalble diagnostic information. The central aim of this 3 year competing R01 renewal is to characterize and then modify a new clinic-friendly SFDI device (Clarifi) to objectively classify in- vivo regions of different burn severity over large areas. The proposed research seeks to investigate this via the following Specific Aims: 1) Test & Validate Clinical SFDI Instrument, 2) Compare Clinical SFDI Instrument to other Modalities on a Long Term Swine Model of Graded Burns, 3) Develop Spatially Resolved Classification Maps of Burn Severity based on SFDI Data, 4) Conduct Clinical Measurements of Burn Severity using the new SFDI device and Spatially Resolved Burn Severity Classification Maps based on SFDI data. Program Director (Last, first, middle): Durkin, Anthony J. PROJECT NARRATIVE Burn injuries rank in the top 15 causes of global burden of disease. Burn severity assessment, which is a critical step in treatment planning, is subjective, depending on the experience of the treating physician. This leads to misdiagnosis and increased days of hospitalization and cost. In order to address this, we propose to test, validate and apply a novel optical imaging device in order to provide noninvasive objective assessment of burn wound severity.

"Implantable Neurostimulators for Control of Oscillatory Brain Networks We propose to develop an implantable brain stimulation system to measure and control oscillatory local field potential (LFP) synchrony within brain networks. Implantable neurotechnologies like deep brain stimulation (DBS) have revolutionized the treatment of movement disorders and epilepsy. DBS has some clinical signal in psychiatry as well, but individual trial results are highly variable. We have argued that this is a target engagement problem – that the high-frequency constant stimulation used in Parkinson’s or other tremor disorders is not the right approach to the circuits of mental illness. Instead, we believe the correct approach is to identify signatures of healthy communication in these circuits/networks, then design stimulation protocols that specifically produce those signatures. LFP synchrony is likely one of those communication signatures. Across multiple domains of cognitive and emotional function, behavioral performance (a read-out of successful network communication) improves when brain regions show synchronous (coherent) LFP oscillations. Further, clinically effective DBS, in movement and psychiatric disorders, is associated with changes in LFP synchrony. Co-PI Widge has developed algorithms that specifically control inter-regional LFP synchrony, by locking electrical stimulation pulses in one region to the phase of an ongoing oscillation in another region. The translational challenge is that efficient, implantable real-time synchrony monitoring and phase-locked stimulation require signal processing capabilities not found in any existing or anticipated device. Co-PI Shoaran has developed power-efficient phase estimation circuits, specifically optimized for DBS- like implants. We propose to combine these approaches. Aims 1 and 2 will develop a new application- specific integrated circuit (ASIC) that integrates Dr. Shoaran’s measurement and neural decoding frameworks with Dr. Widge’s oscillation-control methods. We will validate this circuit’s recording and phase-locking capabilities in vivo in Dr. Widge’s rodent lab. In Aim 3, a world-leading contract implant manufacturer (Cirtec) will integrate that new ASIC into a packaged, implant-ready device ready for large animal safety testing. Cirtec has already developed a DBS prototyping platform optimized to get new therapies more quickly into first-in- human, allowing us to greatly accelerate the path to the clinic and reduce regulatory risk. At the end of 5 years, we will either be ready for that clinical pilot or have only modest safety testing remaining. Our team has expertise in electronics, medical device fabrication, clinical brain stimulation, and technology commercialization. The work will be headquartered in Minnesota’s “Medical Alley”, an epicenter of medical device innovation. We are well-qualified to execute these Aims and bring the resulting technology to market. Success would yield a new implant optimized for network monitoring and therapy, a powerful new tool for both psychiatric treatment and cutting-edge neuroscience research. Project Narrative We will develop a new implantable medical device for treating severe psychiatric illness, especially mood and anxiety disorders. Many, if not all, of these disorders arise from communication failure in distributed brain networks, networks that communicate through rhythmic, oscillatory firing of large groups of brain cells.

"Sensor-based Just-in Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) Targeting Eating Behavior PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Long-term weight control is difficult to achieve and requires permanent changes in eating behavior. Emerging wearable sensor technology enables accurate and objective measurement of ingestive behavior, and real-time analysis of the sensor data paves the way for development of individually tailored and immediately delivered intervention (just-in-time adaptive Intervention; JITAI) to change eating behavior. Grounded in empirically and theoretically supported behavior change strategies for weight control, the proposed project relies on the synergy of wearable sensor technology, machine learning, behavioral science, personalized medicine, and nutrition to deliver and test such JITAIs. We previously developed a wearable sensor, the Automatic Ingestion Monitor (AIM), that automatically and accurately detects eating and characterizes meal microstructure (e.g., eating duration, rate of ingestion). These data can also be used to accurately estimate energy intake. The goals of this project are to: 1) use the AIM to study two common behavioral patterns observed among individuals with overweight/obesity, namely, excessive total daily energy intake (EI) and fast eating rate; 2) define the optimal personalized triggering metrics for two JITAIs targeting these behaviors; and 3) evaluate JITAIs’ effects on daily energy intake and targeted behaviors. In fulfillment of these goals, we will first conduct a study to characterize the target eating behaviors, then simulate and define triggering metrics for personalized JITAIs to change targeted eating behaviors and decrease EI. The JITAIs are rooted in self-regulation theory (SRT): setting a behavioral goal and monitoring progress toward that goal, with feedback to reinforce success. To enable the SRT-informed JITAIs, we will first use the AIM to collect data about ingestive behaviors quantified by objective, sensor-measured metrics from 90 adults with overweight/obesity who will wear the device for one week in free living conditions. Second, using the collected dataset, we will: a) analyze individual curves of cumulative daily EI and rate of eating within eating episodes to define triggering parameters for personalized JITAI delivery, and b) numerically simulate JITAI delivery and effects. We will then conduct a second study to evaluate the immediate effect of JITAIs on EI and ingestive behavior in free living participants. We will conduct a within-subjects trial with 128 adults wearing the AIM for 7 weeks. To personalize JITAIs, the AIM will learn individual eating patterns over a 1-week run-in period. Each JITAI will be delivered for two weeks (weeks 2-3 and 5-6) in a randomized crossover design with the resulting daily EI and ingestive behavior compared to baseline and the acceptability of the JITAIs assessed via questionnaire. On washout weeks 4 and 7, participants will continue to wear the AIM (no JITAIs) to assess persistence of intervention effects. The proposed project is the first step in demonstrating that AIM-based JITAIs can alter a variety of eating behaviors associated with excess EI. PROJECT NARRATIVE Achievement of changes in eating behaviors that facilitate long-term weight loss and maintenance is elusive. Emerging wearable sensor technology allows for accurate and objective measurement of ingestive behavior. Real-time analysis of the sensor data paves the way for individually tailored just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs) based on empirically and theoretically supported behavior change strategies for healthy eating and weight control. The proposed project relies on synergy of wearable sensor technology, machine learning, behavioral science, personalized medicine, and nutrition to test two such JITAIs driven by the Automatic Ingestion Monitor (AIM), a device that automatically detects and characterize eating behavior in real-time. The information provided by the AIM will be used to implement and test personalized, adaptable behavioral interventions aimed at the reduction of energy intake.",Sensor-based Just-in Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) Targeting Eating Behavior,10005321,R01DK122473,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Energy Intake ', ' Caloric Intake ', ' caloric dietary content ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating Disorders ', ' Feedback ', ' Feeding behaviors ', ' Ingestive Behavior ', ' feeding-related behaviors ', ' nutrient intake activity ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Learning ', ' Mastication ', ' Chewing ', ' chewed ', ' chews ', ' nutrition ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulentia ', ' obese ', ' obese people ', ' obese person ', ' obese population ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Running ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Weight decreased ', ' Weight Loss ', ' Weight Reduction ', ' body weight loss ', ' wt-loss ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' Appetite stimulated ', ' Increased food appetite ', ' increased hunger ', ' increased appetite ', ' Ingestion ', ' sucking ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Cross-Over Designs ', ' Crossover Design ', ' fluid ', ' liquid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Pattern ', ' Over weight ', ' Overweight ', ' behavior change ', ' success ', ' synergism ', ' simulation ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Devices ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' weight control ', ' weight management ', ' Weight maintenance regimen ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Monitor ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' weight maintenance ', ' cost ', ' Population ', ' Eating Behavior ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' intervention effect ', ' clinical practice ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized medicine ', ' healthy weight ', ' precision interventions ', ' personalized intervention ', ' Healthy Eating ', ' body sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' wearable sensor ', ' wearable system ', ' wireless sensor technology ', ' wearable sensor technology ', ' wearable electronics ', ' wearable technology ', ' wearable device ', ' adaptive intervention ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA IN TUSCALOOSA,R01,2020,613085,AL-07,0.02688464155388906
"THE XNAT IMAGING INFORMATICS PLATFORM PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal aims to continue the development of XNAT. XNAT is an imaging informatics platform designed to facilitate common management and productivity tasks for imaging and associated data. We will develop the next generation of XNAT technology to support the ongoing evolution of imaging research. Development will focus on modernizing and expanding the current system. In Aim 1, we will implement new web application infrastructure that includes a new archive file management system, a new event bus to manage cross-service orchestration and a new Javascript library to simplify user interface development. We will also implement new core services, including a Docker Container service, a dynamic scripting engine, and a global XNAT federation. In Aim 2, we will implement two innovative new capabilities that build on the services developed in Aim 1. The XNAT Publisher framework will streamline the process of data sharing by automating the creation and curation of data releases following best practices for data publication and stewardship. The XNAT Machine Learning framework will streamline the development and use of machine learning applications by integrating XNAT with the TensorFlow machine learning environment and implementing provenance and other monitoring features to help avoid the pitfalls that often plague machine learning efforts. For both Aim 1 and 2, all capabilities will be developed and evaluated in the context of real world scientific programs that are actively using the XNAT platform. In Aim 3, we will provide extensive support to the XNAT community, including training workshops, online documentation, discussion forums, and . These activities will be targeted at both XNAT users and developers. RELEVANCE Medical imaging is one of the key methods used by biomedical researchers to study human biology in health and disease.

"Integrate Dynamic System Model and Machine Learning for Calibration-Free Noninvasive ICP Project Summary  No clinical device exists for noninvasive intracranial pressure (nICP) assessment. Past attempts have focused on identifying ICP-related signals that are noninvasively measureable, but have done little to address the calibration problem. Without calibration, only ICP trending can be inferred at the best. However, noninvasive calibration is not trivial. A universal calibration will fail because individual patients require different calibration to obtain accurate results. On the other hand, the use of plain regression for individualized calibration is infeasible because ICP cannot be obtained noninvasively for a de novo patient to begin with.  Invasive ICP monitoring remains a standard of care and this can be leveraged to continuously grow a database of ICP, noninvasive signals, and different calibration equations, e.g., each built from a pair of invasive ICP and noninvasive signal in the database. Then nICP becomes feasible by selecting from a rich set of calibration equations the optimal choice for a de novo patient. In this project, we will pursue three aims that will lead to the development of an accurate noninvasive ICP system based on Transcranial Doppler. These aims are: 1) To implement and validate core algorithms needed for achieving accurate nICP; 2) To test if estimated nICP is sensitive to variations in ultrasound probe placement; 3) To test the generalizability of the proposed nICP approach.  Large epidemiologic surveys reveal that ICP is monitored in only about 58% of US patients when ICP monitoring is indicated. It is a smaller percentage (37%) in European patients and even fewer in developing countries. The proposed nICP approach does not have the high risks associated with invasive ICP, requires no onsite neurosurgical expertise, and can be economically deployed and readily practiced. Therefore, its potential impact is enormous. Project Narrative  No clinically accepted device exists for noninvasive intracranial pressure (ICP) assessment.

"mIQa: A Highly Scalable and Customizable Platform for Medical Image Quality Assessment - Phase II 1 Project Summary NIH is increasing its investment in large, multi-center brain MRI studies via projects such as the recently announced BRAIN initiative. The success of these studies depends on the quality of MRIs and the resulting image measurements, regardless of sample size. Even though quality control of MRIs and corresponding measurements could be outsourced, most neuroscience studies rely on in-house procedures that combine automatically generated scores with manually guided checks, such as visual inspection. Implementing these procedures typically requires combining several software systems. For example, the NIH NIAAA- and BD2K- funded Data Analysis Resource (DAR) of the National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA) uses XNAT to consolidate the structural, diffusion, and functional MRIs acquired across five sites, and has also developed their own custom software package to comply with study requirements for a multi-tier, quality control (QC) workflow. However, these custom, one-off tools lack support for the multi-site QC workflows that will come with the unified platform that MIQA represents: a design that supports collaboration and sharing, and strong cohesion between technologies. To improve the effectiveness of QC efforts specific to multi-center neuroimaging studies, we will develop a widely accessible and broadly compatible software platform that simplifies the creation of custom QC workflows in compliance with study requirements, provides core functionality for performing QC of medical images, and automatically generates documentation compliant with the FAIR principle, i.e., making scientific results findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable.  Specifically, our multi-site, web-based software platform for Medical Image Quality Assurance (MIQA) will enable efficient and accurate QC processing by leveraging open-source, state-of-the-art web interface technologies, such as a web-based dataset caching system and machine learning to aid in QC processes. Users will be able to configure workflows that not only reflect the specific requirements of medical imaging studies but also minimize the time spent on labor-intensive operations, such as visually reviewing scans. Issue tracking technology will enhance communication between geographically-distributed team members, as they can easily share image annotations and receive automated notifications of outstanding QC issues. The system will be easy to deploy as it will be able to interface with various imaging storage backends, such as local file systems and XNAT. While parts of this functionality have been developed elsewhere, MIQA is unique as it provides a unified, standard interface for efficient QC setup, maintenance, and review for projects analyzing multiple, independently managed data sources.  The usefulness of this unique QC system will be demonstrated on increasing the efficiency of the diverse QC team of the multi-center NCANDA study. Narrative The goal of this proposal is to develop a web-based, multi-site, open-source platform for Medical Image Quality Assurance (MIQA) to address the QC needs of geographically diverse teams using small and large medical image-based studies alike. MIQA will enable efficient and accurate QC processing by levering state-of-the-art machine learning, data management, and web interface technologies. Our effort will minimize the time spent on labor-intensive reviews and analysis operations by supporting team-oriented reviewing that is guided by highly customizable workflows seamlessly interacting with existing data management systems.",mIQa: A Highly Scalable and Customizable Platform for Medical Image Quality Assessment - Phase II,10010814,R44MH119022,"['Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Archives ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communication ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Sources ', ' Diffusion ', ' Evaluation Studies ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Intelligence ', ' Investments ', ' Iowa ', ' Learning ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Maintenance ', ' Manuals ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Online Systems ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' online computer ', ' web based ', ' Peer Review ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Quality Control ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Running ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Generations ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' quality assurance ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' brain visualization ', ' Brain imaging ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Visual ', ' Licensing ', ' Measurement ', ' Sample Size ', ' Cooperative Learning ', ' Experiential Learning ', ' Active Learning ', ' Funding ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Internet ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Notification ', ' Scanning ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' data management ', ' success ', ' cohesion ', ' Neural Development ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' member ', ' research study ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Documentation ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Update ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' cost ', ' software systems ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' NIAAA ', ' National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' computational resources ', ' computing resources ', ' Image data archive ', ' image archive ', ' image library ', ' picture archive ', ' image archival system ', ' 4-dimensional ', ' Four-dimensional ', ' web interface ', ' open source ', ' operation ', ' Data Provenance ', ' dexterity ', ' Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies initiative ', ' BRAIN initiative ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' learning strategy ', ' BD2K ', ' Big Data to Knowledge ', ' FAIR data ', ' Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable ', ' FAIR principles ', ' annotation framework ', ' annotation tool ', ' annotation  system ', ' imaging study ', ' deep learning ', ' learning algorithm ', ' Data Management System ', ' Data Management Resources ', ' Visualization ', ' 3-D visualization ', ' 3-dimensional visualization ', ' 3D visualization ', ' three-dimensional visualization ', ' ']",NIMH,"KITWARE, INC.",R44,2020,819293,NY-20,-0.0024115746259591384
"BRAIN INITIATIVE RESOURCE: DEVELOPMENT OF A HUMAN NEUROELECTROMAGNETIC DATA ARCHIVE AND TOOLS RESOURCE (NEMAR) To take advantage of recent and ongoing advances in intensive and large-scale computational methods, and to preserve the scientific data created by publicly funded research projects, data archives must be created as well as standards for specifying, identifying, and annotating deposited data. The value of and interest in such archives among researchers can be greatly increased by adding to them an active computational capability and framework of analysis and search tools that support further analysis as well as larger scale meta-analysis and large scale data mining. The OpenNeuro.org archive, begun as a repository for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, is such an archive. We propose to build a gateway to OpenNeuro for human electrophysiology data (EEG and MEG, as well as intracranial data recorded from clinical patients to plan brain surgeries or other therapies) – herein we refer to these modalities as neuroelectromagnetic (NEM) data. The Neuroelectromagnetic Data Archive and Tools Resource (NEMAR) at the San Diego Supercomputer Center will act as a gateway to OpenNeuro for NEM data research. Such data uploaded to NEMAR at SDSC will be deposited in the OpenNeuro archive. Still- private NEM data in OpenNeuro will, on user request, be copied to the NEMAR gateway for further user processing using the XSEDE high-performance resources at SDSC in conjunction with The Neuroscience Gateway (nsgportal.org), a freely available and easy to use portal to use of high-performance computing resources for neuroscience research. Publicly available OpenNeuro NEM data will be able to be analyzed by running verified analysis applications on the OpenNeuro system. In this project we will build an application to evaluate the quality of uploaded NEM data, and another to visualize the data, for EEG and MEG at both the scalp and brain source levels, including time-domain and frequency-domain dynamics time locked to sets of experimental events learned from the BIDS- and HED-formatted data annotations. The NEMAR gateway will take a major step toward applying machine learning methods to a large store of carefully collected and stored human electrophysiologic brain data to spur new developments in basic and clinical brain research. The NEMAR gateway to the OpenNeuro.org human neuroimaging data archive will build tools to add human electrical and magnetic brain activity records to the archive, to evaluate its quality for users and visualize its features. The resulting facility will allow applications of new machine learning methods to research on human brain dynamics that can be expected to lead to breakthroughs in understanding how the human brain supports our awareness and behavior in both health and disease.",BRAIN INITIATIVE RESOURCE: DEVELOPMENT OF A HUMAN NEUROELECTROMAGNETIC DATA ARCHIVE AND TOOLS RESOURCE (NEMAR),9985198,R24MH120037,"['Archives ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Communities ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Libraries ', ' Magnetoencephalography ', ' MEG imaging ', ' magnetoencephalographic imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Mining ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Patients ', ' Privatization ', ' Quality Control ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Running ', ' Scalp structure ', ' Scalp ', ' Science ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' brain surgery ', ' brain visualization ', ' Brain imaging ', ' Clinical ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Evaluation ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' data quality ', ' data retrieval ', ' data storage ', ' Data Storage and Retrieval ', ' Funding ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Internet ', ' Descriptor ', ' Spottings ', ' Staging ', ' Deposit ', ' Deposition ', ' tool ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Frequencies ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' magnetic ', ' Magnetism ', ' Performance ', ' supercomputer ', ' high-end computing ', ' High Performance Computing ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' Modality ', ' response ', ' depository ', ' repository ', ' Magnetic Resonance ', ' Documentation ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' data processing ', ' computerized data processing ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' Base of the Brain ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Resource Development ', ' Neurosciences Research ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' web-based service ', ' web services ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' cyberinfrastructure ', ' cyber infrastructure ', ' visualization tool ', ' Visualization software ', ' computational resources ', ' computing resources ', ' data structure ', ' web interface ', ' brain research ', ' tool development ', ' data format ', ' Cloud Infrastructure ', ' cloud computer ', ' Cloud Computing ', ' Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies initiative ', ' BRAIN initiative ', ' built environment ', ' support tools ', ' hack day ', ' hackfest ', ' hackathon ', ' data library ', ' data archive ', ' preservation ', ' data deposition ', ' data submission ', ' Infrastructure ', ' computing platform ', ' computational platform ', ' data tools ', ' data processing pipeline ', ' data analysis pipeline ', ' structured data ', ' large scale data sets ', ' large scale datasets ', ' large scale data ', ' data curation ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R24,2020,900723,CA-52,0.007478729699320322
"LifeSense: Transforming Behavioral Assessment of Depression Using Personal Sensing Technology Abstract Depression is common, costly, and a leading cause of disability. Assessment of behavior and experience related to depression has tended to rely on self-report and interview-based methods. Environmental momentary assessment inserts assessment into people's lives, but still requires active engagement by those being evaluated. We propose to develop and validate a mobile phone-based personal sensing system to detect depression and related behaviors that relies on sensor data that are collected continuously and unobtrusively. Because people tend to keep their phones with them, the mobile phone is an ideal sensing platform, as it can continuously collect data in the context of the individual's life with no ongoing effort on the part of the user. Such systems are already being used to detect simple behaviors, such as activity recognition and sleep quantification, which are more proximal to the sensor data. Aim 1 will develop markers for a broad range of behavioral targets related to symptoms of major depressive episode (MDE; anhedonia, negative mood, sleep disruption, psychomotor activity, fatigue, and diminished concentration) and related domains (e.g. social functioning, stress, motivation) across a representative sample of participants. Aim 2 will combine all behavioral targets using machine learning to 1) estimate MDE and symptom severity cross-sectionally, 2) identify transition from non-depressed to depressed states, and depressed to non-depressed states, and 3) predict MDE and symptom severity 4 and 8 weeks out. Aim 3 will seek to understand the complex relationships among behavioral targets and depression. We will accomplish this by enrolling 1200 representative participants, in six 4-month waves of data collection. Each participant will download software that collects a wide variety of sensor data (GPS, accelerometry, light, Bluetooth, phone usage, etc.) and an app that collects ecological momentary assessments (EMA). Following each wave we will develop algorithms for a subset of behavioral targets and features (a definition of raw sensor data that incorporates meaning, like translating GPS data into “home”). Each algorithm will then be validated in the subsequent wave. After 5 waves (1000 participants), the set of all markers of behavioral targets and features will be combined using machine learning to detect and predict depression. This hierarchical approach extracts information from data at multiple levels, which ultimately is far more likely to succeed than relying solely on raw sensor data. The final wave will serve to replicate and validate the entire depression prediction model. This sensing platform is scientifically significant, as it will provide a fundamentally new tool for obtaining continuous, objective markers of behavior that are relevant to depression, as well as many other psychiatric and medical disorders. This project has the potential develop new understandings into the etiology of depression. It is clinically significant, as it will allow for continuous, effortless assessment of populations at risk for depression and ongoing evaluation during treatment. Project Narrative We propose to develop a sensing platform that uses mobile phone sensor data to detect a broad range of behaviors related to depression, as well as detect and predict depressive states that require treatment. This system will be able to run unobtrusively and continuously on people's phones. This sensing platform will provide a fundamentally new method of obtaining continuous, objective markers of behavior that are relevant to depression, as well as many other psychiatric and medical disorders.",LifeSense: Transforming Behavioral Assessment of Depression Using Personal Sensing Technology,9982127,R01MH111610,"['Algorithms ', ' Behavior ', ' Sampling Biases ', ' Systematic Bias ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Data Collection ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Fatigue ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human Activities ', ' Interview ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' single episode major depressive disorder ', ' Single major depression ', ' Single major depressive episode ', ' major depressive episode ', ' single episode Major Depression ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Motivation ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Persons ', ' Noise ', ' Periodicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Psychologist ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Rewards ', ' Running ', ' Sleep ', ' Sleep disturbances ', ' aberrant sleep ', ' disrupted sleep ', ' disturbed sleep ', ' impaired sleep ', ' poor sleep ', ' sleep disruption ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Stress ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Textiles ', ' fabric ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Measures ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Anhedonia ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Evaluation ', ' disability ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Measurement ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' depressed ', ' sadness ', ' Depressed mood ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' computer science ', ' Structure ', ' pleasure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Devices ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' Genomics ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Car Phone ', ' behavioral assessment ', ' Behavior assessment ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Collection ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Monitor ', ' Text ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Social Functioning ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' next generation ', ' touch panel ', ' touch screen ', ' touch screen panel ', ' touchscreen panel ', ' touchscreen ', ' negative mood ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinically significant ', ' health application ', ' wi-fi ', ' wireless fidelity ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' treatment response ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' accelerometry ', ' activity monitor ', ' activity tracker ', ' Accelerometer ', ' Bluetooth ', ' sensing technology ', ' sensor technology ', ' wearable electronics ', ' wearable technology ', ' wearable device ', ' microphone ', ' ']",NIMH,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2020,822373,IL-07,-0.009940426045506871
"Abiotic-Biotic Interfaces for Ophthalmology Symposium ABSTRACT This proposal seeks funding to support a symposium, Abiotic-Biotic Interfaces for Ophthalmology (ABI), which will bring together recognized world experts in clinical, research, vision science, engineering, industrial and pharmaceutical communities as well as junior investigators (i.e., young faculty and those in training) to discuss the current state of ABI, ranging from bioelectronic implantable and wearable devices, to nanoscale scaffolds for stem cell and gene therapies. Given the multidisciplinary nature of this field, it is essential to bring together researchers and clinicians with varying levels of expertise across many domains related to ABI to advance the progress of this novel field, identify challenges of advancement, and develop a strategic action plan to overcome these challenges. The timing to have such a symposium to further the application of implantable and/or wearable bioengineered systems in ophthalmology is now as we focus on precision and personalized medicine and leverage the revolution in deep learning artificial intelligence algorithms. Through symposium talks, sessions, and discussions we will cover the fundamentals and also identify innovative and cutting-edge strategies and methodologies to accelerate the rate of major discoveries and development of novel therapeutics. The specific aims of this symposium are: Specific Aim 1. To bring together both established and junior investigators representing a broad range of disciplines to discuss cutting edge research in this novel field, catalyze the development of cross-disciplinary and translational approaches to advance abiotic-biotic interfaces for ophthalmology, and identify gaps in knowledge and barriers to advancement. We will identify research questions and develop an agenda to guide future research that is consistent with the objectives and interests of NEI. Specific Aim 2. Develop a junior investigator program to motivate a diverse group of students and junior investigators to pursue research careers in vision science and ophthalmologic therapeutic development, who will ultimately submit grant proposals to NEI solicitations and contribute to the scientific literature. Specific Aim 3. Develop a strategic action plan to set priorities for future studies that will encourage inter-agency collaborations (e.g., NEI, NSF, DARPA, etc.). This is critical because often certain engineering tasks are best suited to be supported by NSF or DARPA whereas the biological testing of the engineered systems lends itself to funding from NEI. Hence such inter-agency or cross-agency efforts can help leverage the funding to develop sophisticated abiotic-biotic systems NARRATIVE This meeting is the first on this topic dedicated to the broad use of implantable and/or wearable bioelectronics for ophthalmological applications. It is anticipated that the strategic action plan will significantly impact the field by greatly accelerating the translation of basic science and engineering research findings to stimulate the development of novel treatments and improve clinical practice. Key topics include visual restoration, drug and gene delivery, and sensing intraocular pressure. This meeting will foster training and development of future leaders in this emerging field and promote collaboration and exchange of knowledge and ideas among junior and established investigators.",Abiotic-Biotic Interfaces for Ophthalmology Symposium,10070800,R13EY031988,"['Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' Biological Testing ', ' Data ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Retina Proper ', ' Neural Retina ', ' Senior Scientist ', ' Gene Delivery ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' nano meter scale ', ' nano meter sized ', ' nano scale ', ' nanometer scale ', ' nanometer sized ', ' nanoscale ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' translation strategy ', ' translational strategy ', ' translational approach ', ' visual science ', ' vision science ', ' therapeutic agent development ', ' therapeutic development ', ' clinical practice ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' precision medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized medicine ', ' Scientific Inquiry ', ' wearable electronics ', ' wearable technology ', ' wearable device ', ' deep learning ', ' neural network ', ' Virtual and Augmented reality ', ' smart algorithm ', ' intelligent algorithm ', ' Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Biomedical Engineering ', ' bio-engineered ', ' bio-engineers ', ' bioengineering ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communities ', ' Contact Lenses ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electronics ', ' electronic device ', ' Engineering ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Faculty ', ' Future ', ' gene therapy ', ' DNA Therapy ', ' Gene Transfer Clinical ', ' Genetic Intervention ', ' gene-based therapy ', ' genetic therapy ', ' genomic therapy ', ' Glass ', ' implantable device ', ' biomedical implant ', ' implant device ', ' indwelling device ', ' Industrialization ', ' Physiologic Intraocular Pressure ', ' Intraocular Pressure ', ' Ocular Tension ', ' intra-ocular pressure ', ' Intraocular lens implant device ', ' Intraocular Lenses ', ' Literature ', ' Medicine ', ' Methodology ', ' Ophthalmology ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Students ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' Drug Delivery Systems ', ' Drug Delivery ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' symposium ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Training ', ' Visual ', ' Discipline ', ' Fostering ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' scaffolding ', ' scaffold ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Route ', ' System ', ' restoration ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' novel ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' Devices ', ' stem cell therapeutics ', ' stem cell treatment ', ' stem cell-based treatment ', ' stem cell therapy ', ' portability ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' ']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R13,2020,42465,CA-37,-0.0015789741863591576
"Development of assistive self-care robot technologies for people with disabilities Towards Autonomy in Daily Living: A Formalism for Intelligent Assistive Feeding Systems  Applicant PI, Tapomayukh Bhattacharjee Overview We propose to develop a design space framework and co-design methodology for the development of assistive self-care robot technologies that are informed by the social model of disability. Our model of assistive robots in the domain of self-care considers an individual's social and environmental context, coping processes and other factors that can affect independent functioning. Our design methods utilize embedded sensing to intelligently respond to these con- siderations. We speciﬁcally focus on assistive feeding tasks, proposing a formalism that enables a robotic system to feed a person with upper-extremity disability. Our guiding principle is that human-level interaction is feasible only if the robot itself relies on human-level semantics. We im- plement this principle by relying on data to learn and develop object-dependent control policies and timing models for acquiring and transferring a bite to a user at a proper time. The system's ob- server detects world states and arbitrator invokes different control policies based on these states. The tangible result will be an intelligent assistive feeding robot whose performance can generalize to different activities, adapt to user preferences, and recover from failures. Objectives and Relevance to NIH A design framework for assistive robots would provide for- malisms that let us address the fundamental challenge of designing robots that are responsive to context of use and support assisted self-care in a variety of social settings. We combine method- ologies from human-robot interaction, cognitive science, machine learning, robotics and haptics with user studies and our formalism to address the following research questions: (Q1) Mechanics of Feeding-Control Policies: How can control policies be designed for dexterous non-prehensile manipu- lation of deformable objects such as food? (Q2) Social Aspects of Feeding-Bite Timing: How should an assistive feeding robot decide the right timing for feeding a user? (Q3) Human-in-the-Loop: How can human-directed feedback be added into the loop for an autonomous assistive feeding system?  The proposed work will allow users with upper-arm disabilities to use this system for intelli- gent assistance with daily feeding tasks. This can in turn help them increase their independence and autonomy making eating easier and more enjoyable. While we presently focus on this spe- ciﬁc application, the tools and insights we gain can generalize to the ﬁelds of robotic assistance and human-robot interaction across other activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living. Thus, our work is clearly motivated by the intent to improve the quality of health and life of the aging population and is very relevant to the theme of NIH. 1 Towards Autonomy in Daily Living: A Formalism for Intelligent Assistive Feeding Systems  Applicant PI, Tapomayukh Bhattacharjee  The proposed work will allow users with upper-arm disabilities to use this system for intelli- gent assistance with daily feeding tasks, potentially increasing their independence and autonomy making eating easier and more enjoyable. The long-term promise of this research is to have robots in society that are able to seamlessly and ﬂuently perform complex manipulation tasks in dynamic human environments in real homes which could impact individuals with other disabilities as well as able-bodied individuals. Through improved access to independent living and customizing to the unique needs and preferences of users, the results of this project can positively impact mil- lions of people worldwide, especially given the vast variability in our target population by being transformational in the scalability of assistive robotics for self-care. 1",Development of assistive self-care robot technologies for people with disabilities,9907705,F32HD101192,"['Activities of Daily Living ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' daily living functionality ', ' functional ability ', ' functional capacity ', ' Affect ', ' Aging ', ' Bite ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Communities ', ' Cues ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Sterile coverings ', ' Dressing ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Environment ', ' Expert Systems ', ' Intelligent systems ', ' Family ', ' Feedback ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Handicapped ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' disabled ', ' disabled individual ', ' disabled people ', ' individuals with disabilities ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Independent Living ', ' Intelligence ', ' Learning ', ' Panthera leo ', ' Lions ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Parents ', ' Play ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Robotics ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Self Care ', ' personal care ', ' Semantics ', ' Societies ', ' Target Populations ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Tweens ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' General Taxonomy ', ' Taxonomy ', ' Baths ', ' Bathing ', ' Caring ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' human subject ', ' improved ', ' disability ', ' Failure ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Robot ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' cognitive psychology ', ' Cognitive Science ', ' Life ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Complex ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Upper arm ', ' System ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' social model ', ' intergenerational ', ' kinematic model ', ' kinematics ', ' peer ', ' social ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Care giver Burden ', ' care giver stress ', ' caregiver stress ', ' Caregiver Burden ', ' Membrum superius ', ' Upper Limb ', ' Upper Extremity ', ' IADL ', ' instrumental activity of daily living ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' feeding ', ' robot assisted ', ' robotic assistance ', ' robot assistance ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' haptics ', ' aged population ', ' population aging ', ' aging population ', ' care receiver ', ' care recipients ', ' human-robot interaction ', ' human-in-the-loop ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' robotic system ', ' assistive robot ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,F32,2020,65310,WA-07,0.019760317306072087
"Development of an Integrated System for Monitoring Home-Cage Behavior in Non-Human Primates 7: Project Summary/Abstract Marmosets are emerging as an important model species for neuroscience research, driven by the development of new technologies such as CRISPR that allow targeted genetic modifications in this species. These developments will allow primate research to take advantage of powerful genetic tools that were previously restricted largely to rodents, including optogenetics, genetic activity reporters, and targeted mutation of endogenous genes implicated in brain function and human disease. Marmosets are well suited to this approach, being small and fast-breeding compared to most primates. They are typically housed in family groups, and exhibit a variety of social behaviors in captivity including complex vocal repertoires. Marmosets thus represent a promising system for studying social behavior and other cognitive functions in a primate model, and they also hold great promise for modeling brain disorders that affect cognitive functions that are difficult to study in other species such as rodents. To take full advantage of these emerging animal models, it is necessary to develop new methods for analyzing their behavior, including naturalistic social interactions that are imperfectly captured by standardized behavioral tasks. We therefore plan to develop a system for automated analysis of marmoset behaviors in the home cage. The system will consist of an integrated array of sensors including video cameras, depth sensors, and collar-mounted wearable microphones. The resulting multimodal data will be synchronized and analyzed using methods from computer vision, speech processing, machine learning, and multimodal data analysis. Specifically we will formulate the tracking analysis as a probabilistic graphical model, which will allow video data to be integrated with audio recordings, and with other modalities that could be explored in future, including inertial motion sensors, physiological recordings and other contextual data. Based on this approach we will develop methods to classify calls, identify individual callers, track the locations and identities of each animal in three dimensions, and classify different actions, including interactions between individuals. We envisage that our system will be useful for a wide range of studies in basic and translational neuroscience, and in particular it will be useful for studying behavioral phenotypes in genetic models of human psychiatric disorders, and for relating behavioral abnormalities to their underlying genetic and neural causes. 8: Project Narrative: We propose to develop an automated system for monitoring the behavior of marmosets in the home cage environment. The proposed system will measure a wide range of naturalistic behaviors including vocal and social interactions, and will be useful for studying animal models of psychiatric disorders such as autism and schizophrenia, in which these behaviors are disrupted. This in turn will allow researchers to relate behavioral abnormalities to their underlying neural and genetic causes, an essential step toward the understanding and eventual treatment of these disorders.",Development of an Integrated System for Monitoring Home-Cage Behavior in Non-Human Primates,9901577,R01MH111916,"['Acoustics ', ' Acoustic ', ' Affect ', ' Animals ', ' Behavior ', ' Animal Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Breeding ', ' Callithrix ', ' Hapale ', ' Marmosets ', ' Short-Tusked Marmoset ', ' Computer Systems ', ' computing system ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Grooming ', ' Head ', ' Housing ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Language Development ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' language acquisition ', ' language learning ', ' Methods ', ' Genetic Models ', ' Motion ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Noise ', ' Parents ', ' Pathology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Posture ', ' Primates ', ' Primates Mammals ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Sleep ', ' Social Behavior ', ' sociobehavior ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Standardization ', ' Time ', ' Video Recording ', ' Videorecording ', ' video recording system ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Training ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' non-human primate ', ' nonhuman primate ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Genetic ', ' Reporter ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' cognitive function ', ' Complex ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Location ', ' vibration ', ' vocalization ', ' gaze ', ' limb movement ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' offspring ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Modality ', ' Modeling ', ' vocal learning ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' Neurosciences Research ', ' Scheme ', ' wireless ', ' Wireless Technology ', ' Pathologic ', ' Monitor ', ' Modification ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' feeding ', ' behavioral monitoring ', ' Behavior monitoring ', ' social communication ', ' human disease ', ' speech processing ', ' multi-modality ', ' multimodality ', ' translational neuroscience ', ' optogenetics ', ' CRISPR ', ' CRISPR/Cas system ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats ', ' behavior study ', ' behavioral study ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' model of human ', ' human model ', ' microphone ', ' multi-modal data ', ' multi-modal datasets ', ' multimodal datasets ', ' multimodal data ', ' automated analysis ', ' social defects ', ' social disorders ', ' social dysfunction ', ' social deficits ', ' motion sensor ', ' multiple data sources ', ' data streams ', ' machine learning method ', ' behavior phenotype ', ' behavioral phenotyping ', ' ']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2020,521954,MA-07,-0.004245150736480614
"Intelligent deployment of containerized bioinformatics workflows on the cloud PROJECT SUMMARY Cloud computing has emerged as a promising solution to address the challenges of big data. Public cloud vendors provide computing as-a-utility enabling users to pay only for the resources that are actually used. In this application, we will develop methods and tools to enable biomedical researchers to optimize the costs of cloud computing when analyzing biomedical big data. Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) cloud provides computing as a utility, on-demand, to end users, enabling cloud resources to be rapidly provisioned and scaled to meet computational and performance requirements. In addition, dynamic intelligent allocation of cloud computing resources has great potential to both improve performance and reduce hosting costs. Unfortunately, determining the most cost-effective and efficient ways to deploy modules on the cloud is non- trivial, due to a plethora of cloud vendors, each providing different types of virtual machines with different capabilities, performance trade-offs, and pricing structures. In addition, modern bioinformatics workflows consist of multiple modules, applications and libraries, each with their own set of software dependencies. Software containers package binary executables and scripts into modules with their software dependencies. With containers that compartmentalize software dependencies, modules implemented as containers can be mixed and matched to create workflows that give identical results on any platform. The high degree of reproducibility and flexibility of software containers makes them ideal instruments for disseminating complex bioinformatics workflows. Our overarching goal is to deliver the latest technological advances in containers and cloud computing to a typical biomedical researcher with limited resources who works with big data. Specifically, we will develop a user-friendly drag-and-drop interface to enable biomedical researchers to build and edit containerized workflows. Most importantly, users can choose to deploy and scale selected modules in the workflow on cloud computing platforms in a transparent, yet guided fashion, to optimize cost and performance. Our aim is to provide a federated approach that leverages resources from multiple cloud vendors. We have assembled a team of interdisciplinary scientists with expertise in bioinformatics, cloud and distributed computing, and machine learning. As part of this application, we will work closely with end users who routinely generate and analyze RNA-seq data. We will illustrate how our containerized, cloud-enabled methods and tools will benefit bioinformatics analyses. Project Narrative Cloud computing has emerged as a promising solution to address the challenge of analyzing diverse and massive data generated to advance our understanding of health and diseases. We will develop methods and tools to build and intelligently deploy modular and cloud-enabled bioinformatics workflows.

"Incorporating Learning Effects into Medical Device Active Safety Surveillance Methods Implantable medical devices have revolutionized contemporary cardiovascular care, and are used in a wide spectrum of acute and chronic cardiovascular conditions. However, medical device design fault or incorrect use may lead to significant risk of patient injury and represents an important preventable public health risk in the United States. To help identify device-related safety issues, a strategy of active, prospective, post-market safety surveillance has been recommended by the FDA, and evaluated methodologically. This type of surveillance offers significant advantages over traditional adverse event reporting strategies. However, all such approaches are challenged by the need to incorporate learning effects into expectations regarding safety. These learning impacts been repeatedly shown to have dramatic impacts on outcomes during early device experience. Quantifying learning effects on the outcomes associated with high-risk cardiovascular devices will improve our understanding of intrinsic device performance, thereby identifying patient populations best treated with such devices while simultaneously providing necessary feedback to device manufacturers to support iterative improvement in device design. Separately, understanding the impacts of learning may identify opportunities for targeted training as well as help to tease apart institutional and operator characteristics that may accelerate the achievement of optimal outcomes in the use of the specific cardiovascular device.  This proposal seeks to extend the previously validated, open-source, active, prospective device safety surveillance tool, by developing and validating robust learning curve (LC) detection and quantification algorithms, designed to simultaneously account for the effects at the operator and institutional levels. We propose a “blinded” development strategy, in which one team will generate robust synthetic clinical data simulator with LC impacts, and the other team develops and applies LC detection and quantification algorithms, without knowledge of the underlying relationships, determine performance and accuracy through sequential refinement and validation steps. We propose to formally validate the optimized LC tools in real-world data through re-analysis of previously published LC effects on transcatheter valves and vascular closure devices using national cardiovascular registries. In addition, the LC tools will be incorporated into two active, prospective device safety surveillance studies of novel implantable cardiovascular devices using large clinical registries. This proposal seeks to understand the impact of institutional and physician learning on the safety of newly approved cardiovascular devices, and to use this knowledge to support and improve effective medical device safety surveillance. We propose a “blinded” strategy of separating simulated dataset generation from the learning effects detection and quantification algorithm development. Incorporating learning effects adjustment into a validated, prospective, near-real-time safety surveillance system, this research will improve public health by identifying poorer performing cardiovascular devices, and provide physicians, device manufacturers and public health officials with better information to optimize the use of medical devices, iteratively improve their design, and identify opportunities for enhanced training that will result in improved patient outcomes.",Incorporating Learning Effects into Medical Device Active Safety Surveillance Methods,9863048,R01HL149948,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Algorithms ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Data Aggregation ', ' Aggregated Data ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Feedback ', ' implantable device ', ' biomedical implant ', ' implant device ', ' indwelling device ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Medical Device Designs ', ' Medical Device Safety ', ' Medical Device ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Registries ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Generations ', ' Device Designs ', ' Device Safety ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Blinded ', ' Caring ', ' injuries ', ' Injury ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' Modeling ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' Manufacturer ', ' Manufacturer Name ', ' Provider ', ' Institution ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Surveillance Methods ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' systems research ', ' post-market ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' Implant ', ' open source ', ' high risk ', ' patient population ', ' surveillance strategy ', ' surveillance study ', ' adverse consequence ', ' adverse outcome ', ' Algorithmic Design ', ' Algorithmic Engineering ', ' algorithm engineering ', ' algorithmic composition ', ' Algorithm Design ', ' Data Analytics ', ' Injections ', ' clinical heterogeneity ', ' algorithm development ', ' safety outcomes ', ' ']",NHLBI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,828534,TN-05,0.019057387014155148
"Scalable Software for Distributed Processing and Visualization of Multi-Site MEG/EEG Datasets Project Summary During the past three decades non-invasive functional brain imaging has developed immensely in terms of measurement technologies, analysis methods, and innovative paradigms to capture information about brain function both in healthy and diseased individuals. Although functional MRI (fMRI) has become very useful, it only provides indirect information about neuronal activity through the neurovascular coupling with a limited temporal resolution. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) remain the only available noninvasive techniques capable of directly measuring the electrophysiological activity with a millisecond resolution. During the past eight years we have developed, with NIH support, the MNE-Python software, which covers multiple methods of data preprocessing, source localization, statistical analysis, and estimation of functional connectivity between distributed brain regions. All algorithms and utility functions are implemented in a consistent manner with well-documented interfaces, enabling users to create M/EEG data analysis pipelines by writing Python scripts. To further extend our software to meet the needs of a growing user base and reflect recent developments in the MEG/EEG field we will pursue three specific Aims. In Aim 1 we will: (i) Create an all-embracing suite of noise cancellation tools incorporating and extending methods present in different MEG systems; (ii) Implement device independent methods for head-movement determination and compensation on the basis of head movement data recorded during a MEG session; (iii) Develop methods for automatic tagging of artifacts using machine learning approaches. In Aim 2 our focus is to extend the software to make modern distributed computing resources easily usable in processing and to allow for remote visualization without the need to move large amounts of data across the network. Finally, in Aim 3, we will continue to develop MNE-Python using best programming practices ensuring multiplatform compatibility, extensive web-based documentation, training and forums, and hands-on training workshops. As a result of these developments the MNE-Python will be able to effectively process large number of subjects and huge amounts data ensuing and from multi-site studies harmoniously across different MEG/EEG systems. Narrative MEG and EEG can be used to understand and diagnose abnormalities underlying a wide range neurological and psychiatric illnesses including epilepsy, schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, autism spectrum disorders, and Alzheimer's disease, as well as cognitive deficits such as delayed acquisition of language. However, widespread use of these methods especially in large populations has been problematic because of the lack of well-established analysis approaches, which map the sensor data into the brain space for detailed temporal, spatial, and connectivity analysis. This research will provide well-documented and tested novel analysis software to promote both basic neuroscience and clinical research applications using MEG and EEG.",Scalable Software for Distributed Processing and Visualization of Multi-Site MEG/EEG Datasets,9934294,R01NS104585,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Head ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Laboratories ', ' Language Development ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' language acquisition ', ' language learning ', ' Magnetoencephalography ', ' MEG imaging ', ' magnetoencephalographic imaging ', ' Maintenance ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Noise ', ' Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder ', ' Obsessive-Compulsive Neurosis ', ' Online Systems ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' online computer ', ' web based ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Science ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Writing ', ' Measures ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' falls ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' symposium ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Ecologic Systems ', ' Ecological Systems ', ' Ecosystem ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' brain visualization ', ' Brain imaging ', ' Site ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Pythons ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Compensation ', ' Financial compensation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Measurement ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Head Movements ', ' Scientist ', ' Msec ', ' millisecond ', ' Hour ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' human data ', ' cognitive defects ', ' Cognitive deficits ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' Documentation ', ' Brain region ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Resolution ', ' Neurosciences Research ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' data grid ', ' datagrid ', ' distributed computing ', ' cluster computing ', ' visualization tool ', ' Visualization software ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' data acquisition ', ' computational resources ', ' computing resources ', ' open source ', ' multithreading ', ' data transfer ', ' data transmission ', ' data exchange ', ' verification and validation ', ' Cloud Infrastructure ', ' cloud computer ', ' Cloud Computing ', ' cloud based ', ' temporal resolution ', ' time measurement ', ' temporal measurement ', ' pedagogy ', ' neuro-vascular coupling ', ' neurovascular coupling ', ' source localization ', ' sensing technology ', ' sensor technology ', ' Data Scientist ', ' analysis pipeline ', ' Visualization ', ' data processing pipeline ', ' data analysis pipeline ', ' large data sets ', ' large datasets ', ' ']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,543993,MA-08,-0.004708745573298284
"Inferential methods for functional data from wearable devices Project Summary/Abstract This is a project to develop new statistical methods for comparing groups of subjects in terms of health outcomes that are assessed using data from wearable devices. Inexpensive wearable sensors for health monitoring are now capable of generating massive amounts of data collected longitudinally, up to months at a time. The project will develop inferential methods that can deal with the complexity of such data. A serious challenge is the presence of unmeasured time-dependent confounders (e.g., circadian and dietary patterns), making direct comparisons or borrowing strength across subjects untenable unless the studies are carried out in controlled experimental con- ditions. Generic data mining and machine learning tools have been widely used to provide predictions of health status from such data. However, such tools cannot be used for signiﬁcance testing of covariate effects, which is necessary for designing precision medicine interventions, for example, without taking the inherent model selection or the presence of the unmeasured confounders into account. To overcome these difﬁculties, a systematic de- velopment of inferential methods for functional outcome data obtained from wearable devices will be carried out. There are three speciﬁc aims: 1) Develop metrics for functional outcome data from wearable devices, 2) Develop nonparametric estimation and testing methods for activity proﬁles and a screening method for predictors of activity proﬁles, 3) Implement the methods in an R package and carry out two case studies using accelerometer data. For Aim 1, the approach is to reduce the sensor data to occupation time proﬁles (e.g., as a function of activity level), and formulate the statistical modeling in terms of these proﬁles using survival and functional data analytic meth- ods. This will have a number of advantages, the principal one being that time-dependent confounders become less problematic because the effect of differences in temporal alignment across subjects is mitigated. In addition, survival analysis methods can be applied by viewing the occupation time as a time-to-event outcome indexed by activity level. For Aim 2, nonparametric methods will be used to compare and order occupation time distributions between groups of subjects that are speciﬁed in terms of baseline covariate levels or treatment groups. Further, a new method of post-selection inference based on marginal screening for function-on-scalar regression will be developed to identify and formally test whether covariates are signiﬁcantly associated with activity proﬁles. Aim 3 will develop an R-package implementation, and as a test-bed for the proposed methods they will be applied to two Columbia-based clinical studies: to the study of physical activity in children enrolled in New York City Head Start, and to the study of experimental drugs for the treatment of mitochondrial depletion syndrome. Project Narrative The relevance of the project to public health is that it will develop statistical methods for the physiological eval- uation of patients on the basis of data collected by inexpensive wearable sensors (e.g., accelerometers). By introducing methods for the rigorous comparison of healthcare status among groups of patients observed longi- tudinally over time using such devices, treatment decisions that can beneﬁt targeted populations of patients in terms of continuously-assessed health outcomes will become possible.",Inferential methods for functional data from wearable devices,9924432,R01AG062401,"['Acceleration ', ' Beds ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Preschool Child ', ' 1-5 years old ', ' preschool child (1-5) ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Drug Combinations ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' indexing ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Methods ', ' Mitochondria ', ' mitochondrial ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Motivation ', ' New York City ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulentia ', ' obese ', ' obese people ', ' obese person ', ' obese population ', ' Occupations ', ' Jobs ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Stochastic Processes ', ' stochastic method ', ' Survival Analysis ', ' Survival Analyses ', ' Syndrome ', ' Target Populations ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' case report ', ' Case Study ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Evaluation ', ' Physical activity ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Event ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' Head Start ', ' Head Start Program ', ' Proxy ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Bypass ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' Data ', ' dietary pattern ', ' Dietary Practices ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' time use ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Outcome ', ' patient population ', ' Regimen ', ' screening ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' precision medicine ', ' treatment group ', ' Data Analytics ', ' accelerometry ', ' activity monitor ', ' activity tracker ', ' Accelerometer ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' lower income families ', ' body sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' wearable sensor ', ' wearable system ', ' wireless sensor technology ', ' wearable sensor technology ', ' wearable electronics ', ' wearable technology ', ' wearable device ', ' circadian ', ' ']",NIA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,298890,NY-13,0.010563908184539885
"Dense Life-log Health Analytics from Wearable Sensors using Functional Analysis and Riemannian Geometry Project Summary The growth and acceptance of wearable devices (e.g., accelerometers) and personal technologies (e.g., smartphones), coupled with larger storage capacities, waterproofing, and more unobtrusive wear locations, has made long-term monitoring of behaviors throughout the 24-hour spectrum more feasible. Wearable devices relevant for human activity (e.g., GENEActiv accelerometer) contain several complementary sensors (accelerometers, gyro, heart- rate monitor etc.) and sample at high rates (e.g., 100Hz for accelerometer). These high-sampling rates and the long duration of capture result in life-log data that truly qualifies as multimodal and big time-series data. The challenges and opportunities involved in fully harvesting these types of data, for widely applicable interventions, suggest that an interdisciplinary approach spanning mathematical sciences, signal processing, and health is needed. Our innovation includes the use of functional-data analysis tools to represent and process the dense time-series data. Functional data analysis is then integrated into machine learning and pattern discovery algorithms for activity classification, prediction of attributes, and discovery of new activity classes. We anticipate that the proposed framework will lead to new insights about human activity and its impact on health outcomes. This interdisciplinary project builds on several research activities of the team. Our past work includes: a) new mathematical developments for computing statistics on time-series data viewed as elements of a function-spaces, b) algorithms for activity recognition that integrate the function-space techniques, and c) data from long-term observational studies of human activity from multimodal sensors. The new work we propose addresses the unique mathematical and computational challenges posed by densely multimodal, long-term, densely-sampled lifelog big-data in a comprehensive framework. The fusion of ideas from human activity modeling, functional-analysis, geometric metrics, and algorithmic machine learning, present unique opportunities for fundamental advancement of the state-of-the-art in objective measurement and quantification of behavioral markers from wearable devices. The proposed approach also brings to fore: a) new mathematical developments of elastic metrics over multi-modal time-series data, b) comparing sequences evolving on different feature manifolds, c) estimation of quasi- periodicities, d) and a new generation of machine-learning and pattern discovery algorithms. The mathematical and algorithmic tools proposed have the potential to significantly advance how wearable data from contemporary devices with high-sampling rates and large storage capabilities are represented, processed, and transformed into accurate inferences about human activity. Wearable devices are becoming more widely adopted in recent years for general health and recreational uses by the broad populace. This research will result in improved algorithms to process the data available from such wearable devices. The long-term goal of the research is to enable personalized home-based physical activity regimens for conditions such as stroke and diabetes.

"Improved AD/ADRD Assessment Sensitivities Using a Novel In-Situ Sensor System Project Summary/Abstract  Accurate assessment of daily functions for individuals at risk for and with AD/ADRD, is fundamental to detection, diagnosis, and characterization of its progression and prescribed treatments. Current assessment techniques typically rely on non- continuous, discreet observations provided from a third party and covering single or limited performance domains. With significantly larger portions of American’s choosing to age in place, any assessment technology must be able to be in-situ (low-cost, ubiquitous) and operate without user interface (autonomous) to provide objective, cross-domain, and continuous daily function measurements and reporting.  The primary objective of this fast track SBIR project is to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of using the Birkeland Current Sovrin IoT system to continuously and accurately assess daily functions, ADLs, and IADLs, for persons experiencing cognitive decline in a home or assisted care settings. This includes direct comparison with an accepted assessment technique, ADCS-ADL/23. Machine learning and artificial intelligent techniques will be employed to identify novel subfactors for improved sensitivities from available sensor data combinations. Secondary objectives include establishing a significant data set of detailed daily actions (<10 sec resolution) for 100+ individuals with AD/ADRD. Long-term goals support future intervention studies through improved assessment tools with enhanced sensitivity to early and mid-stage decline.  The Birkeland Current Sovrin IoT system makes use of patented proximity-based energy monitoring and control sensors, data analytics and change detection algorithms to continuously monitor activities of individuals in a home or assisted care environment. Intelligent power-strips and battery-based sensors located throughout the home or facility, monitor real time absolute location of individuals, caregivers, and devices they interact with. Correlation of high-fidelity data allows accurate determination of activities, attribution to a specific individual, mobility measurement, and behavior assessment across traditional and novel ADL/IADL categories. Birkeland Current is teamed with Texas A&M Center for Population Health and Aging, Georgia, Tech Institute for People and Technology, Baylor Scott and White Division of Gerontology, and multiple home-care and assisted-care facilities, in the development of the study approach, implementation plan, analytics tools, and applications to aging populations and future intervention studies. Project Narrative  The proposed research would utilize novel, ubiquitous Internet-of-Things sensors and automated analytics to demonstrate enhanced sensitivity and future utility of continuous in-situ IADL/ADL data for dementia research and its effectiveness in characterizing interventions for Alzheimer’s and related dementias of aging populations in support of NIA stated priorities.",Improved AD/ADRD Assessment Sensitivities Using a Novel In-Situ Sensor System,10131376,R44AG065118,"['Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Technology ', ' Technology Assessment ', ' Testing ', ' Texas ', ' Time ', ' Use Effectiveness ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' symposium ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Home Care ', ' patient homecare ', ' patient home care ', ' Phase ', ' Series ', ' biogerontology ', ' Gerontology ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' tool ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' In Situ ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' American ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Categories ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Early identification ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Documentation ', ' behavioral assessment ', ' Behavior assessment ', ' Effectiveness ', ' IADL ', ' instrumental activity of daily living ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Resolution ', ' Centers for Population Health ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' Monitor ', ' groupings ', ' Grouping ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' meta data ', ' Metadata ', ' cost ', ' data integration ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' daily functioning ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' analytical tool ', ' data acquisition ', ' aged population ', ' population aging ', ' aging population ', ' data base structure ', ' database structure ', ' Precision care ', ' individualized care ', ' individualized patient care ', ' personalized patient care ', ' personalized care ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Data Analytics ', ' Internet of Things ', ' realtime monitoring ', ' real time monitoring ', ' age in place ', ' aging in place ', ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' learning algorithm ', ' Adoption ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Behavioral Symptoms ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health care facility ', ' Health Facilities ', ' Healthcare Facility ', ' care facilities ', ' Industry ', ' Institutes ', ' Intelligence ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Legal patent ', ' Patents ', ' Patients ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Publishing ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' ']",NIA,BIRKELAND CURRENT LLC,R44,2020,1992588,TX-17,-0.014534202086243984
"Development of a web-based platform implementing novel Predictor of Skin Sensitization for Medical Devices (PreSS/MD) PROJECT SUMMARY Medical devices have been documented to contain toxic chemicals that can leach and cause acute contact dermatitis (ACD) after repeated exposure or prolonged contact of the skin to these toxins. ACD is credited for 10-15% of all occupational illnesses and is also the second highest reported occupational hazard. Given its prevalence, ACD is also a great public health burden with combined yearly costs of up to $1 billion, which spans including medical costs, worker’s compensation and lost working time due to workplace absence. To this end, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has mandated that all medical devices must be evaluated for possible skin sensitization using in vivo animal assays, which includes the Guinea pig maximization test (GPMT). Although GPMT tests provide valuable data on the skin sensitization effects of potential toxins, these assays are time-consuming and expensive. Moreover, the Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Validation of Alternative Methods (ICCVAM) recently published a Strategic Roadmap, calling for the development of alternative approaches to reduce animal testing of chemical and medical agents. Thus, there is a stated need to modernize safety evaluation of medical devices to reduce animal testing and shorten the regulatory review time, which would ultimately bring safer devices to the market faster. To address this unmet need, the key objectives of our FDA Phase I SBIR project are to (i) produce rigorously validated computational models for the GPMT assay integrating data obtained in human, mouse, and in vitro assays; and (ii) integrate these models into a software product termed PreSS/MD (Predictor of Skin Sensitization for Medical Devices). Our specific aims for this study include: 1) collecting, curating, and integrating the largest publicly available dataset for GMPT; 2) creating and validating novel computational models for GMPT data; 3) developing the PreSS/MD web server to allow users to make predictions of skin sensitization potential in medical devices. We will also develop a model for mixtures, including compounds tested jointly in different concentrations, using an approach that we developed previously. Finally, we will implement novel approaches to help users of our PreSS/MD platform interpret the developed models in terms of key chemical features responsible for skin sensitization. In addition, we will employ biomedical knowledge graphs to elucidate Adverse Outcome Pathways (AOPs) for skin sensitizers. Successful execution of this Phase I project will yield in the development of PreSS/MD as a centralized resource to evaluate the skin sensitization potential for medical devices. We expect this software-as-a-service web server platform will be of great value for companies and sponsors seeking regulatory approval of medical devices. PROJECT NARRATIVE Given that medical devices have been documented to contain toxic chemicals that may lead to allergic contact dermatitis, the US Food and Drug Administration requires that all devices be evaluated for possible skin sensitization effects using in vivo assays such as the Guinea pig maximization test. In the effort to modernize skin sensitization safety evaluation methods to reduce in vivo animal testing, herein we propose to develop a software product, PreSS/-MD (Predictor of Skin Sensitization caused by Medical Devices), as an innovative and unique in silico alternative with the potential to better predict human response compared to the existing approaches for skin sensitization assessment. Successful execution of the objectives described in this project will result in a centralized web server platform to evaluate the skin sensitization potential for medical devices, which will be of significant value for companies and sponsors seeking regulatory approval of medical devices.",Development of a web-based platform implementing novel Predictor of Skin Sensitization for Medical Devices (PreSS/MD),10079701,R43ES032371,"['Animals ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Contact Dermatitis ', ' Contact Eczema ', ' Dermatitis Venenata ', ' Economics ', ' Feedback ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' lymph nodes ', ' Lymph Node Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Lymph node proper ', ' Lymphatic nodes ', ' lymph gland ', ' lymphnodes ', ' Medical Device ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Online Systems ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' online computer ', ' web based ', ' Poison ', ' Toxic Chemical ', ' Toxic Substance ', ' toxic compound ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Safety ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Toxin ', ' United States Food and Drug Administration ', ' Food and Drug Administration ', ' USFDA ', "" Workers' Compensation "", ' Workmans Compensation ', "" Workmen's Compensation "", ' Workmens Compensation ', ' Generations ', ' Guinea Pigs ', ' Guinea Pigs Mammals ', ' Cavia ', ' medical costs ', ' Medical Care Costs ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Job Location ', ' Job Place ', ' Job Setting ', ' Job Site ', ' Work Location ', ' Work Place ', ' Work-Site ', ' Worksite ', ' work setting ', ' Workplace ', ' Allergic Eczematous Dermatitis ', ' Allergic Contact Dermatitis ', ' Acute ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Pythons ', ' Chemicals ', ' Chemical Structure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Bayesian Methodology ', ' Bayesian Statistical Method ', ' Bayesian approaches ', ' Bayesian classification method ', ' Bayesian classification procedure ', ' Bayesian posterior distribution ', ' Bayesian Method ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Immunological response ', ' host response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' Immune response ', ' tool ', ' occupational hazard ', ' Knowledge ', ' Reaction ', ' Test Result ', ' Occupational ', ' Prostheses and Implants ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Structure ', ' skin patch ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' QSAR ', ' Quantitiative Structure Activity Relationship ', ' Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship ', ' model development ', ' Skin ', ' Address ', ' Animal Testing ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' International ', ' in vitro Assay ', ' in vivo ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' Validation ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Instruction ', ' cost ', ' Advanced Development ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' Prevalence ', ' chemical release ', ' Consumption ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' ICCVAM ', ' Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Validation of Alternative Methods ', ' Phase I Study ', ' phase 1 study ', ' adverse consequence ', ' adverse outcome ', ' operation ', ' Bayesian adaptive designs ', ' Bayesian adaptive models ', ' Bayesian belief network ', ' Bayesian belief updating model ', ' Bayesian framework ', ' Bayesian hierarchical model ', ' Bayesian network model ', ' Bayesian nonparametric models ', ' Bayesian spatial data model ', ' Bayesian spatial image models ', ' Bayesian spatial models ', ' Bayesian statistical models ', ' Bayesian tracking algorithms ', ' Bayesian Modeling ', ' internet portal ', ' on-line portal ', ' online portal ', ' web-based portal ', ' web portal ', ' systemic toxicity ', ' software as a service ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' web server ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' Computer Models ', ' in silico ', ' graph knowledge base ', ' graph knowledgebase ', ' knowledge graph ', ' ']",NIEHS,"PREDICTIVE, LLC",R43,2020,167910,NC-04,0.003897027592105851
"A Machine Learning-Based Mobile Application and Cloud Platform to Enable Accurate and Streamlined Surveillance of Soil-Transmitted Helminth Infection and Schistosomiasis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections and schistosomiasis affect 2 billion people and have significant detrimental effects on health. Strategies to implement STH and schistosomiasis interventions currently rely on testing for these parasites by microscopic analysis of stool samples to detect parasite eggs and identify egg species. Accurate surveillance testing and timely and accurate reporting of results are required for effective decision-making at the programmatic level to implement infection control strategies. Approaches that increase the speed and standardize the accuracy of microscopy-based testing and streamline reporting could help eliminate STH infections and schistosomiasis. We propose to develop a mobile phone-based STH-schistosome egg identification and counting tool that employs machine learning (deep learning) and works in the absence of an internet connection. With this app, users will collect surveillance data for integration into a cloud platform. Surveillance data can then be visualized in dashboards to inform interventions to control disease. Our approach is fundamentally different from other published work that develop machine learning algorithms for STH and schistosomiasis because it will very accurately identify egg types during surveillance activities, and it will be available to users in an app and integrate with cloud storage and reporting. Our interdisciplinary team combines the expertise of global health researchers, product usability testing experts, microscopists, and data scientists. In the R21 phase, we will collect the largest ever microscopy image set of STH and schistosome eggs (> 15 000). We will train an algorithm based on convolutional neural networks that make highly accurate parasite egg classification (species identification) and embed this algorithm into a mobile app that works without internet connectivity. To promote app utility, we will evaluate its accuracy and usability in a surveillance setting. We established the feasibility of our approach in preliminary data by building a web app that serves the results of a deep learning model that identifies STH and schistosome eggs with > 98% accuracy. The R33 phase will be only undertaken if well-defined milestones are achieved. We will further develop the mobile app as a data capture system that will integrate with cloud storage and a dynamic data visualization system to enable increased accuracy in STH and schistosomiasis surveillance over time and across geographic location. ​Validation studies will assess the​ benefits of the system to time and cost savings and quality of data collected during surveillance activities. The overall goal of this work is to increase the accuracy and streamline STH and schistosomiasis surveillance to enable effective decision-making in disease control.

"Towards a comprehensive multiscale 3D human interactome network PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Almost all proteins function through interacting with other proteins. On average, a protein interacts with ~5 other protein partners in the current human interactome. Therefore, it is of great importance to accurately determine the interface of each interaction, in order to understand how each protein works with different partners to carry out different functions. In our previous Nature Biotechnology study, we implemented a proteome-scale homology modeling approach to generate the first 3D human structural interactome: the interface for each interaction in this network was determined at atomic resolution through co-crystal structures and homology models. Using our 3D interactome, we found that, among >1,800 known disease genes associated with two or more clinically distinctly disorders, pairs of mutations on the same gene but in different interfaces with different partners are significantly more likely to cause distinct diseases. However, only 4,150 human protein interactions have co-crystal structures and 2,921 have high-quality homology models. ~50,000 interactions (87% of the current human interactome) are not amenable to current structural modeling methods. Here, we propose to develop a big-data-driven machine-learning approach integrating biophysiochemical, evolutionary, structural, and population genetic features to identify interaction- specific interfaces for the whole human interactome. Because several key features are unavailable for many proteins and interactions, we propose an innovative approach to use an ensemble of random forest classifiers, named Ensemble Protein Interface Classifier (EPIC), to address this large-scale non-random missing data problem (Aim 1). The high throughput of our massively parallel Clone-seq and INtegrated PrOtein INteractome perTurbation screening (InPOINT) pipeline! uniquely enables us to perform real-time experimental parameter optimization (in Years 2-4 we will clone ~1,500 mutations and examine their impact on ~2,500 interactions every year to iteratively evaluate and refine EPIC; Aim 2). Finally, we will construct a comprehensive multiscale 3D interactome for all known human protein-protein interactions: we will collect/generate atomic- resolution structural models for interactions whenever possible (co-crystal structures and homology models); we will accurately determine interaction-specific interface residues and domains for the whole human interactome. We will deploy an interactive web portal to disseminate our results and allow functional genomic inference in the context of our structural interactome (Aim 3). Our comprehensive multiscale 3D human interactome and the accompanying web portal will greatly reduce the barrier-to-entry for performing systematic structural analysis on a large number of proteins and their interactions, and open the flood gates for such analyses in genomic studies. NARRATIVE Almost all proteins function through interacting with other proteins and the structural details of these interaction interfaces are key in understanding protein function. However, the interfaces for vast majority of human protein interactions are currently unknown. Here, we propose to establish an innovative ensemble classifier approach and implement an unprecedented large-scale computational-experimental iterative learning scheme to predict interfaces for the whole human interactome, in anticipation that our predicted interfaces will help dissect functional sites of disease mutations and be useful for rational drug design to target these sites.",Towards a comprehensive multiscale 3D human interactome network,9963288,R01GM124559,"['Biotechnology ', ' Biotech ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Crystallization ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Drug Design ', ' Evolution ', ' Floods ', ' Flooding ', ' Genes ', ' Population Genetics ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Study models ', ' Structural Models ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Names ', ' Proteins ', ' Publishing ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Individual ', ' Letters ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Missense Mutation ', ' Structure ', ' Graph ', ' Proteome ', ' Modeling ', ' protein protein interaction ', ' functional genomics ', ' Genomics ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Homology Modeling ', ' Resolution ', ' Scheme ', ' Molecular ', ' Docking ', ' protein function ', ' 3-D structure ', ' 3-dimensional structure ', ' 3D structure ', ' three dimensional structure ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' biological research ', ' user-friendly ', ' web-accessible ', ' screening ', ' BigData ', ' Big Data ', ' internet portal ', ' on-line portal ', ' online portal ', ' web-based portal ', ' web portal ', ' human interactome ', ' random forest ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NIGMS,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,384165,NY-23,-0.04177698725547273
"Multiscale models of fibrous interface mechanics PROJECT SUMMARY Interfaces between tissues either transfer load (requiring toughness) or provide a smooth surface (requiring low friction). Fibrous interfaces are very effective at transferring load between tissues, e.g., at connective tissue-bone interfaces (“entheses”), peritoneal-mesentery interfaces, interfaces between layers of the vasculature, and the pia mater. These interfaces require toughness to resist high stresses associated with material mismatches. Surgical repair can lead to smooth interfaces becoming fibrous, (e.g., following hernia surgery) or to tough interfaces becoming weak (e.g., following tendon- and ligament-to-bone repair). In older patients with large rotator cuff repairs, for example, where the desired attachment is not reformed, up to 94% of surgical repairs fail. These challenges arise in part because the features that endow fibrous interfaces with toughness are not known. We therefore propose to develop a comprehensive modeling and experimental approach for studying the factors underlying the transition from tough to weak in a fibrous interface. Our previous work motivates the hypothesis that disorder is a key toughening feature of fibrous attachments. We will focus initially on the example of tendon attaching to bone, in which microscale disorder underlies the ordered macroscale, graded transition between the two tissues, as a foundation for studying the general problem of adhesion throughout the body. We predict that disorder enhances energy absorption by distributing failure processes and energy absorption over larger volumes of tissue. We propose this as a fundamental mechanism by which fibrous interfaces in the body transfer load effectively. We will test these ideas through two aims: (1) Identify and model the mechanisms of fibrous attachment toughening ex vivo. We will model and experimentally validate how disorder across length scales toughens the tendon-to-bone attachment. Hierarchical molecular dynamics-to- continuum models, enriched by machine learning, will be validated in vitro, in systems with nanoscale control of mineral distributions, and ex vivo, in tissue samples of fibrous attachments. (2) Identify and model the loss of fibrous attachment toughness due to pathologic settings in vivo using murine rotator cuff tendinopathy models. In both aims, nano- through milli-scale characterization will be performed to define the mechanisms driving mechanical behavior. We will test the hypothesis that pathology- induced changes at multiple length scales will predict changes in failure mode. These models and experiments will test the global hypothesis that energy absorption across hierarchies is a fundamental toughening mechanism by which fibrous interfaces resist injury level loads. Taken together, we believe that these new models of fibrous attachment will enable an understanding of how the order and complexity of fibrous attachments leads to effective attachment of tissues. PROJECT NARRATIVE Tough fibrous interfaces between tissues are a common location of injury and source of pathology, pain and disability. Surgical repairs of interfaces that are desirable proceed in the absence of knowledge of the mechanisms that endow fibrous interfaces with toughness, and unsurprisingly have very high failure rates of up to a nearly unbelievable 94%. By developing and testing the first mathematical models for the toughness of this class of interfaces, we hope to identify the mechanisms of toughening definitively, and more broadly to provide technology that enables design of improved surgical procedures.",Multiscale models of fibrous interface mechanics,10037326,R01AR077793,"['absorption ', ' Adhesions ', ' Adhesives ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Behavior ', ' bone ', ' Bone Regeneration ', ' bone repair ', ' regenerate bone ', ' Botulinum Toxin Type A ', ' Botulinum A Toxin ', ' Botulinum Neurotoxin A ', ' Clostridium Botulinum Toxin Type A ', ' Clostridium botulinum A Toxin ', ' botulinum toxin A ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Collagen ', ' Collagen Diseases ', ' collagen disorder ', ' collagenopathy ', ' Connective Tissue ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Foundations ', ' Hernia ', ' In Vitro ', ' Laparotomy ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Ligaments ', ' Mesentery ', ' Mesenteric ', ' Minerals ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Nervous system structure ', ' Nervous System ', ' Neurologic Body System ', ' Neurologic Organ System ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Pia Mater ', ' Running ', ' cranium ', ' Skull ', ' Stress ', ' Technology ', ' Tendon structure ', ' Tendons ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Work ', ' Rotator Cuff ', ' Friction ', ' injuries ', ' Injury ', ' cross-link ', ' crosslink ', ' improved ', ' Surface ', ' repair ', ' repaired ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Meniscus ', ' Meniscus structure of joint ', ' Collagen Fiber ', ' Fiber ', ' disability ', ' Failure ', ' Nature ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Bone Tissue ', ' millimeter ', ' Peritoneal ', ' Slide ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Musculoskeletal ', ' Palsy ', ' Plegia ', ' paralysis ', ' paralytic ', ' Paralysed ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Molecular Dynamics Simulation ', ' molecular dynamics ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' Structure ', ' Modeling ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematic model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematical model ', ' Skin ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' Length ', ' Intra-abdominal ', ' in vivo ', ' Pathologic ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' nano ', ' Tendinitis ', ' Tendonitis ', ' Tendinopathy ', ' multiscale modeling ', ' multi-scale modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' nano meter scale ', ' nano meter sized ', ' nano scale ', ' nanometer scale ', ' nanometer sized ', ' nanoscale ', ' nano crystal ', ' nanocrystal ', ' elderly patient ', ' older patient ', ' mechanical behavior ', ' treadmill ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' ']",NIAMS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,545403,MO-01,-0.003534169587124911
"BehaviorSight: Privacy enhancing wearable system to detect health risk behaviors in real-time. Project Summary/Abstract Health-risk behaviors, such as overeating, smoking, consuming alcohol, and not adhering to medication, are responsible for increases in morbidity and mortality. To track and intervene during these health-risk behaviors, clinicians traditionally rely on self-reports. However, self-reports are inaccurate and biased. Therefore, we cannot use self-reports to validate health-risk behaviors in free-living conditions. Thus, an automated technique for validating health-risk behaviors is extremely necessary. With the growth and popularity of wearable devices (e.g., smartwatches), automatic monitoring of physical activity is possible. However, the devices often do not provide any visual confirmation, making it challenging to verify activities performed in free-living conditions. Cameras can capture point-of-view videos and can thus be used as a wearable device to capture videos for visual confirmation of activities, including health-risk behaviors. Such recordings can help us better understand health-risk behaviors. Additionally, video information can be automatically processed to confirm and validate health-risk behaviors. Recording videos of sensitive content and bystanders is associated with privacy and ethical concerns. Currently there is no privacy-preserving camera that can automatically detect health-risk behaviors, and most people are unwilling to wear cameras without raising privacy concerns. In addition to privacy concerns, people prefer wearables that are unobtrusive and small and that do not require frequent charging. Thus, a privacy-preserving, unobtrusive wearable camera would increase wearability. Infrared (IR) sensor arrays have the potential to provide independent temperature readings, which allows determining whether an object is near or far. The IR sensor array can help record only the wearer and objects near the wearer, while filtering out distant objects. IR sensor arrays have a small power footprint, thus providing longer battery life. Our project aims to develop a privacy-conscious, unobtrusive, wearable, behavior-detection platform that will make it possible to detect and intervene upon health-risk behaviors in real time. In this project, we will (1) develop the wearable behavior-detection device that allows visual confirmation without burdening the wearer. The device will augment RGB camera data with IR sensor array data for privacy-conscious recording and automatic behavior detection. (2) We will test various designs to determine a user's acceptability to wear the device. Then, we will test various image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to determine the best algorithm for detecting health-risk behaviors. (3) We will incorporate the best-performing behavior-detection algorithm so that it can run on the developed wearable device. With a behavior-detection algorithm running on an acceptable wearable device, the ability to detect health-risk behaviors in real time will become a reality. Ultimately, our wearable device will allow researchers to test and apply appropriate behavioral interventions in real time, rather than relying on self-reports, whenever health-risk behaviors occur. Project Narrative Several activities involving hand-to-mouth gestures (e.g., overeating, smoking, consuming alcohol, or non- adherence to medication) are associated with health-risk behaviors that are a leading cause of preventable deaths. Being able to automatically monitor health-risk behaviors using wearable video cameras will improve our understanding of these behaviors and will ultimately enable us to design effective methods to intervene when they occur. We will develop BehaviorSight, a privacy-conscious, unobtrusive, wearable, behavior-detection device that will allow future researchers and behavioral scientists to use the device for monitoring numerous everyday health-risk behaviors in free-living settings.",BehaviorSight: Privacy enhancing wearable system to detect health risk behaviors in real-time.,10043674,R21EB030305,"['Alcohol consumption ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' EtOH use ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol use ', ' Algorithms ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Charge ', ' Communication ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Future ', ' Gestures ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Hand ', ' Health ', ' Hyperphagia ', ' Overeating ', ' polyphagia ', ' Learning ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulentia ', ' obese ', ' obese people ', ' obese person ', ' obese population ', ' Reading ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Running ', ' Science ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Technology ', ' Temperature ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Video Recording ', ' Videorecording ', ' video recording system ', ' Privacy ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' image processing ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' Physical activity ', ' Buccal Cavity ', ' Buccal Cavity Head and Neck ', ' Cavitas Oris ', ' Mouth ', ' Oral cavity ', ' Consciousness ', ' Conscious ', ' Visual ', ' lightweight ', ' light weight ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Dietitian ', ' Scientist ', ' Notification ', ' Distant ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' monitoring device ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Laboratory Study ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' drinking ', ' Devices ', ' abuse of substances ', ' substance abuse ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' Thorace ', ' Thoracic ', ' Thorax ', ' Chest ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' miniaturize ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' behavioral monitoring ', ' Behavior monitoring ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' willingness ', ' multi-modality ', ' multimodality ', ' Bluetooth ', ' smartwatch ', ' smart watch ', ' body sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' wearable sensor ', ' wearable system ', ' wireless sensor technology ', ' wearable sensor technology ', ' wearable electronics ', ' wearable technology ', ' wearable device ', ' preventable mortality ', ' preventable death ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' medication non-adherence ', ' medication nonadherence ', ' privacy preservation ', ' data privacy ', ' ']",NIBIB,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R21,2020,606713,IL-07,0.018926037695833963
"Using Retrospective and Real-Time Physical Activity Tracking to Predict Risk of Sunburn in Outdoor Exercisers on Strava Skin cancer is the most common cancer in the United States. Over 5.4 million cases of keratinocyte cancers (basal and squamous cell) are diagnosed annually and incidence of melanoma has increased 3% each year for the past 30 years. In the 2014 Call to Action to Prevent Skin Cancer, the U. S. Surgeon General included strategies for coordinating messages on sun safety and physical activity, recognizing the need for sun safety among populations that engage in physical activity outdoors. Recreational UV exposure is associated with every form of skin cancer; individuals who engage in more physical activity have a higher prevalence of sunburn. Melanoma is the only cancer with which physical activity is positively correlated. Strava, a tracking app and social networking site for athletes, is one of the most popular of mobile technologies for logging physical activity and providing social feedback on activities by other Strava users. The goal of this R21 research is to test the feasibility of interfacing with the Strava website and its mobile app to develop an algorithm that a) predicts when individuals are likely to be engaged in physical activity outdoors in the sun when ultraviolet radiation is high and b) delivers sun safety advice tailored to the time, location, and personal risk (e.g., skin sun sensitivity) of the Strava users. Concept focus groups with Strava users (n=16) and non-users (n=16) will provide input on the feasibility, content, and functions in the Strava Sun (SS) intervention. The algorithm that predicts future outdoor exercise will be developed using machine learning modeling on activity data provided by Strava users (n=1000). The SS intervention will be programmed to deliver ecologically-valid sun safety advice through Strava's open-source Applications Programming Interface (API) via email and comments in the Strava interface. The sun safety advice will be tailored to location, time, season and user's personal risk, employing advice algorithms we developed for a sun safety mobile app, sunZapp, and a social media message library in our Go Sun Smart intervention for outdoor recreation resorts. SS will be tested for usability (n=30 Strava users) prior to conducting a pilot field trial to establish feasibility of SS in practice (n=226 Strava users). The project is significant and innovative. A sun protection interface for the Strava platform will provide individuals who engage in regular physical activity personalized, ecologically-valid advice to help them practice sun safety during outdoor activities. It will contain a novel machine learning algorithm that predicts future high-risk behavior, i.e., outdoor physical activity, to provide precision prevention advice. The intervention will be delivered over an established and popular technology platform with over 42 million registered users. Recreational UV exposure is associated with every form of skin cancer and individuals who engage in more physical activity have a higher prevalence of sunburn, a proximal biomarker of melanoma risk, perhaps explaining why melanoma is the only cancer with which physical activity is positively correlated. Mobile technology for tracking physical activity has become increasingly prevalent and Strava, an activity tracking app and social networking site for athletes, is one of the most popular of these technologies. This research will test the feasibility of delivering location-based, ecologically-valid sun safety advice to Strava users at times when they are predicted to be engaged in outdoor physical activity, by utilizing Strava's public open-source Applications Programming Interface.",Using Retrospective and Real-Time Physical Activity Tracking to Predict Risk of Sunburn in Outdoor Exercisers on Strava,10057198,R21CA241637,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Algorithms ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Skin Cancer ', ' Malignant Skin Neoplasm ', ' malignant skin tumor ', ' Colorado ', ' Connecticut ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diffusion of Innovation ', ' Electronic Mail ', ' E-Mail ', ' Email ', ' electronic communication ', ' Exercise ', ' Feedback ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Incidence ', ' keratinocyte ', ' Libraries ', ' melanoma ', ' Malignant Melanoma ', ' Persuasive Communication ', ' Persuasion ', ' Protective Clothing ', ' Recreation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resort ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Seasons ', ' Software Engineering ', ' Computer Software Development ', ' Computer Software Engineering ', ' Sunburn ', ' Sunscreening Agents ', ' Sunblock ', ' Sunscreens ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Ultraviolet Rays ', ' Actinic Rays ', ' UV light ', ' UV radiation ', ' ultraviolet light ', ' ultraviolet radiation ', ' United States ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Physical activity ', ' Squamous Cell ', ' Individual ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Funding ', ' Prevent skin cancer ', ' skin cancer prevention ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Comment ', ' Commentary ', ' Editorial Comment ', ' Viewpoint ', ' Published Comment ', ' Photosensitiveness due to sun ', ' sun sensitivity ', ' Photosensitivity ', ' sun ', ' The Sun ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Research Priority ', ' programs ', ' Location ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' Surgeon ', ' American ', ' Basal Cell ', ' experience ', ' parallel processing ', ' forgetting ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' novel ', ' graduate student ', ' high risk behavior ', ' Prevention ', ' Devices ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' cancer therapy ', ' Skin ', ' Health system ', ' solar exposure ', ' sunlight exposure ', ' Sun Exposure ', ' Consent ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' NCI Organization ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Exposure to ultraviolet radiation ', ' UV exposure ', ' Ultraviolet Radiation Related Exposure ', ' Ultraviolet radiation exposure ', ' ultraviolet exposure ', ' UV Radiation Exposure ', ' sun protection ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' willingness ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' skill development ', ' skill acquisition ', ' safety practice ', ' open source ', ' usability ', ' social learning theory ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' prototype ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' on-line social networking ', ' online social networking ', ' social networking site ', ' social networking web site ', ' web-based social networking ', ' social networking website ', ' data format ', ' Randomization trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' mobile app ', ' mobile application ', ' personalized prevention ', ' precision prevention ', ' individualized prevention ', ' sun safety ', ' application program interface ', ' application programming interface ', ' social media ', ' mobile platform ', ' mobile technology ', ' mobile computing ', ' accelerometry ', ' activity monitor ', ' activity tracker ', ' Accelerometer ', ' fitbit ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' data access ', ' biomarker of triple-negative melanoma ', ' melanoma associated biomarker ', ' melanoma biomarkers ', ' high risk group ', ' high risk population ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' financial burden ', ' financial distress ', ' financial strain ', ' financial stress ', ' Financial Hardship ', ' ']",NCI,"KLEIN BUENDEL, INC.",R21,2020,444313,CO-07,0.00044687065550167793
"Graphene-based Nanosensor Device for Rapid, Onsite Detection of Total Lead in Tap Water PROJECT SUMMARY Detrimental health impacts of lead are largely attributed to long-term exposures to undetected lead, which are particularly troublesome and problematic because of the neurological damage to children, a situation that should not be tolerated by an advanced society like the U.S. The Flint Water Crisis and many other water catastrophes could have been avoided if early warning can be made possible through timely detection of lead in drinking water at the point of use. Our extensive customer interviews unambiguously suggest that current options for lead detection are unsatisfactory for on-site testing, as they represent two extremes: one being accurate but expensive, slow, and hard to use; and the other being low-cost, fast, and easy to use but inaccurate. NanoAffix Science LLC (NAFX) proposes to address the above unmet need and niche market product gap by empowering water users (particularly those in economically disadvantaged communities) and water service providers with a low-cost, easy-to-use, and accurate handheld tester for rapid detection of total lead in the tap water, right from the kitchen sink. The handheld lead tester combines a novel proprietary micro-sized sensor chip embedded in a proprietary test cell with a portable digital meter for direct readout of testing results. The Phase I project has successfully established the feasibility for detection of soluble lead in the tap water using an earlier version of the prototype handheld tester. The Phase II project will continue to develop the handheld tester toward total lead detection, better device uniformity, pilot scale-up manufacturing, and accurate calibration. At the end of the Phase II project, NAFX plans to produce 20 beta units of the handheld lead tester meeting all performance specifications for field validation by 10 initial customers (e.g., schools/daycares, end water users, and well water drillers). Major innovations of the proposed approach include accurate prediction of the particulate lead through partial digestion based on lead digestion kinetics, and strategic and synergistic improvement of the ultimate sensor prediction accuracy by (1) improving the physical sensor device uniformity (both intra-wafer and inter-wafer) through innovative device configuration and rigorous quality control; and (2) improving the calibration accuracy through innovative theoretical equilibrium chemistry modeling and machine learning data analytics. The NAFX handheld lead tester is the first of its kind to (1) offer all three features sought by customers: accurate, cheap, and fast; and (2) to simultaneously report all three types of lead: total lead (indicative of overall toxicity), soluble lead (indicative of slow leaching of lead), and particulate lead (indicative of sporadic flaking of lead), which thus can not only alert customers to the lead hazard in their drinking water but also enable customers to identify possible causes and most effective solutions to mitigate the lead contamination. Therefore, the project will result in not only considerable economic impact but also immense societal impact. The regular use of NAFX handheld tester - even if intermittently - will virtually eliminate the chance of chronic exposure to undetected lead, thereby accruing significant and predictable public health impact, especially in locations with the highest risk. PROJECT NARRATIVE The NanoAffix Phase II project aims to continue the development of a handheld lead tester for accurate and low- cost onsite detection of total lead in tap water by untrained users, based on the success of the Phase I project. The project will contribute to enhancing the public health by offering an accessible tool for quantitative monitoring of all three types of lead: total lead (indicative of overall toxicity), soluble lead (indicative of slow leaching of lead), and particulate lead (indicative of sporadic flaking of lead) in tap water. The regular use of NanoAffix handheld tester - even if intermittently - will virtually eliminate the chance of chronic exposure to undetected lead, thereby accruing significant and predictable public health impact, especially in locations with the highest risk.","Graphene-based Nanosensor Device for Rapid, Onsite Detection of Total Lead in Tap Water",10024064,R44ES028656,"['Algorithms ', ' Calibration ', ' Cations ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chemistry ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Digestion ', ' Disinfection ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Equipment ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' Interview ', ' Kinetics ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Lead Poisoning ', ' Pb lead toxicity ', ' Pb poisoning ', ' Pb toxic effect ', ' Pb toxicity ', ' Pb2+ Toxicity ', ' Pb2+ lead toxicity ', ' Pb2+ poisoning ', ' Pb2+ toxic effect ', ' lead poisonings ', ' lead toxic effect ', ' lead toxicity ', ' toxic effect to lead ', ' toxicity to lead ', ' Michigan ', ' Paper ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality Control ', ' Research ', ' Schools ', ' Science ', ' Societies ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Water ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Water Supply ', ' Specialist ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' specimen collection ', ' sample collection ', ' Site ', ' Chronic ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Training ', ' Measurement ', ' Exposure to ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Contracts ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Test Result ', ' Particulate ', ' meter ', ' meetings ', ' empowered ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' water quality ', ' hazard ', ' drinking water ', ' aqueous ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' novel ', ' economic impact ', ' Economically Deprived ', ' economic disadvantage ', ' economically disadvantaged ', ' underclass ', ' Economically Deprived Population ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Nervous System Injuries ', ' Nervous System damage ', ' Neurological Damage ', ' Neurological Injury ', ' Neurological trauma ', ' neurotrauma ', ' Nervous System Trauma ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' portability ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' International ', ' Validation ', ' wireless ', ' Wireless Technology ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cost ', ' virtual ', ' digital ', ' rapid detection ', ' Pb concentration ', ' lead concentration ', ' Pb contaminated ', ' Pb contamination ', ' Pb2+ contaminated ', ' Pb2+ contamination ', ' contaminated to lead ', ' contamination to lead ', ' lead contaminated ', ' lead contamination ', ' nano sensing ', ' nano sensors ', ' nanosensing ', ' nanosensors ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' prototype ', ' high risk ', ' manufacturing scale-up ', ' operation ', ' Data Analytics ', ' graphene ', ' service providers ', ' realtime monitoring ', ' real time monitoring ', ' well water ', ' ']",NIEHS,"NANOAFFIX SCIENCE, LLC",R44,2020,719088,WI-04,0.021136458533207825
"Novel use of mHealth data to identify states of vulnerability and receptivity to JITAIs Abstract: Smoking cessation decreases morbidity and mortality and is a cornerstone of cancer prevention. The ability to impact current and future vulnerability (e.g., high risk for a lapse) in real-time via engagement in self-regulatory activities (e.g., behavioral substitution, mindful attention) is considered an important pathway to quitting success. However, poor engagement represents a major barrier to maximizing the impact of self- regulatory activities. Hence, enhancing real-time, real-world engagement in evidence-based self-regulatory activities has the potential to improve the effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions. Just-In-Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) delivered via mobile devices have been developed for preventing and treating addictions. JITAIs adapt over time to an individual’s changing status and are optimized to provide appropriate intervention strategies based on real time, real world context. Organizing frameworks on JITAIs emphasize minimizing disruptions to the daily lives and routines of the individual, by tailoring strategies not only to vulnerability, but also to receptivity (i.e., an individual’s ability and willingness to utilize a particular intervention). Although both vulnerability and receptivity are considered latent states that are dynamically and constantly changing based on the constellation and temporal dynamics of emotions, context, and other factors, no attempt has been made to systematically investigate the nature of these states, as well as how knowledge of these states can be used to optimize real-time engagement in self-regulatory activities. To close this gap, the proposed project will apply innovative computational approaches to one of the most extensive and racially/ethnically diverse collection of real time, real world data on health behavior change (smoking cessation). Intensive longitudinal self-reported and sensor data from 5 studies (3 completed and 2 ongoing) of ~1,500 smokers attempting to quit will be analyzed with advanced probabilistic latent variable models and machine learning to investigate how the temporal dynamics and interactions of emotions, self-regulatory capacity (SRC), context, and other factors can be used to detect (Aim 1) states of vulnerability to a lapse and (Aim 2) states of receptivity to engaging in self-regulatory activities. We will also investigate (Aim 3) how knowledge of these states can be used to optimize real-time engagement in self-regulatory activities by conducting a Micro-Randomized Trial (MRT) enrolling 150 smokers attempting to quit. Utilizing a mobile smoking cessation app, the MRT will randomize each individual multiple times per day to either (a) no intervention prompt; (b) a prompt recommending engagement in brief (low effort) strategies; or (c) a prompt recommending a more effortful practice of self-regulation strategies. The proposed research will be the first to yield a comprehensive conceptual, technical, and empirical foundation necessary to develop effective JITAIs based on dynamic models of vulnerability and receptivity. Narrative: The current project proposes to advance the field of theory-driven behavior change interventions by investigating the dynamic role of distinct emotions, Self-Regulatory Capacity (SRC) and context in detecting vulnerability to lapse and receptivity to self-regulatory activities in smokers attempting to quit, as well as ascertaining the utility of these states in triggering real- time self-regulatory recommendations.",Novel use of mHealth data to identify states of vulnerability and receptivity to JITAIs,9990732,U01CA229437,"['Attention ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Boredom ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Emotions ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Aphorisms ', ' Maxim ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Play ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Smoking ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Societies ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' Measures ', ' smoking cessation ', ' cease smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' stop smoking ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Smoker ', ' depressed ', ' sadness ', ' Depressed mood ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Location ', ' behavior change ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' success ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Cigarette ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Modeling ', ' craving ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' smoking cessation treatment ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Collection ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' willingness ', ' positive emotion ', ' positive emotional state ', ' coping ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Health behavior change ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' mobile device ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' addictive disorder ', ' addiction ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' mindfulness ', ' Randomization trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' m-Health ', ' mobile health ', ' mHealth ', ' field theory ', ' Learning Skill ', ' Formulation ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' adaptive intervention ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2020,623237,MI-12,0.00876817452773706
