"A Functional Census of p53 Cancer and Suppressor Mutants    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The transcription factor p53 is a central tumor suppressor protein that controls DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis. About half of human cancers have p53 mutations, and restoring p53 function in advanced tumors leads to tumor regression. Significantly, the large majority of these tumors produce full-length p53 proteins that have lost their tumor suppressor function due to single amino acid changes. Therefore, an attractive new approach to systemic cancer therapy is pharmacological reactivation of p53 cancer mutants. Reactivation of p53 cancer mutants is feasible because we and others have shown that introducing additional mutations (second-site suppressor mutations) can restore activity to the otherwise inactive p53 cancer mutants. In addition a few promising small molecule drug leads with unknown mechanisms of action have been reported to reactivate p53 cancer mutants. The challenge is to understand structural changes that lead to reactivation of p53 cancer mutants and to induce such changes through small molecules. This is a complex problem due to the diversity of clinically relevant single amino acid changes found in p53 cancer mutants.  We propose computational approaches based on machine learning that are supported by high-throughput biological strategies. We use novel saturation mutagenesis approaches to catalogue p53 rescue mutations for the 50 most relevant p53 mutants found in human cancer. The genetic data are used in an active learning scheme to train a computational classifier, that is based on modeled atom-level structural features, to predict which structural changes lead to reactivation of any given p53 cancer mutant. We further propose to apply this improved computational classifier to discover small molecules that induce similar structural changes and test these pre-selected compounds in a biological assay for p53 cancer mutant reactivation. Data obtained from these in vivo experiments will be used to further improve the computational predictions for small molecules.  In summary, we use genetic functional data to train a structure-based classifier to predict p53 activity based on an internal representation of modeled structural changes. The classifier will then be used to predict reactivation of p53 cancer mutants by small molecules with the aim to identify cancer drug leads. The proposed research has high impact on biomedical research and public health. About 250,000 US deaths yearly are due to tumors with full length but mutated and inactive p53. The long-term goal of this research, a drug that reactivates mutant p53, could prevent or delay these deaths.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The tumor suppressor protein p53 is the single most important protein to prevent cancer, and half of all human tumors produce a defective p53 protein. Pharmacological reactivation of the defective p53 proteins could potentially prevent or delay over 250,000 cancer deaths yearly in the US alone. This proposal uses genetic strategies and computational approaches to predict p53 reactivation by small molecules that can eventually develop into cancer drugs.                        The tumor suppressor protein p53 is the single most important protein to prevent cancer, and half of all human tumors produce a defective p53 protein.

"Feedback, lineages and cancer: A multidisciplinary approach.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer is a disorder of unrestrained cell proliferation, but increasingly it seems that not all proliferating cells in a tumor matter equally. As with cells in normal tissues, tumor cells appear to progress through lineage stages, in which the capacity for unlimited self-renewal is, at some point, lost. The cancer stem cell hypothesis states that cancer diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic efforts need to be focused on that population of cells-often a small minority-that undergoes long-term self-renewal. While this hypothesis acknowledges the existence of lineage progression in cancers, it is silent on the function that lineages normally serve. We recently found, through experimental and theoretical work, that a likely raison-d'etre for lineages is to provide a framework for powerful feedback control of growth and regeneration, through mechanisms that target the differentiation decisions of individual cells. For cancer to develop, such feedback control must be disrupted, and the natural history of most tumors suggests that it becomes disrupted progressively over time. Our studies indicate that what happens in a tissue when feedback is compromised can be very complex, yet still understandable and predictable. We argue, therefore, that from the details of how a tumor develops over time-size, shape, growth rate, stem cell fraction, etc.-one ought to be able to infer specific information about the kinds of control processes that operate (or recently operated) within the tumor and its surrounding environment. Such information can both provide insight into how different types of tumors develop, as well as patient-specific information about prognosis and the effects of therapy. The proposed project focuses on learning how to obtain such information from the observable properties of tumors. Three-dimensional mathematical models that incorporate various types of lineage progression, feedback, evolutionary processes, and therapeutic interventions will first be created, analyzed, and used to generate large numbers of simulations of solid tumor growth and progression. From these results, mappings from tumor properties to feedback and lineage architectures will be found through state-of-the art machine-learning algorithms. The ability of these mappings to reproduce and predict the behaviors of real tumors will be assessed using established animal models of breast cancer, in which luminescent and fluorescent imaging techniques are used to follow tumors, and their stem cells, over time. This will enable the validation of particular model architectures, or suggest methods for their refinement, and allow the determination of control strategies at work in tumors that can be exploited to provide a leap forward in both personalized medicine and cancer care. What makes this project a ""grand opportunity"" is the pursuit of rapid progress through a highly multidisciplinary team that will draw on new advances in the areas of cell lineage behaviors, cancer stem cells, three-dimensional mathematical and computational modeling, and machine-learning.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Tumors arise when the feedback control of cell growth breaks down. We hypothesize that, within the details of how a tumor grows lie important clues about the nature of feedback processes-including those that still remain or may be re-activated. By describing how such clues can be found, we will be defining a new approach for predicting how individual tumors behave in cancer patients, and how they respond to different kinds of therapy.              Tumors arise when the feedback control of cell growth breaks down.

"Statistical atlases of brain tumor MRI:do imaging phenotypes predict progression?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Statistical atlases, and associated image analysis methods, have found widespread use in several neuroimaging fields, presenting a powerful way to integrate diverse imaging information, correlate it with genetic and clinical measurements, understand effects of disease on brain structure and function, and construct diagnostic tools. This proposal will combine statistical image analysis, deformable registration, and biophysical modeling approaches to an integrated framework for constructing and clinically using statistical atlases from brain tumor patients. Emphasis is placed on gliomas, which have very poor prognosis due to cancer infiltration beyond the visible tumor boundary. Accordingly, the ultimate clinical goal of this study is to identify subtle imaging characteristics of brain tissue that is likely to be infiltrated by tumor, as well as of tissue that is likely to present recurrence in relatively shorter time period. This will be achieved by studying the multi-modal imaging phenotypes of healthy and pathologic tissues in conjunction with spatial information, including the spatial pattern of the tumor and the proximity of malignant tissue to white matter fiber pathways, and by correlating these phenotypes with clinical information, including tumor recurrence. The hypothesis is that signal and spatial information together will be able to identify brain tissues that are likely to later present recurrence. The main technical challenges that will be overcome are 1) development of computationally efficient biophysical models of tumor growth, diffusion, and mass effect; 2) development of deformable registration methods that will allow us to co-register tumor-bearing brain images and build a population-based atlas-the main challenges here are to estimate the appropriate tumor parameters as well as the location of peri-tumor anatomy that is typically confounded by edema, infiltration and extreme deformations; and 3) development of machine learning methods for characterizing subtle abnormalities of brain tissue, and for identifying tissue that is likely to present recurrence after resection and treatment. Pilot studies on the feasibility of this approach to larger clinical studies will be performed on a database of brain MR images obtained from glioma patients via a rich and extensive acquisition protocol, including perfusion, diffusion tensor imaging, spectroscopy, and conventional imaging.           ",Statistical atlases of brain tumor MRI:do imaging phenotypes predict progression?,7760605,R01NS042645,"['Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' Diffusion ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' imaging modality ', ' imaging method ', ' Edema ', ' Hydrops ', ' Dropsy ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Preventive ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Data ', ' Proliferating ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Scheme ', ' Pathologic ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Malignant neoplasm of brain ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Brain ', ' Brain Cancer ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' neoplastic ', ' Glioma ', ' neuroglia tumor ', ' neuroglia neoplasm ', ' glial-derived tumor ', ' Neuroglial Tumor ', ' Neuroglial Neoplasm ', ' Glial Tumor ', ' Glial Neoplasm ', ' Glial Cell Tumors ', ' base ', ' tumor progression ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' cancer progression ', ' Goals ', ' Aging ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Image Analysis ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Diffuse ', ' Malignant -

"Algorithmic strategies for detecting structural variation in genomes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fine-scale nucleotide changes, along with genetic recombination, are often cited as the major source of human genetic variation [1, 13, 14]. Less is known about larger scale (> 10kb) genomic structural variations. As genomic technologies improve, we are detecting structural variation in ever-increasing numbers, including genomic inversions [24, 48, 71, 65, 31]; insertion/deletion polymorphisms [12, 26, 42]; and, copy number polymorphisms [28, 59, 60]. These large variations can completely disrupt coding and regulatory sites and copy number of genes, and thereby have a huge impact on human phenotypes and disease susceptibility [23, 61]. Deleterious effects have indeed been observed in cancer and other diseases [70, 43]. Our understanding of the scale and impact of these variations can be enhanced by improving computational tools for mining the data from these technologies. Here, I propose the development of algorithms and computational tools to improve detection and resolution (location of breakpoints) of structural variation. Specifically, I will develop algorithms for (a) experimental design of sequencing projects for detecting and resolving structural variations; (b) fine-mapping of breakpoints using end sequence profiling, to detect gene-disruption and gene-fusions; (c) reconstructing tumor genome architectures; (d) detection of targeted genomic variations in a heterogeneous mix of normal versus mutated cells via multiplex PCR; and (e) detection of balanced structural variation in genotype data. The tools will be designed using techniques from statistical machine learning and combinatorial algorithms. Validation will be performed using known structural variations, simulation studies, and extensive experimental collaborations with technology developers and early technology adopters. All of the data, and software will be freely available for academic and non-commercial uses.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed computational tools will be used to detect structural variations in human populations as a starting point for understanding their role in normal evolution and disease, specifically cancer. The architecture of tumor genomes will help reveal genes that are disrupted and differentially expressed in tumor cells.

"Reliable Human-Model Observers for Emission Tomography    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our overall objective is to develop numerical observers for dependable technology evaluations in emission tomography. Positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission tomography (SPECT) are the primary clinical modalities for imaging many types of cancer. However, early de- tection often presents the best chances of surviving cancer whereas these imaging modalities have limited diagnostic utility for small tumors. Systematic task-based developmental assessments could facilitate early identification of promising new technology for improving the diagnostic capabilities of these modalities. Yet, assessments with human observers are generally impractical for developmental use. Moreover, available mathematical models (or numerical observers) intended to predict human performance-what we refer to as human-model observers-present significant limits, including con- straints on the types of diagnostic tasks that can be considered. Partly because of these constraints, existing human-model observers frequently require revalidation given any change to the imaging pro- cess. Our approach to observer development is founded on the concept of task equivalence, whereby the task for the numerical observer mirrors the desired clinical task as closely as possible. In this grant, we propose a novel observer framework that is influenced by descriptions of radiologists' visual-search (VS) processes, in which an initial global scan of an image identifies candidate locations deserving closer inspection. We shall use the VS paradigm to investigate the hypotheses that task equivalence i) can lead to a human-observer model that reliably generalizes to a wide range of diagnostic tasks, and ii) is necessary to ensure truly relevant task-based evaluations. We shall test these hypotheses through observer studies with fluorine-18 deoxyglucose (FDG) whole-body PET and SPECT In-111 imaging of neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). A state-of-the-art model observer for developmental stud- ies should be capable of detection-localization tasks, and our observer studies will be analyzed with jackknife FROC (JAFROC) methodology. The specific aims of this work are to: 1) determine what features of FDG-PET image slices attract initial human-observer attention; 2) develop a VS numerical observer for tumor detection-localization tasks in FDG-PET; 3) test the VS observer against humans in a JAFROC detection-localization study featuring hybrid PET images; 4) investigate generalizations of the VS observer to SPECT and 3D detection-localization tasks; and 5) compare system optimiza- tions for oncologic SPECT obtained from the VS and existing numerical observers. The application is optimization of a parallel-hole collimator design for In-111 NET imaging.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Functional imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission tomog- raphy (SPECT) has a significant role in cancer diagnosis and management.

"Chip-Based Diagnosis of Problematic Liver Tumors    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Precise tumor diagnosis and classification is the first step in cancer management. While many tumor biopsies are diagnostic and form the cornerstone of cancer therapy, classification of tumor type and site of origin, is an ever-present clinical challenge. It is estimated that up to 10% of all tumors have no defined primary site of origin and that thousands of dollars are spent per case to identify the site of origin with limited overall success. The current standard of pathologic practice, using morphologic criteria and a panel of semi-quantitative immunohistochemical (IHC) analyses, is often limited in its capacity to define tumor type or site of origin. Moreover, the diagnosis of metastatic lesions can be quite difficult when no primary site of origin has been identified (unknown primary cancers). Since therapy is often based on site of origin, there is a clear need for the identification and validation of a classifier that will cleanly distinguish these histologically similar tumor types and augment standard pathological techniques in making the diagnostic call. We have recently demonstrated the feasibility of using gene expression profiling to discriminate 21 different tumor types with an accuracy of 88%. The performance of this classifier, however, was principally limited by the use of multiple platforms for analysis. This proposal seeks to build a new gene expression classifier on a single, commercially available, genome-wide oligonucleotide platform, with a focus on the most problematic primary and metastatic tumors of the liver. To demonstrate the clinical utility of this approach, we plan to validate the classifier with independent test sets that will also be profiled by standard IHC approaches; the results of molecular classification will then be compared head to head with standard pathological classification for accuracy of diagnosis. To further translate the technology, we will select core classifier genes and perform validation with real time quantitative PCR. Finally, the molecular classifiers will be tested using prospectively acquired biopsy samples on tissues of known and unknown sites of origin.           ",Chip-Based Diagnosis of Problematic Liver

"Multiresolution-fractal modeling for brain tumor detection    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The PI's long-term research goal is to develop a fully functional automated robust CAD tool for accurate  pediatric brain tumor volume segmentation and tracking over time. Note the current practice in brain tumor  volume segmentation involves manual tracing and segmentation of suspected tumor areas in multimodality MRI  which is time consuming, labor intensive, and may be imprecise.  In an effort to reduce cognitive sequelae, contemporary protocols employ risk-adapted therapy in which risk  stratification is based on volume of residual tumor after surgical resection and presence of metastatic disease at  diagnosis. Therefore, further improvement in cancer treatment outcome in children is unlikely to be achieved  without improved knowledge of tumor volume and classification among other factors. In addition, such automated  volume computation and tracking tool would be of value as an adjunct marker in following up patients with brain  tumors. This will, in turn, help the physicians to make important patient management decisions about surgery  planning, critical radiation treatment planning modifications, treatment field modifications, localized control, sites  of metastatic disease and post therapy response evaluation.  However, development of such automated and precise tumor volume segmentation CAD tool requires solution to  a few challenges such as detection of hard-to-detect brain tumor (small residual after surgery, poorly  enhanced, multi foci and irregularly shaped) and abnormalities (edema, necrosis, and larger resection  cavity due to surgery) detection and classification. This project aims at development, testing, and evaluation  of innovative techniques and tools that will assist feature-based detection, segmentation and classification of  brain tumor and a few specific abnormalities.} The specific aims of this project are: 1) Spline-multiresolution  wavelet-fractal feature extraction; 2) MR sequence-dependant feature fusion and tumor/abnormality size and  volume determination for improved detection; 3) Optimized feature fusion for improved tumor, tissue and  abnormality classification; and 4) Algorithm testing and validation. {If successful, our method will allow for the  automatic computation of brain tumors and abnormalities with improved accuracy, which can provide a rapid,  objective, reproducible, and easily reported assessment of the disease. The results obtained from this project will  have immediate impact in pediatric neuroradiology practice by providing an accurate, objective, and consistent  way to evaluate and interpret brain tumors and associated abnormalities.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project aims at development, testing, and evaluation of novel feature-based algorithms for robust, accurate  and reproducible brain tumor and other abnormalities detection and classification.

"Genotype and phenotype predictors in therapy response in renal cell carcinoma     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Therapy of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has been transformed in recent years by the efficacy of targeted agents that inhibit kinases involved in critical cellular signaling pathways and VEGF, a primary driver of tumor angiogenesis. However, patient response to these therapeutics is highly variable and currently cannot be predicted based on clinical or pathological data or available laboratory/genetic testing. The goal of this proposal is to develop predictors of therapeutic response for patients with the most common subtype of RCC, clear cell (ccRCC), based on novel tests. Our approach is based primarily on the hypothesis that the targeted agents used in ccRCC therapy - bevacizumab, sunitinib and sorafenib - inhibit tumor vessel activation and that the activation status and stability of tumor vessels are major determinants of response. We also hypothesize that the phenotype of ccRCC tumor vessels is linked to the molecular pathobiology of the tumor cells. In particular, as these drugs also can inhibit tumor cell signaling and modulate their behavior, ccRCC tumor cell signaling, HIF-1/HIF-2 (hypoxia-inducible factor) expression and VHL function are potential determinants of response. To examine parameters of vascular phenotype, tumor cell phenotype and VHL genotype as predictors of response to therapy, ccRCC specimens will undergo multiplex immunostaining for the appropriate biomarker antigens and be analyzed by a novel computer-assisted image analysis system that objectively quantifies analyte staining on a cellular (cytometric) basis as well as by traditional pixel-based analysis. These studies will be performed on tumors of ccRCC patients treated with single-agent bevacizumab, sunitinib or sorafenib in ongoing multi-institutional phase II (ECOG2804) and phase III (ECOG2805) clinical trials, using tumor blocks from a subset of 90, 170 and 170 appropriate ccRCC patients for therapy with the respective drugs. The specific aims of this proposal are (Aim 1) to analyze the vascular and endothelial cell activation phenotype and vessel pericyte coverage in ccRCC tumors; (Aim 2) to analyze tumor cell signaling, HIF phenotype and VHL genotype in ccRCC tumors; and (Aim 3) to correlate parameters quantified in the prior aims for relationships to each other, to therapeutic outcome and to develop parsimonious predictive models of therapeutic response using biostatistical and bioinformatics approaches. The results of these studies should allow identification of the most appropriate drugs for treating individual patients with ccRCC and assist in the rational development of second-line and combination drug therapies. Beyond ccRCC, the targeted agents under study are used in the therapy of an ever expanding number of cancers, and the response predictors developed for ccRCC, where these agents are best studied because they are used as single-agents, may be useful for predicting response of these other cancers to combination therapy incorporating the targeted agents. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Novel targeted cancer therapy agents have shown success in the treatment of kidney cancer (renal cell carcinoma), a cancer that is increasing in incidence and newly diagnosed in over 50,000 Americans a year. Studies in this project will characterize the tumor blood vessel characteristics and genetic defect of renal cell carcinomas and correlate them with therapeutic response to identify factors that can predict whether they will respond to treatment. Discovering features of kidney cancer that predict therapeutic response can then be used to stratify patients to different therapies in the future   and will provide lessons that are likely to be applicable to many other cancers being treated with the same novel drugs.           Novel targeted cancer therapy agents have shown success in the treatment of kidney cancer (renal cell carcinoma), a cancer that is increasing in incidence and newly diagnosed in over 50,000 Americans a year.

"Statistical atlases of brain tumor MRI:do imaging phenotypes predict progression?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Statistical atlases, and associated image analysis methods, have found widespread use in several neuroimaging fields, presenting a powerful way to integrate diverse imaging information, correlate it with genetic and clinical measurements, understand effects of disease on brain structure and function, and construct diagnostic tools. This proposal will combine statistical image analysis, deformable registration, and biophysical modeling approaches to an integrated framework for constructing and clinically using statistical atlases from brain tumor patients. Emphasis is placed on gliomas, which have very poor prognosis due to cancer infiltration beyond the visible tumor boundary. Accordingly, the ultimate clinical goal of this study is to identify subtle imaging characteristics of brain tissue that is likely to be infiltrated by tumor, as well as of tissue that is likely to present recurrence in relatively shorter time period. This will be achieved by studying the multi-modal imaging phenotypes of healthy and pathologic tissues in conjunction with spatial information, including the spatial pattern of the tumor and the proximity of malignant tissue to white matter fiber pathways, and by correlating these phenotypes with clinical information, including tumor recurrence. The hypothesis is that signal and spatial information together will be able to identify brain tissues that are likely to later present recurrence. The main technical challenges that will be overcome are 1) development of computationally efficient biophysical models of tumor growth, diffusion, and mass effect; 2) development of deformable registration methods that will allow us to co-register tumor-bearing brain images and build a population-based atlas-the main challenges here are to estimate the appropriate tumor parameters as well as the location of peri-tumor anatomy that is typically confounded by edema, infiltration and extreme deformations; and 3) development of machine learning methods for characterizing subtle abnormalities of brain tissue, and for identifying tissue that is likely to present recurrence after resection and treatment. Pilot studies on the feasibility of this approach to larger clinical studies will be performed on a database of brain MR images obtained from glioma patients via a rich and extensive acquisition protocol, including perfusion, diffusion tensor imaging, spectroscopy, and conventional imaging.           ",Statistical atlases of brain tumor MRI:do imaging phenotypes predict progression?,8020024,R01NS042645,"['Primary Brain Neoplasms ', ' Primary Brain Tumors ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Edema ', ' Hydrops ', ' Dropsy ', ' Perfusion ', ' Wolves ', ' treatment planning ', ' gray matter ', ' substantia grisea ', ' imaging modality ', ' imaging method ', ' Malignant neoplasm of brain ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Brain ', ' Brain Cancer ', ' mathematical model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' Math Models ', ' Preventive ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Problem Solving ', ' soft tissue ', ' cancer recurrence ', ' Malignant -

"Reliable Human-Model Observers for Emission Tomography    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our overall objective is to develop numerical observers for dependable technology evaluations in emission tomography. Positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission tomography (SPECT) are the primary clinical modalities for imaging many types of cancer. However, early de- tection often presents the best chances of surviving cancer whereas these imaging modalities have limited diagnostic utility for small tumors. Systematic task-based developmental assessments could facilitate early identification of promising new technology for improving the diagnostic capabilities of these modalities. Yet, assessments with human observers are generally impractical for developmental use. Moreover, available mathematical models (or numerical observers) intended to predict human performance-what we refer to as human-model observers-present significant limits, including con- straints on the types of diagnostic tasks that can be considered. Partly because of these constraints, existing human-model observers frequently require revalidation given any change to the imaging pro- cess. Our approach to observer development is founded on the concept of task equivalence, whereby the task for the numerical observer mirrors the desired clinical task as closely as possible. In this grant, we propose a novel observer framework that is influenced by descriptions of radiologists' visual-search (VS) processes, in which an initial global scan of an image identifies candidate locations deserving closer inspection. We shall use the VS paradigm to investigate the hypotheses that task equivalence i) can lead to a human-observer model that reliably generalizes to a wide range of diagnostic tasks, and ii) is necessary to ensure truly relevant task-based evaluations. We shall test these hypotheses through observer studies with fluorine-18 deoxyglucose (FDG) whole-body PET and SPECT In-111 imaging of neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). A state-of-the-art model observer for developmental stud- ies should be capable of detection-localization tasks, and our observer studies will be analyzed with jackknife FROC (JAFROC) methodology. The specific aims of this work are to: 1) determine what features of FDG-PET image slices attract initial human-observer attention; 2) develop a VS numerical observer for tumor detection-localization tasks in FDG-PET; 3) test the VS observer against humans in a JAFROC detection-localization study featuring hybrid PET images; 4) investigate generalizations of the VS observer to SPECT and 3D detection-localization tasks; and 5) compare system optimiza- tions for oncologic SPECT obtained from the VS and existing numerical observers. The application is optimization of a parallel-hole collimator design for In-111 NET imaging.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Functional imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission tomog- raphy (SPECT) has a significant role in cancer diagnosis and management.

"Algorithmic strategies for detecting structural variation in genomes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fine-scale nucleotide changes, along with genetic recombination, are often cited as the major source of human genetic variation [1, 13, 14]. Less is known about larger scale (> 10kb) genomic structural variations. As genomic technologies improve, we are detecting structural variation in ever-increasing numbers, including genomic inversions [24, 48, 71, 65, 31]; insertion/deletion polymorphisms [12, 26, 42]; and, copy number polymorphisms [28, 59, 60]. These large variations can completely disrupt coding and regulatory sites and copy number of genes, and thereby have a huge impact on human phenotypes and disease susceptibility [23, 61]. Deleterious effects have indeed been observed in cancer and other diseases [70, 43]. Our understanding of the scale and impact of these variations can be enhanced by improving computational tools for mining the data from these technologies. Here, I propose the development of algorithms and computational tools to improve detection and resolution (location of breakpoints) of structural variation. Specifically, I will develop algorithms for (a) experimental design of sequencing projects for detecting and resolving structural variations; (b) fine-mapping of breakpoints using end sequence profiling, to detect gene-disruption and gene-fusions; (c) reconstructing tumor genome architectures; (d) detection of targeted genomic variations in a heterogeneous mix of normal versus mutated cells via multiplex PCR; and (e) detection of balanced structural variation in genotype data. The tools will be designed using techniques from statistical machine learning and combinatorial algorithms. Validation will be performed using known structural variations, simulation studies, and extensive experimental collaborations with technology developers and early technology adopters. All of the data, and software will be freely available for academic and non-commercial uses.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed computational tools will be used to detect structural variations in human populations as a starting point for understanding their role in normal evolution and disease, specifically cancer. The architecture of tumor genomes will help reveal genes that are disrupted and differentially expressed in tumor cells.

"Genotype and phenotype predictors in therapy response in renal cell carcinoma     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Therapy of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has been transformed in recent years by the efficacy of targeted agents that inhibit kinases involved in critical cellular signaling pathways and VEGF, a primary driver of tumor angiogenesis. However, patient response to these therapeutics is highly variable and currently cannot be predicted based on clinical or pathological data or available laboratory/genetic testing. The goal of this proposal is to develop predictors of therapeutic response for patients with the most common subtype of RCC, clear cell (ccRCC), based on novel tests. Our approach is based primarily on the hypothesis that the targeted agents used in ccRCC therapy - bevacizumab, sunitinib and sorafenib - inhibit tumor vessel activation and that the activation status and stability of tumor vessels are major determinants of response. We also hypothesize that the phenotype of ccRCC tumor vessels is linked to the molecular pathobiology of the tumor cells. In particular, as these drugs also can inhibit tumor cell signaling and modulate their behavior, ccRCC tumor cell signaling, HIF-1/HIF-2 (hypoxia-inducible factor) expression and VHL function are potential determinants of response. To examine parameters of vascular phenotype, tumor cell phenotype and VHL genotype as predictors of response to therapy, ccRCC specimens will undergo multiplex immunostaining for the appropriate biomarker antigens and be analyzed by a novel computer-assisted image analysis system that objectively quantifies analyte staining on a cellular (cytometric) basis as well as by traditional pixel-based analysis. These studies will be performed on tumors of ccRCC patients treated with single-agent bevacizumab, sunitinib or sorafenib in ongoing multi-institutional phase II (ECOG2804) and phase III (ECOG2805) clinical trials, using tumor blocks from a subset of 90, 170 and 170 appropriate ccRCC patients for therapy with the respective drugs. The specific aims of this proposal are (Aim 1) to analyze the vascular and endothelial cell activation phenotype and vessel pericyte coverage in ccRCC tumors; (Aim 2) to analyze tumor cell signaling, HIF phenotype and VHL genotype in ccRCC tumors; and (Aim 3) to correlate parameters quantified in the prior aims for relationships to each other, to therapeutic outcome and to develop parsimonious predictive models of therapeutic response using biostatistical and bioinformatics approaches. The results of these studies should allow identification of the most appropriate drugs for treating individual patients with ccRCC and assist in the rational development of second-line and combination drug therapies. Beyond ccRCC, the targeted agents under study are used in the therapy of an ever expanding number of cancers, and the response predictors developed for ccRCC, where these agents are best studied because they are used as single-agents, may be useful for predicting response of these other cancers to combination therapy incorporating the targeted agents. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Novel targeted cancer therapy agents have shown success in the treatment of kidney cancer (renal cell carcinoma), a cancer that is increasing in incidence and newly diagnosed in over 50,000 Americans a year. Studies in this project will characterize the tumor blood vessel characteristics and genetic defect of renal cell carcinomas and correlate them with therapeutic response to identify factors that can predict whether they will respond to treatment. Discovering features of kidney cancer that predict therapeutic response can then be used to stratify patients to different therapies in the future   and will provide lessons that are likely to be applicable to many other cancers being treated with the same novel drugs.           Novel targeted cancer therapy agents have shown success in the treatment of kidney cancer (renal cell carcinoma), a cancer that is increasing in incidence and newly diagnosed in over 50,000 Americans a year.

"UCSC-Buck Inst. Genome Data Analysis Center for TCGA Research Network (GDAC)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project holds promise for a comprehensive understanding of human cancer through the application of genomic technologies. However, current cancer genomic analytical and visualization technologies still have many limitations that will likely prevent investigators from taking full advantage of this resource. The proposed UCSC-Buck Institute Genome Data Analysis Center will support an integrative analysis of TCGA data for all surveyed cancer types throughout the project. The major components of the pipeline are a pathway-centric multi-layer machine learning tool called Biolntegrator, a genome rearrangement detector for next-gen sequencing data, and the tightly coupled UCSC browser tool suite. We aim to detect cancer-associated molecular alterations and the biological pathways that are perturbed by them in tumor samples. Samples will then be classified into clinically relevant categories based on pathway perturbations rather than perturbations of individual genes, which we believe will be more robust, biologically meaningful and clinically accurate. Using Biolntegrator and the associated tools, we will further integrate TCGA data with datasets from external studies, including cell line studies, animal studies and clinical trials, to identify (1) cancer-associated molecular alterations; (2) dysregulated pathways and signatures useful in clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and drug response prediction; and (3) gene targets for the development of novel therapeutics. These results will provide the basis for a refined patient stratification in therapy and will generate new hypotheses for translational research. The tightly coupled UCSC browser suite, which will be enhanced to accommodate the needs of the TCGA project, includes the UCSC Cancer Genomics Browser for visualizing TCGA cancer genomics, clinical data, and analysis results; the UCSC Tumor Browser for displaying tumor genome rearrangements and other tumor mutations; and the UCSC Human Genome Browser for integrating the data with human genome annotations and information gleaned from other projects such as ENCODE and the NIH Epigenomics Roadmap Initiative. The browser resource, hosting this rapidly growing body of cancer genomics data, will enable investigators to perform interactive in-silico experiments to test new hypotheses derived from the TCGA data. Collectively, these proposed tools will enable cancer researchers to better explore the breadth and depth of the TCGA resources and to further characterize molecular pathways that influence cellular dynamics and stability in cancer. Ultimately, insights gained by applying these tools will advance our knowledge of human cancer biology and stimulate the discovery of new prognostic and diagnostic markers, leading to new therapeutic and preventative strategies.              ",UCSC-Buck Inst.

"A Functional Census of p53 Cancer and Suppressor Mutants    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The transcription factor p53 is a central tumor suppressor protein that controls DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis. About half of human cancers have p53 mutations, and restoring p53 function in advanced tumors leads to tumor regression. Significantly, the large majority of these tumors produce full-length p53 proteins that have lost their tumor suppressor function due to single amino acid changes. Therefore, an attractive new approach to systemic cancer therapy is pharmacological reactivation of p53 cancer mutants. Reactivation of p53 cancer mutants is feasible because we and others have shown that introducing additional mutations (second-site suppressor mutations) can restore activity to the otherwise inactive p53 cancer mutants. In addition a few promising small molecule drug leads with unknown mechanisms of action have been reported to reactivate p53 cancer mutants. The challenge is to understand structural changes that lead to reactivation of p53 cancer mutants and to induce such changes through small molecules. This is a complex problem due to the diversity of clinically relevant single amino acid changes found in p53 cancer mutants.  We propose computational approaches based on machine learning that are supported by high-throughput biological strategies. We use novel saturation mutagenesis approaches to catalogue p53 rescue mutations for the 50 most relevant p53 mutants found in human cancer. The genetic data are used in an active learning scheme to train a computational classifier, that is based on modeled atom-level structural features, to predict which structural changes lead to reactivation of any given p53 cancer mutant. We further propose to apply this improved computational classifier to discover small molecules that induce similar structural changes and test these pre-selected compounds in a biological assay for p53 cancer mutant reactivation. Data obtained from these in vivo experiments will be used to further improve the computational predictions for small molecules.  In summary, we use genetic functional data to train a structure-based classifier to predict p53 activity based on an internal representation of modeled structural changes. The classifier will then be used to predict reactivation of p53 cancer mutants by small molecules with the aim to identify cancer drug leads. The proposed research has high impact on biomedical research and public health. About 250,000 US deaths yearly are due to tumors with full length but mutated and inactive p53. The long-term goal of this research, a drug that reactivates mutant p53, could prevent or delay these deaths.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The tumor suppressor protein p53 is the single most important protein to prevent cancer, and half of all human tumors produce a defective p53 protein. Pharmacological reactivation of the defective p53 proteins could potentially prevent or delay over 250,000 cancer deaths yearly in the US alone. This proposal uses genetic strategies and computational approaches to predict p53 reactivation by small molecules that can eventually develop into cancer drugs.                        The tumor suppressor protein p53 is the single most important protein to prevent cancer, and half of all human tumors produce a defective p53 protein.

"Integrative Cancer Genomics: Drivers, Pathways and Drugs     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The emergence of cancer genomics, combined with increased understanding of the molecular basis of oncogenesis, has stimulated hope that treatment will improve by becoming more targeted and individualized in nature. Cancer genomics studies established a number of critical cancer genes, leading to a number of successful targeted therapies (e.g. Gleevec, Herceptin and Plexxikon). Despite these successes, most cancers do not have a targeted therapy and when one exists, response is highly variable, even among patients that share the targeted mutation and tumor type. To move cancer into the era of personalized therapies, it becomes important to identify the alterations driving tumor progression in each tumor, determine the network that links these aberrations, and identify factors that predict sensitivity to targeted therapies. As projects such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) amass cancer cell genomes at a breathtaking pace, a staggering genetic complexity is revealed. To interpret cancer genomes, a key computational challenge is to separate the wheat from the chaff and define both what are the key alterations likely to be functionally driving cancer and then, after defining such genes, begin to identify mechanisms of action and therapeutic implications. Leveraging components from our published methods, CONEXIC (Akavia et.al Cell 2010) and LirNet (Lee et.al, PLOS Gen 2009), we will develop machine-learning algorithms that integrate cancer genomic data to do just that. We will apply the methods we develop to melanoma, glioblastoma, ovarian, breast and colon cancer and experimentally follow up on our computational findings, towards a better understanding of each of these deadly cancers. The approaches developed in this grant will accelerate discovery to rapidly extract the maximal value from modern genomic studies and help carry cancer genomics from the diagnostic to the therapeutic realm.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This work aims to develop methods that help dissect the genetic complexity of individual cancers.

"Systems Biology of Tumor Progression and Drug Resistance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The emergence of multidimensional datasets characterizing genetic, epigenetic, and functional properties of large normal and tumor-related samples is creating unique opportunities for the systems-level dissection of mechanisms associated with malignant phenotypes. Coupled with novel high-throughput technologies and computational methodologies for the dissection, interrogation, and perturbation of genome-wide regulatory pathways, this will lead to highly efficient approaches for the rapid identification and validation of therapeutic targets, their small molecule inhibitors, and associated biomarkers. Columbia University investigators have pioneered systems-biology-based approaches for the dissection of regulatory networks in human malignancies and for their interrogation, using computational, RNAi, and small-molecule approaches, to identify molecular targets for therapeutic intervention. The goal of this project is the use and build upon a successful pipeline between the investigators labs for the discovery and validation of master regulator modules that implement functional bottlenecks that integrate aberrant signals from multiple genetic and epigenetic alterations, and thus, constitute natural dependencies (i.e., Achille's heel) for the tumor subtype. These will be characterized in terms of their synergistic behavior, driver genetic alterations, and druggable modulators. This pipeline will allow processing of a novel tumor phenotype every 18 to 24 months, yielding validated individual and synergistic targets that constitute either oncogene or non-oncogene dependencies of the tumor or that increase sensitivity to existing FDA approved or late-stage development compounds. Relevance: The identification of targets that abrogate tumorigenesis in the patient, are extensively biochemically characterized, chemically tractable, and highly penetrant constitutes one of the greatest challenges of cancer research.

"Genotype and phenotype predictors in therapy response in renal cell carcinoma  ABSTRACT Therapy of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has been transformed in recent years by the efficacy of targeted agents that inhibit kinases involved in critical cellular signaling pathways and VEGF, a primary driver of tumor angiogenesis. However, patient response to these therapeutics is highly variable and currently cannot be predicted based on clinical or pathological data or available laboratory/genetic testing. The goal of this proposal is to develop predictors of therapeutic response for patients with the most common subtype of RCC, clear cell (ccRCC), based on novel tests. Our approach is based primarily on the hypothesis that the targeted agents used in ccRCC therapy - bevacizumab, sunitinib and sorafenib - inhibit tumor vessel activation and that the activation status and stability of tumor vessels are major determinants of response. We also hypothesize that the phenotype of ccRCC tumor vessels is linked to the molecular pathobiology of the tumor cells. In particular, as these drugs also can inhibit tumor cell signaling and modulate their behavior, ccRCC tumor cell signaling, HIF-1/HIF-2 (hypoxia-inducible factor) expression and VHL function are potential determinants of response. To examine parameters of vascular phenotype, tumor cell phenotype and VHL genotype as predictors of response to therapy, ccRCC specimens will undergo multiplex immunostaining for the appropriate biomarker antigens and be analyzed by a novel computer-assisted image analysis system that objectively quantifies analyte staining on a cellular (cytometric) basis as well as by traditional pixel-based analysis. These studies will be performed on tumors of ccRCC patients treated with single-agent bevacizumab, sunitinib or sorafenib in ongoing multi-institutional phase II (ECOG2804) and phase III (ECOG2805) clinical trials, using tumor blocks from a subset of 90, 170 and 170 appropriate ccRCC patients for therapy with the respective drugs. The specific aims of this proposal are (Aim 1) to analyze the vascular and endothelial cell activation phenotype and vessel pericyte coverage in ccRCC tumors; (Aim 2) to analyze tumor cell signaling, HIF phenotype and VHL genotype in ccRCC tumors; and (Aim 3) to correlate parameters quantified in the prior aims for relationships to each other, to therapeutic outcome and to develop parsimonious predictive models of therapeutic response using biostatistical and bioinformatics approaches. The results of these studies should allow identification of the most appropriate drugs for treating individual patients with ccRCC and assist in the rational development of second-line and combination drug therapies. Beyond ccRCC, the targeted agents under study are used in the therapy of an ever expanding number of cancers, and the response predictors developed for ccRCC, where these agents are best studied because they are used as single-agents, may be useful for predicting response of these other cancers to combination therapy incorporating the targeted agents.  Novel targeted cancer therapy agents have shown success in the treatment of kidney cancer (renal cell carcinoma), a cancer that is increasing in incidence and newly diagnosed in over 50,000 Americans a year. Studies in this project will characterize the tumor blood vessel characteristics and genetic defect of renal cell carcinomas and correlate them with therapeutic response to identify factors that can predict whether they will respond to treatment. Discovering features of kidney cancer that predict therapeutic response can then be used to stratify patients to different therapies in the future and will provide lessons that are likely to be applicable to many other cancers being treated with the same novel drugs.",Genotype and phenotype predictors in therapy response in renal cell carcinoma,8271303,R01CA135509,"['Algorithms ', '

"Algorithmic strategies for detecting structural variation in genomes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fine-scale nucleotide changes, along with genetic recombination, are often cited as the major source of human genetic variation [1, 13, 14]. Less is known about larger scale (> 10kb) genomic structural variations. As genomic technologies improve, we are detecting structural variation in ever-increasing numbers, including genomic inversions [24, 48, 71, 65, 31]; insertion/deletion polymorphisms [12, 26, 42]; and, copy number polymorphisms [28, 59, 60]. These large variations can completely disrupt coding and regulatory sites and copy number of genes, and thereby have a huge impact on human phenotypes and disease susceptibility [23, 61]. Deleterious effects have indeed been observed in cancer and other diseases [70, 43]. Our understanding of the scale and impact of these variations can be enhanced by improving computational tools for mining the data from these technologies. Here, I propose the development of algorithms and computational tools to improve detection and resolution (location of breakpoints) of structural variation. Specifically, I will develop algorithms for (a) experimental design of sequencing projects for detecting and resolving structural variations; (b) fine-mapping of breakpoints using end sequence profiling, to detect gene-disruption and gene-fusions; (c) reconstructing tumor genome architectures; (d) detection of targeted genomic variations in a heterogeneous mix of normal versus mutated cells via multiplex PCR; and (e) detection of balanced structural variation in genotype data. The tools will be designed using techniques from statistical machine learning and combinatorial algorithms. Validation will be performed using known structural variations, simulation studies, and extensive experimental collaborations with technology developers and early technology adopters. All of the data, and software will be freely available for academic and non-commercial uses.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed computational tools will be used to detect structural variations in human populations as a starting point for understanding their role in normal evolution and disease, specifically cancer. The architecture of tumor genomes will help reveal genes that are disrupted and differentially expressed in tumor cells. The targeted detection of genomic lesions in a heterogeneous mix of mutated and wildtype cells, will find application as an early diagnostic for cancer. Thus, our computational methods will have an immediate and long term effect on human health.

"Molecular Characterization of Parotid Gland Tumors  7. Project Summary/Abstract  Salivary gland tumors constitute 1-6% of head and neck tumors numbering 3600 new cases per year in the US. Though rare, there are 37 histopathological malignant subtypes and 13 benign subtypes of salivary gland tumors, making it one of the most challenging tumors to diagnose. While surgery is the main modality of treatment, advance unresectable primary, recurrent and metastatic tumors are generally fatal. The rarity of the tumors and multiple histopathological subtypes generated major clinical challenges for the early detection, diagnosis, therapeutic interventions and prognosis of patients with salivary gland tumors.  This application addresses the missing gaps in salivary gland tumor research by advancing the basic and translational sciences. Our approach is to perform comprehensive molecular characterization of salivary gland tumors using the most advanced omics technologies coupled with advanced data and bioinformatics analysis to develop tissue-based biomarkers for salivary gland malignancy detection as well as the potential use of salivary biomarkers to screen/risk assess symptomatic patients for salivary gland malignancies. In additional a systems network analysis approach (Weighted-Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis, WGCNA) will be use to examine the derived omics databases to identify pivotal molecular pathways and gene targets for salivary gland malignancy development. Collective these approaches will lead to translational and mechanistic insights for salivary tumor development that can be further translated for clinical applications as well as mechanistic evaluations using rodent models for salivary gland carcinogenesis.  Six Specific Aims are in place to test the hypothesis in this application. Aim 1 is to procure fresh frozen malignant and benign parotid gland tissues from the UCLA Head & Neck Oncology Clinic. Aim 2 is to perform comprehensive profiling of parotid gland tumors' transcriptome; microRNA and epigenome using most advanced RNA sequencing and methylomics arrays. Aim 3 will perform statistical and bioinformatics analysis for the omics databases to select candidate biomarkers that can detect parotid gland malignancies. These candidate biomarkers will be pre-validated in Aim 4 in an independent cohort of parotid gland malignant and benign tumors. Aim 5 is to explore the hypothesis that tissue-based dysregulated biomarkers in malignant parotid glands are concordantly dysregulated in saliva of these patients. Finally Aim 6 is a systems network based analysis of the omics databases to identify critical biological pathways and gene targets that are pivotal in the development of parotid gland malignancies. These pathway and targets outcome can be evaluated in future mechanistic studies in salivary gland malignancy development by rodent models or cell lines.  Our multidisciplinary research team has the expertise and track record to carry out the proposed molecular characterization of parotid gland tumors as well as expertise to carryout the mechanistic and translational next steps to fully materialize the goals of this RFA.  8. Relevance to Public Health Statement  Salivary gland tumors are rare. However, they are aggressive and fatal. Due to its rarity (1-6% of head and neck cancers) and the fact that there are 24 variants of salivary gland cancers and 13 variants of benign subtypes, clinical diagnosis of salivary gland tumor is one of the worst, hampering treatment decisions and prognostics outcomes of patients. This application takes the novel and impactful approach to generate the most comprehensive molecular profile of salivary gland tumors to develop molecular signatures of salivary gland malignancies, saliva based biomarkers for early detection of salivary gland cancers and informatics outcomes that will identify critical biological pathways and gene targets that are involved in the mechanistic development of salivary gland malignancies. The outcomes of this application are molecular signatures of parotid gland cancer to assist clinical diagnosis; salivary biomarkers to assist early detection of salivary gland cancers and identified biological pathways and gene targets for mechanistic evaluation in rodent models for salivary gland tumor carcinogenesis.",Molecular Characterization of Parotid Gland Tumors,8534892,R56DE023241,"['Abbreviations ', ' abstracting ', ' Malignant Adenoma ', ' Adenocarcinoma ', ' Warthin Tumor ', ' Papillary Cystadenoma Lymphomatosum ', ' Adenolymphoma ', ' adenoma ', ' antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity ', ' Antibody-Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity ', ' Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytoxicity ', ' ADCC ', ' Antibody -dependent cell cytotoxicity ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biopsy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' adenoid cystic cancer ', ' Cylindroid Adenocarcinoma ', ' Adenocystic Carcinoma ', ' Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Freezing ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' head and neck tumor ', ' Head and Neck Neoplasms ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Laboratories ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' tumor cell metastasis ', ' cancer metastasis ', ' Tumor Cell Migration ', ' Secondary Tumor ', ' Secondary Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Tumor ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm ', ' Metastasize ', ' Metastasis ', ' Neoplasm Metastasis ', ' otorhinolaryngology ', ' Oto/Rhino/Laryngology ', ' Otolaryngology ', ' Parotid ', ' Parotid Gland ', ' Parotid Tumor ', ' Parotid Gland Tumor ', ' Parotid Gland Neoplasm ', ' Parotid Neoplasms ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' mRNA ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' Saliva ', ' Salivary Gland Tumor ', ' Salivary Gland Neoplasms ', ' Salivary Glands Head and Neck ', ' Salivary Glands ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' Weight ', ' hydrosulfite ', ' hydrogen sulfite ', ' bisulfite ', ' Generations ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' RNA Sequences ', ' base ', ' density ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Malignant ', ' Malignant -

"UCSC-Buck Inst. Genome Data Analysis Center for TCGA Research Network (GDAC) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project holds promise for a comprehensive understanding of human cancer through the application of genomic technologies. However, current cancer genomic analytical and visualization technologies still have many limitations that will likely prevent investigators from taking full advantage of this resource. The proposed UCSC-Buck Institute Genome Data Analysis Center will support an integrative analysis of TCGA data for all surveyed cancer types throughout the project. The major components of the pipeline are a pathway-centric multi-layer machine learning tool called Biolntegrator, a genome rearrangement detector for next-gen sequencing data, and the tightly coupled UCSC browser tool suite. We aim to detect cancer-associated molecular alterations and the biological pathways that are perturbed by them in tumor samples. Samples will then be classified into clinically relevant categories based on pathway perturbations rather than perturbations of individual genes, which we believe will be more robust, biologically meaningful and clinically accurate. Using Biolntegrator and the associated tools, we will further integrate TCGA data with datasets from external studies, including cell line studies, animal studies and clinical trials, to identify (1) cancer-associated molecular alterations; (2) dysregulated pathways and signatures useful in clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and drug response prediction; and (3) gene targets for the development of novel therapeutics. These results will provide the basis for a refined patient stratification in therapy and will generate new hypotheses for translational research. The tightly coupled UCSC browser suite, which will be enhanced to accommodate the needs of the TCGA project, includes the UCSC Cancer Genomics Browser for visualizing TCGA cancer genomics, clinical data, and analysis results; the UCSC Tumor Browser for displaying tumor genome rearrangements and other tumor mutations; and the UCSC Human Genome Browser for integrating the data with human genome annotations and information gleaned from other projects such as ENCODE and the NIH Epigenomics Roadmap Initiative. The browser resource, hosting this rapidly growing body of cancer genomics data, will enable investigators to perform interactive in-silico experiments to test new hypotheses derived from the TCGA data. Collectively, these proposed tools will enable cancer researchers to better explore the breadth and depth of the TCGA resources and to further characterize molecular pathways that influence cellular dynamics and stability in cancer. Ultimately, insights gained by applying these tools will advance our knowledge of human cancer biology and stimulate the discovery of new prognostic and diagnostic markers, leading to new therapeutic and preventative strategies. The UCSC-Buck Institute Cancer Genome Data Analysis Center aims to analyze the TCGA project data to  identify (1) cancer-associated molecular alterations; (2) dysregulated pathway signatures that can be used in  clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and drug response prediction; and (3) candidate gene targets for the  development of novel therapeutics.

"Reliable Human-Model Observers for Emission Tomography    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our overall objective is to develop numerical observers for dependable technology evaluations in emission tomography. Positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission tomography (SPECT) are the primary clinical modalities for imaging many types of cancer. However, early de- tection often presents the best chances of surviving cancer whereas these imaging modalities have limited diagnostic utility for small tumors. Systematic task-based developmental assessments could facilitate early identification of promising new technology for improving the diagnostic capabilities of these modalities. Yet, assessments with human observers are generally impractical for developmental use. Moreover, available mathematical models (or numerical observers) intended to predict human performance-what we refer to as human-model observers-present significant limits, including con- straints on the types of diagnostic tasks that can be considered. Partly because of these constraints, existing human-model observers frequently require revalidation given any change to the imaging pro- cess. Our approach to observer development is founded on the concept of task equivalence, whereby the task for the numerical observer mirrors the desired clinical task as closely as possible. In this grant, we propose a novel observer framework that is influenced by descriptions of radiologists' visual-search (VS) processes, in which an initial global scan of an image identifies candidate locations deserving closer inspection. We shall use the VS paradigm to investigate the hypotheses that task equivalence i) can lead to a human-observer model that reliably generalizes to a wide range of diagnostic tasks, and ii) is necessary to ensure truly relevant task-based evaluations. We shall test these hypotheses through observer studies with fluorine-18 deoxyglucose (FDG) whole-body PET and SPECT In-111 imaging of neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). A state-of-the-art model observer for developmental stud- ies should be capable of detection-localization tasks, and our observer studies will be analyzed with jackknife FROC (JAFROC) methodology. The specific aims of this work are to: 1) determine what features of FDG-PET image slices attract initial human-observer attention; 2) develop a VS numerical observer for tumor detection-localization tasks in FDG-PET; 3) test the VS observer against humans in a JAFROC detection-localization study featuring hybrid PET images; 4) investigate generalizations of the VS observer to SPECT and 3D detection-localization tasks; and 5) compare system optimiza- tions for oncologic SPECT obtained from the VS and existing numerical observers. The application is optimization of a parallel-hole collimator design for In-111 NET imaging.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Functional imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission tomog- raphy (SPECT) has a significant role in cancer diagnosis and management.

"A Functional Census of p53 Cancer and Suppressor Mutants    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The transcription factor p53 is a central tumor suppressor protein that controls DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis. About half of human cancers have p53 mutations, and restoring p53 function in advanced tumors leads to tumor regression. Significantly, the large majority of these tumors produce full-length p53 proteins that have lost their tumor suppressor function due to single amino acid changes. Therefore, an attractive new approach to systemic cancer therapy is pharmacological reactivation of p53 cancer mutants. Reactivation of p53 cancer mutants is feasible because we and others have shown that introducing additional mutations (second-site suppressor mutations) can restore activity to the otherwise inactive p53 cancer mutants. In addition a few promising small molecule drug leads with unknown mechanisms of action have been reported to reactivate p53 cancer mutants. The challenge is to understand structural changes that lead to reactivation of p53 cancer mutants and to induce such changes through small molecules. This is a complex problem due to the diversity of clinically relevant single amino acid changes found in p53 cancer mutants.  We propose computational approaches based on machine learning that are supported by high-throughput biological strategies. We use novel saturation mutagenesis approaches to catalogue p53 rescue mutations for the 50 most relevant p53 mutants found in human cancer. The genetic data are used in an active learning scheme to train a computational classifier, that is based on modeled atom-level structural features, to predict which structural changes lead to reactivation of any given p53 cancer mutant. We further propose to apply this improved computational classifier to discover small molecules that induce similar structural changes and test these pre-selected compounds in a biological assay for p53 cancer mutant reactivation. Data obtained from these in vivo experiments will be used to further improve the computational predictions for small molecules.  In summary, we use genetic functional data to train a structure-based classifier to predict p53 activity based on an internal representation of modeled structural changes. The classifier will then be used to predict reactivation of p53 cancer mutants by small molecules with the aim to identify cancer drug leads. The proposed research has high impact on biomedical research and public health. About 250,000 US deaths yearly are due to tumors with full length but mutated and inactive p53. The long-term goal of this research, a drug that reactivates mutant p53, could prevent or delay these deaths.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The tumor suppressor protein p53 is the single most important protein to prevent cancer, and half of all human tumors produce a defective p53 protein. Pharmacological reactivation of the defective p53 proteins could potentially prevent or delay over 250,000 cancer deaths yearly in the US alone. This proposal uses genetic strategies and computational approaches to predict p53 reactivation by small molecules that can eventually develop into cancer drugs.

"Objective decision support environment for clinical trials     DESCRIPTION:  Brain tumors are the second- and fifth-most common cause of cancer death in males and females under 40, respectively. The 5-year relative survival rate is only 33%, even after decades of research into new treatments. Imaging based on ""virtual biopsy"" can provide information about the entire lesion in a minimally or non-invasive way. Prior work by our group has demonstrated that image processing methods applied to serial examinations together (as opposed to applying them to individual examinations) can make subtle changes in brain tumors more apparent, allowing earlier detection of progression. We see the union of virtual biopsy methods and change detection methods as an innovative and powerful combination that our team is uniquely qualified to develop and evaluate. In this application, we will implement several feature selection (FS) methods in a tool that is ""image friendly"". This tool will help select informative features from images; apply a wide range of existing ML algorithms to determine which features are important predictors of therapy response, and to evaluate the impact of a decision support application using these features and ML in a clinical trial. The final stage of th proposal will test the decision support tools in 3 clinical scenarios to see if they are able to significantly improve the decision making of clinicians in a clinical trial.  The long-term goal of this proposal is to develop virtual biopsy technology that will enhance the clinical decision making process by providing tools for investigation of image-based therapy response assessment tools, that may also have some ability to predict outcome. We hope to apply the technology to other organ systems and other imaging technologies. We anticipate this project will impact clinical trials by enabling investigation of alternative outcome measures that are objectively assessed using algorithm evaluation methods. Such a toolset should be useful to the entire cancer imaging community to help evaluate features in old and new imaging technologies that correlate with patient survival. As such, this is ideal for helping the Quantitative Imaging Network (QIN) achieve its goals.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The selection of features that reflect response to therapy has long been the domain of the clinical radiologist. When imaging was relatively straightforward (e.g. a chest X-ray of lung cancer), a measurement or a visual assessment was a reasonable metric. Today, advanced imaging devices produce large amounts of data that reflect a range of properties. In this work, we build on previous work developing computer techniques for identifying and characterizing changes in brain tumors, using MRI. In this proposal, we will focus on building 1) a high quality database of brain cancer imaging, clinical data, ""-omic"" data, outcomes data; 2) a library of easily accessed tools for computing features that might be important predictors of tumor response; 3) a tool that will help objectively establish the feature() that are valuable through a variety of machine learning methods; and 4) use the above to create a decision support tool that will be used in 3 clinical trial situations.  .               The selection of features that reflect response to therapy has long been the domain of the clinical radiologist.

"Statistical atlases of brain tumor MRI:do imaging phenotypes predict progression?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Statistical atlases, and associated image analysis methods, have found widespread use in several neuroimaging fields, presenting a powerful way to integrate diverse imaging information, correlate it with genetic and clinical measurements, understand effects of disease on brain structure and function, and construct diagnostic tools. This proposal will combine statistical image analysis, deformable registration, and biophysical modeling approaches to an integrated framework for constructing and clinically using statistical atlases from brain tumor patients. Emphasis is placed on gliomas, which have very poor prognosis due to cancer infiltration beyond the visible tumor boundary. Accordingly, the ultimate clinical goal of this study is to identify subtle imaging characteristics of brain tissue that is likely to be infiltrated by tumor, as well as of tissue that is likely to present recurrence in relatively shorter time period. This will be achieved by studying the multi-modal imaging phenotypes of healthy and pathologic tissues in conjunction with spatial information, including the spatial pattern of the tumor and the proximity of malignant tissue to white matter fiber pathways, and by correlating these phenotypes with clinical information, including tumor recurrence. The hypothesis is that signal and spatial information together will be able to identify brain tissues that are likely to later present recurrence. The main technical challenges that will be overcome are 1) development of computationally efficient biophysical models of tumor growth, diffusion, and mass effect; 2) development of deformable registration methods that will allow us to co-register tumor-bearing brain images and build a population-based atlas-the main challenges here are to estimate the appropriate tumor parameters as well as the location of peri-tumor anatomy that is typically confounded by edema, infiltration and extreme deformations; and 3) development of machine learning methods for characterizing subtle abnormalities of brain tissue, and for identifying tissue that is likely to present recurrence after resection and treatment. Pilot studies on the feasibility of this approach to larger clinical studies will be performed on a database of brain MR images obtained from glioma patients via a rich and extensive acquisition protocol, including perfusion, diffusion tensor imaging, spectroscopy, and conventional imaging.

"Quantitative PET/CT Analysis to Improve Evaluation of Tumor Response     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose to develop and validate a quantitative Positron Emission Tomography / Computed Tomography (PET/CT) image analysis framework to improve the evaluation of esophageal tumor response to chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer. In Aim 1, we will extract comprehensive spatial and temporal features of a tumor from PET/CT images and evaluate their ability in predicting tumor response to CRT. These features will quantify the spatial characteristics of a tumor along with their changes due to CRT, adding a great amount of information to the current non-volumetric PET/CT response measures. Also, we will use image registration techniques to align pre-CRT images with post-CRT images, making it possible to quantify the spatial changes at the original tumor site. In Aim 2, we will construct and test reliable predictive models of tumo response to CRT using machine learning techniques with spatial- temporal PET/CT features, clinical parameters and demographics as input. The models will identify an optimal subset of predictive features and utilize PET and CT information in chorus. In Aim 3, we will develop a novel multi-modality adaptive region-growing algorithm for tumor delineation in PET/CT. We will compare the accuracy and precision of the resulting predictive models against those in which tumor is delineated using conventional methods (manual contouring or thresholding). This comparison will help us understand to what degree the prediction of tumor response depends on the tumor delineation methods. Finally, we will use pathologic response and survival as the end points and ground truth to cross-validate each predictive model. If all aims are achieved, the proposed PET/CT image analysis framework may provide a highly accurate diagnostic tool. This, will complement other diagnostic tests in assisting physicians in making a treatment decision to more appropriately select patients for surgery, thus avoiding the mortality and morbidity of surgery in responders for whom surgery can be safely deferred; while improving local control and survival in non- responders for whom surgery should be considered. Therefore, this work has the potential to improve outcomes by safely deferring surgery which will improve our locally advanced esophageal cancer patient's quality of life while simultaneously reducing costs.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We propose to develop and validate a quantitative Positron Emission Tomography / Computed Tomography (PET/CT) image analysis framework to improve the evaluation of esophageal tumor response to chemoradiotherapy.

"A Functional Census of p53 Cancer and Suppressor Mutants    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The transcription factor p53 is a central tumor suppressor protein that controls DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis. About half of human cancers have p53 mutations, and restoring p53 function in advanced tumors leads to tumor regression. Significantly, the large majority of these tumors produce full-length p53 proteins that have lost their tumor suppressor function due to single amino acid changes. Therefore, an attractive new approach to systemic cancer therapy is pharmacological reactivation of p53 cancer mutants. Reactivation of p53 cancer mutants is feasible because we and others have shown that introducing additional mutations (second-site suppressor mutations) can restore activity to the otherwise inactive p53 cancer mutants. In addition a few promising small molecule drug leads with unknown mechanisms of action have been reported to reactivate p53 cancer mutants. The challenge is to understand structural changes that lead to reactivation of p53 cancer mutants and to induce such changes through small molecules. This is a complex problem due to the diversity of clinically relevant single amino acid changes found in p53 cancer mutants.  We propose computational approaches based on machine learning that are supported by high-throughput biological strategies. We use novel saturation mutagenesis approaches to catalogue p53 rescue mutations for the 50 most relevant p53 mutants found in human cancer. The genetic data are used in an active learning scheme to train a computational classifier, that is based on modeled atom-level structural features, to predict which structural changes lead to reactivation of any given p53 cancer mutant. We further propose to apply this improved computational classifier to discover small molecules that induce similar structural changes and test these pre-selected compounds in a biological assay for p53 cancer mutant reactivation. Data obtained from these in vivo experiments will be used to further improve the computational predictions for small molecules.  In summary, we use genetic functional data to train a structure-based classifier to predict p53 activity based on an internal representation of modeled structural changes. The classifier will then be used to predict reactivation of p53 cancer mutants by small molecules with the aim to identify cancer drug leads. The proposed research has high impact on biomedical research and public health. About 250,000 US deaths yearly are due to tumors with full length but mutated and inactive p53. The long-term goal of this research, a drug that reactivates mutant p53, could prevent or delay these deaths.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The tumor suppressor protein p53 is the single most important protein to prevent cancer, and half of all human tumors produce a defective p53 protein.

"Integrative Cancer Genomics: Drivers, Pathways and Drugs     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The emergence of cancer genomics, combined with increased understanding of the molecular basis of oncogenesis, has stimulated hope that treatment will improve by becoming more targeted and individualized in nature. Cancer genomics studies established a number of critical cancer genes, leading to a number of successful targeted therapies (e.g. Gleevec, Herceptin and Plexxikon). Despite these successes, most cancers do not have a targeted therapy and when one exists, response is highly variable, even among patients that share the targeted mutation and tumor type. To move cancer into the era of personalized therapies, it becomes important to identify the alterations driving tumor progression in each tumor, determine the network that links these aberrations, and identify factors that predict sensitivity to targeted therapies. As projects such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) amass cancer cell genomes at a breathtaking pace, a staggering genetic complexity is revealed. To interpret cancer genomes, a key computational challenge is to separate the wheat from the chaff and define both what are the key alterations likely to be functionally driving cancer and then, after defining such genes, begin to identify mechanisms of action and therapeutic implications. Leveraging components from our published methods, CONEXIC (Akavia et.al Cell 2010) and LirNet (Lee et.al, PLOS Gen 2009), we will develop machine-learning algorithms that integrate cancer genomic data to do just that. We will apply the methods we develop to melanoma, glioblastoma, ovarian, breast and colon cancer and experimentally follow up on our computational findings, towards a better understanding of each of these deadly cancers. The approaches developed in this grant will accelerate discovery to rapidly extract the maximal value from modern genomic studies and help carry cancer genomics from the diagnostic to the therapeutic realm.          This work aims to develop methods that help dissect the genetic complexity of individual cancers. For each tumor we aim to identify which mutations arm a cell with the abilities to abnormally grow or evade drug treatment, providing a foundation of tools towards personalized cancer treatment. We will apply these methods for discovery in some of the most aggressive cancers that currently lack good therapeutic solutions including glioblastoma, ovarian cancer and melanoma.

"Systems Biology of Tumor Progression and Drug Resistance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The emergence of multidimensional datasets characterizing genetic, epigenetic, and functional properties of large normal and tumor-related samples is creating unique opportunities for the systems-level dissection of mechanisms associated with malignant phenotypes. Coupled with novel high-throughput technologies and computational methodologies for the dissection, interrogation, and perturbation of genome-wide regulatory pathways, this will lead to highly efficient approaches for the rapid identification and validation of therapeutic targets, their small molecule inhibitors, and associated biomarkers. Columbia University investigators have pioneered systems-biology-based approaches for the dissection of regulatory networks in human malignancies and for their interrogation, using computational, RNAi, and small-molecule approaches, to identify molecular targets for therapeutic intervention. The goal of this project is the use and build upon a successful pipeline between the investigators labs for the discovery and validation of master regulator modules that implement functional bottlenecks that integrate aberrant signals from multiple genetic and epigenetic alterations, and thus, constitute natural dependencies (i.e., Achille's heel) for the tumor subtype. These will be characterized in terms of their synergistic behavior, driver genetic alterations, and druggable modulators. This pipeline will allow processing of a novel tumor phenotype every 18 to 24 months, yielding validated individual and synergistic targets that constitute either oncogene or non-oncogene dependencies of the tumor or that increase sensitivity to existing FDA approved or late-stage development compounds. Relevance: The identification of targets that abrogate tumorigenesis in the patient, are extensively biochemically characterized, chemically tractable, and highly penetrant constitutes one of the greatest challenges of cancer research. The goal of this proposal is to leverage an integrative computational and experimental pipeline for the systematic identification of novel potential targets that may inspire future development of therapeutic applications.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The identification of targets that abrogate tumorigenesis in the patient, are extensively biochemically characterized, chemically tractable, and highly penetrant constitutes one of the greatest challenges of cancer research.

"Systems microscopy analysis of tumor cell motility in microenvironment context     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Candidate: Majoring as analytical chemist during the time in Belgrade, Serbia, Dr. Gligorijevic has become an expert in optics and live cell microscopy over the course of her graduate training at Georgetown University and developed several novel microscopy-based technologies. During the postdoctoral period, Dr. Gligorijevic has focused on studying tumor cell intravasation in breast tumors, in living animals. To do so, she introduced several advancements into in vivo multiphoton microscopy. Dr. Gligorijevic is funded by DOD and Charles Revson Fellowship and has received several honors for her research. Her work to date resulted in one patent, ten peer-reviewed and ten other publications. Recent research has shown that different components of tumor microenvironment have an essential role in tumor progression. In order to decipher the network of interactions which shape the tumor environment and determine tumor cell behavior, it is ideal to apply systems biology approaches combined with in vivo microscopy, as cell cultures are limited in their complexity, mouse models are time-consuming and expensive and in silico models need optimization based on experiments. During the mentored phase of the Award, Dr. Gligorijevic will incorporate the relevant principles of advanced statistics and mathematical modeling of dynamical systems into her background of tumor biology and microscopy. She will take coursework offered at Einstein and meet regularly with her sponsor and co-sponsor. This training will make it possible to build a laboratory which investigates mechanisms of metastasis using the integrative, systems microscopy approach and utilizing information from molecular to population levels.     Environment: Sponsor of the PI, Dr. John Condeelis is a Co-Chair of Anatomy Department and Biophotonic Center at Einstein. His lab and the Center create a multidisciplinary environment focused on answering mechanisms of human diseases, such as cancer, through use of microscopy. The Center is well known for its shared imaging resources and Innovation Laboratory where new microscopy systems are custom-built to accommodate specific needs of different projects. Consulting member of Advisory Committee, Dr. Robert Singer, is an expert in combining experimental and theoretical biology and a renowned mentor. The co-sponsor, Dr. Aviv Bergman, is the Founding Chair of Systems Department at Einstein and teaches coursework which will be a part of the career development. Einstein is an institution which highly values collaboration and insists on career development of postdoctoral fellows, instructors and junior faculty.     Research: While most research of tumor microenvironments focuses on isolating and understanding single parameters, an integrative, systems-level network of interactions among relevant biological players is missing. In primary tumors, there are numerous biomechanical signals able to direct tumor cell movement towards and into the blood vessels. Growth factors, secreted by host macrophages, fibroblasts and endothelial cells in the tumor microenvironment are the main chemoattractants but recent studies show that the extracellular matrix also plays an important role. In loose extracellular matrix, tumor cells can migrate by reorganizing their cytoskeleton, generating a protrusive force. In regions with stiff extracellular matrix, simple locomotion is not possible. Here, tumor cells become invasive and degrade extracellular matrix, mainly by matrix metalloproteases (MMPs). Tumor cell migration was well characterized in vivo, but the mechanism of the switch from locomotory to invasive state and assembly of invasive protrusions in vivo are unknown. To address the link between integrated microenvironment signaling and the tumor cell behavior, it is necessary to combine cell biology, advanced microscopy and systems biology. In preliminary experiments, tumor cells were recorded using time-resolved 3D multiphoton imaging in living mice and two different protrusion types were observed: a) locomotory protrusions which quickly lead to migration of the tumor cell and b) invasive protrusions, which are persistent and MMP-dependent. The goal of Aim 1 is to investigate the role of invasive protrusions in the tumor cell intravasation and metastasis. A combination of fluorescent reporters will be used for imaging of invasive protrusion assembly and investigation of consequent tumor cell fate. Aim 2 explores signals which drive tumor cells to form either locomotory or invasive protrusions or to switch between behaviors. In areas which contain either locomotory or invasive protrusions, tumor microenvironment parameters are recorded simultaneously (number of macrophages, collagen stiffness, blood vessel size etc.). Imaging analysis results in a data matrix, which is analyzed by a Support Vector Machine classification. Classification shows that tumor cells switch from locomotory to invasive states under very specific conditions. Proposed experiments test the hypothesis that tumor cell behavior can be changed by slightly modifying microenvironment parameters. Relevant microenvironment parameters are incorporated into an integrative mathematical model of the tumor cell switch from locomotory to invasive state, in Aim 3. Using the predictive power of the model, experiments were designed to inhibit the invasive state and subsequent metastasis. Experimental outcomes will be used to optimize and complexify the model. Results of this study will lead to better understanding of the interplay among microenvironment components during tumor progression and the results will be used to improve diagnosis and treatment of early metastasis.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project investigates the underlying mechanisms of tumor cell motility in the context of primary tumor microenvironment. Outcomes will reveal how host environment influences tumor cell entry into the blood vessels (intravasation). Findings will be applied towards new diagnostic and therapeutic markers for early metastasis in breast cancer.        The written critiques and criteria scores of individual reviewers are provided in essentially unedited form in the ""Critique"" section below. Please note that these critiques and criteria scores were prepared prior to the meeting and may not have been revised subsequent to any discussions at the review meeting.

"Objective decision support environment for clinical trials     DESCRIPTION:  Brain tumors are the second- and fifth-most common cause of cancer death in males and females under 40, respectively. The 5-year relative survival rate is only 33%, even after decades of research into new treatments. Imaging based on ""virtual biopsy"" can provide information about the entire lesion in a minimally or non-invasive way. Prior work by our group has demonstrated that image processing methods applied to serial examinations together (as opposed to applying them to individual examinations) can make subtle changes in brain tumors more apparent, allowing earlier detection of progression. We see the union of virtual biopsy methods and change detection methods as an innovative and powerful combination that our team is uniquely qualified to develop and evaluate. In this application, we will implement several feature selection (FS) methods in a tool that is ""image friendly"". This tool will help select informative features from images; apply a wide range of existing ML algorithms to determine which features are important predictors of therapy response, and to evaluate the impact of a decision support application using these features and ML in a clinical trial. The final stage of th proposal will test the decision support tools in 3 clinical scenarios to see if they are able to significantly improve the decision making of clinicians in a clinical trial.  The long-term goal of this proposal is to develop virtual biopsy technology that will enhance the clinical decision making process by providing tools for investigation of image-based therapy response assessment tools, that may also have some ability to predict outcome. We hope to apply the technology to other organ systems and other imaging technologies. We anticipate this project will impact clinical trials by enabling investigation of alternative outcome measures that are objectively assessed using algorithm evaluation methods. Such a toolset should be useful to the entire cancer imaging community to help evaluate features in old and new imaging technologies that correlate with patient survival. As such, this is ideal for helping the Quantitative Imaging Network (QIN) achieve its goals.           The selection of features that reflect response to therapy has long been the domain of the clinical radiologist. When imaging was relatively straightforward (e.g. a chest X-ray of lung cancer), a measurement or a visual assessment was a reasonable metric. Today, advanced imaging devices produce large amounts of data that reflect a range of properties. In this work, we build on previous work developing computer techniques for identifying and characterizing changes in brain tumors, using MRI. In this proposal, we will focus on building 1) a high quality database of brain cancer imaging, clinical data, ""-omic"" data, outcomes data; 2) a library of easily accessed tools for computing features that might be important predictors of tumor response; 3) a tool that will help objectively establish the feature() that are valuable through a variety of machine learning methods; and 4) use the above to create a decision support tool that will be used in 3 clinical trial situations.  .

"Genotype and phenotype predictors in therapy response in renal cell carcinoma  ABSTRACT Therapy of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has been transformed in recent years by the efficacy of targeted agents that inhibit kinases involved in critical cellular signaling pathways and VEGF, a primary driver of tumor angiogenesis. However, patient response to these therapeutics is highly variable and currently cannot be predicted based on clinical or pathological data or available laboratory/genetic testing. The goal of this proposal is to develop predictors of therapeutic response for patients with the most common subtype of RCC, clear cell (ccRCC), based on novel tests. Our approach is based primarily on the hypothesis that the targeted agents used in ccRCC therapy - bevacizumab, sunitinib and sorafenib - inhibit tumor vessel activation and that the activation status and stability of tumor vessels are major determinants of response. We also hypothesize that the phenotype of ccRCC tumor vessels is linked to the molecular pathobiology of the tumor cells. In particular, as these drugs also can inhibit tumor cell signaling and modulate their behavior, ccRCC tumor cell signaling, HIF-1/HIF-2 (hypoxia-inducible factor) expression and VHL function are potential determinants of response. To examine parameters of vascular phenotype, tumor cell phenotype and VHL genotype as predictors of response to therapy, ccRCC specimens will undergo multiplex immunostaining for the appropriate biomarker antigens and be analyzed by a novel computer-assisted image analysis system that objectively quantifies analyte staining on a cellular (cytometric) basis as well as by traditional pixel-based analysis. These studies will be performed on tumors of ccRCC patients treated with single-agent bevacizumab, sunitinib or sorafenib in ongoing multi-institutional phase II (ECOG2804) and phase III (ECOG2805) clinical trials, using tumor blocks from a subset of 90, 170 and 170 appropriate ccRCC patients for therapy with the respective drugs. The specific aims of this proposal are (Aim 1) to analyze the vascular and endothelial cell activation phenotype and vessel pericyte coverage in ccRCC tumors; (Aim 2) to analyze tumor cell signaling, HIF phenotype and VHL genotype in ccRCC tumors; and (Aim 3) to correlate parameters quantified in the prior aims for relationships to each other, to therapeutic outcome and to develop parsimonious predictive models of therapeutic response using biostatistical and bioinformatics approaches. The results of these studies should allow identification of the most appropriate drugs for treating individual patients with ccRCC and assist in the rational development of second-line and combination drug therapies. Beyond ccRCC, the targeted agents under study are used in the therapy of an ever expanding number of cancers, and the response predictors developed for ccRCC, where these agents are best studied because they are used as single-agents, may be useful for predicting response of these other cancers to combination therapy incorporating the targeted agents.  Novel targeted cancer therapy agents have shown success in the treatment of kidney cancer (renal cell carcinoma), a cancer that is increasing in incidence and newly diagnosed in over 50,000 Americans a year. Studies in this project will characterize the tumor blood vessel characteristics and genetic defect of renal cell carcinomas and correlate them with therapeutic response to identify factors that can predict whether they will respond to treatment. Discovering features of kidney cancer that predict therapeutic response can then be used to stratify patients to different therapies in the future and will provide lessons that are likely to be applicable to many other cancers being treated with the same novel drugs.",Genotype and phenotype predictors in therapy response in renal cell carcinoma,8473174,R01CA135509,"['Algorithms ', '

"Reliable Human-Model Observers for Emission Tomography    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our overall objective is to develop numerical observers for dependable technology evaluations in emission tomography. Positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission tomography (SPECT) are the primary clinical modalities for imaging many types of cancer. However, early de- tection often presents the best chances of surviving cancer whereas these imaging modalities have limited diagnostic utility for small tumors. Systematic task-based developmental assessments could facilitate early identification of promising new technology for improving the diagnostic capabilities of these modalities. Yet, assessments with human observers are generally impractical for developmental use. Moreover, available mathematical models (or numerical observers) intended to predict human performance-what we refer to as human-model observers-present significant limits, including con- straints on the types of diagnostic tasks that can be considered. Partly because of these constraints, existing human-model observers frequently require revalidation given any change to the imaging pro- cess. Our approach to observer development is founded on the concept of task equivalence, whereby the task for the numerical observer mirrors the desired clinical task as closely as possible. In this grant, we propose a novel observer framework that is influenced by descriptions of radiologists' visual-search (VS) processes, in which an initial global scan of an image identifies candidate locations deserving closer inspection. We shall use the VS paradigm to investigate the hypotheses that task equivalence i) can lead to a human-observer model that reliably generalizes to a wide range of diagnostic tasks, and ii) is necessary to ensure truly relevant task-based evaluations. We shall test these hypotheses through observer studies with fluorine-18 deoxyglucose (FDG) whole-body PET and SPECT In-111 imaging of neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). A state-of-the-art model observer for developmental stud- ies should be capable of detection-localization tasks, and our observer studies will be analyzed with jackknife FROC (JAFROC) methodology. The specific aims of this work are to: 1) determine what features of FDG-PET image slices attract initial human-observer attention; 2) develop a VS numerical observer for tumor detection-localization tasks in FDG-PET; 3) test the VS observer against humans in a JAFROC detection-localization study featuring hybrid PET images; 4) investigate generalizations of the VS observer to SPECT and 3D detection-localization tasks; and 5) compare system optimiza- tions for oncologic SPECT obtained from the VS and existing numerical observers. The application is optimization of a parallel-hole collimator design for In-111 NET imaging.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Functional imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission tomog- raphy (SPECT) has a significant role in cancer diagnosis and management.

"Systems Biology of Tumor Progression and Drug Resistance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The emergence of multidimensional datasets characterizing genetic, epigenetic, and functional properties of large normal and tumor-related samples is creating unique opportunities for the systems-level dissection of mechanisms associated with malignant phenotypes. Coupled with novel high-throughput technologies and computational methodologies for the dissection, interrogation, and perturbation of genome-wide regulatory pathways, this will lead to highly efficient approaches for the rapid identification and validation of therapeutic targets, their small molecule inhibitors, and associated biomarkers. Columbia University investigators have pioneered systems-biology-based approaches for the dissection of regulatory networks in human malignancies and for their interrogation, using computational, RNAi, and small-molecule approaches, to identify molecular targets for therapeutic intervention. The goal of this project is the use and build upon a successful pipeline between the investigators labs for the discovery and validation of master regulator modules that implement functional bottlenecks that integrate aberrant signals from multiple genetic and epigenetic alterations, and thus, constitute natural dependencies (i.e., Achille's heel) for the tumor subtype. These will be characterized in terms of their synergistic behavior, driver genetic alterations, and druggable modulators. This pipeline will allow processing of a novel tumor phenotype every 18 to 24 months, yielding validated individual and synergistic targets that constitute either oncogene or non-oncogene dependencies of the tumor or that increase sensitivity to existing FDA approved or late-stage development compounds.

"MRI-based mapping of regional genomic diversity in Glioblastoma     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to develop an image-based diagnostic system for Glioblastoma (GBM) that identifies the potential genetic underpinnings of treatment resistance within the zone where tumor almost always recurs. This should facilitate the delivery of individualized care for patients with GBM. Current therapy selection is formulaic and uniform for all patients and does not account for broad genetic diversity that contributes to treatment resistance and dismal prognosis. Specifically, each patient's GBM is uniquely heterogeneous and comprised of multiple distinct subclonal populations with differing susceptibilities to therapy This diversity causes tumors to respond non-uniformly to targeted therapy and allows resistant clones to repopulate as recurrent disease. Additionally, conventional MRI routinely guides surgical resection of enhancing tumor core, but leaves behind tumor populations within adjacent non-enhancing parenchyma, or brain around tumor (BAT). The BAT represents the primary target of adjuvant therapy because it harbors the residual tumor populations that nearly universally recur. Curating the genomic diversity within BAT should inform treatment selection, but this region is almost never biopsied because it is poorly evaluated on conventional MRI. Currently, there is no systematic method that addresses intratumoral heterogeneity to characterize the regional genomic diversity within BAT. To address this critical need, this exploratory proposal will develop and test a novel mapping system that integrates multi-parametric MRI with image-guided tissue analysis and machine learning (ML) algorithms to delineate regional genomic variations in GBM. This system uses conventional MRI to identify major tumoral subcomponents: enhancing core, BAT, and central necrosis. Within these subcomponents, advanced MRI (perfusion, diffusion, texture) will further characterize regional tumor properties (i.e., angiogenesis, permeability, invasion, and proliferation) that represent phenotypic expression of underlying genomic status. These MRI traits will guide stereotactic biopsies from distinct tumoral subregions to generate matched pairs of MRI and genomic data. An ML algorithm will incorporate these data to estimate regional genomic diversity throughout each tumor, including BAT areas that have not been surgically sampled. We have unified a multi-disciplinary team of investigators from institutions that have substantial and long-standing collaborations. Our group offers expertise in multiple fields of study that are necessary to accomplish the research aims, including: 1) image processing and analytics; 2) image-guided stereotactic surgery and coregistration; 3) development of machine learning (ML) methodology; and 4) comprehensive genomic interrogation and cell biology of tumor within BAT. If successful, the work proposed here should significantly impact how GBM patients are diagnosed and treated. This potentially improves clinical outcomes by enabling a paradigm shift from ""one treatment fits all"" to a mutations-based approach that selects combinatorial therapies targeting individual tumor populations.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose here a novel strategy that identifies the potential genetic underpinnings of treatment resistance within the zone where tumor almost always recurs. By developing an image-based mapping system that characterizes regionally diverse populations within individual tumors, the proposed exploratory work will facilitate the development of improved targeted combinatorial therapies as the basis for future work in an R01 application.             ",MRI-based mapping of regional genomic diversity in Glioblastoma,8490147,R21NS082609,"['Accounting ', ' Algorithms ', ' Biopsy ', ' Hemato-Encephalic Barrier ', ' Blood-Brain Barrier ', ' Blood - brain barrier anatomy ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diffusion ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Exhibits ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' spongioblastoma multiforme ', ' glioblastoma multiforme ', ' Grade IV Astrocytoma ', ' Grade IV Astrocytic Tumor ', ' Grade IV Astrocytic Neoplasm ', ' Glioblastoma ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' Necrotic ', ' Necrosis ', ' Patients ', ' Perfusion ', ' Permeability ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Publishing ', ' irradiation injury ', ' Radiation Injuries ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' allelic variant ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Gene variant ', ' Variation (Genetics) ', ' War ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Drug Delivery ', ' Drug Delivery Systems ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Selection for Treatments ', ' Killings ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' cancer progression ', ' tumor progression ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' prognostic ', ' Individual ', ' Relapsed Disease ', ' Recurrent disease ', ' Collaborations ', ' angiogenesis ', ' Genetic ', ' Diagnostic ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Texture ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' residual disease ', ' Residual Tumors ', ' Comparative Genome Hybridization ', ' comparative genomic hybridization ', ' field study ', ' tumor growth ', ' cohort ', ' trait ', ' Adjuvant Therapy ', ' novel ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' Excision ', ' ray (radiation) ', ' Radiation ', ' Sampling ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' Genomics ', ' Institution ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Tumor Cell Biology ', ' Validation ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' resistant ', ' Resistance ', ' combinatorial ', ' chemotherapy ', ' tumor ', ' public health relevance ', ' treatment response ', ' IRBs ', ' Institutional Review Boards ', ' ']",NINDS,MAYO CLINIC ARIZONA,R21,2013,305251,AZ-06,0.1614737484266571
"UCSC-Buck Inst. Genome Data Analysis Center for TCGA Research Network (GDAC) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project holds promise for a comprehensive understanding of human cancer through the application of genomic technologies. However, current cancer genomic analytical and visualization technologies still have many limitations that will likely prevent investigators from taking full advantage of this resource. The proposed UCSC-Buck Institute Genome Data Analysis Center will support an integrative analysis of TCGA data for all surveyed cancer types throughout the project. The major components of the pipeline are a pathway-centric multi-layer machine learning tool called Biolntegrator, a genome rearrangement detector for next-gen sequencing data, and the tightly coupled UCSC browser tool suite. We aim to detect cancer-associated molecular alterations and the biological pathways that are perturbed by them in tumor samples. Samples will then be classified into clinically relevant categories based on pathway perturbations rather than perturbations of individual genes, which we believe will be more robust, biologically meaningful and clinically accurate. Using Biolntegrator and the associated tools, we will further integrate TCGA data with datasets from external studies, including cell line studies, animal studies and clinical trials, to identify (1) cancer-associated molecular alterations; (2) dysregulated pathways and signatures useful in clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and drug response prediction; and (3) gene targets for the development of novel therapeutics. These results will provide the basis for a refined patient stratification in therapy and will generate new hypotheses for translational research. The tightly coupled UCSC browser suite, which will be enhanced to accommodate the needs of the TCGA project, includes the UCSC Cancer Genomics Browser for visualizing TCGA cancer genomics, clinical data, and analysis results; the UCSC Tumor Browser for displaying tumor genome rearrangements and other tumor mutations; and the UCSC Human Genome Browser for integrating the data with human genome annotations and information gleaned from other projects such as ENCODE and the NIH Epigenomics Roadmap Initiative. The browser resource, hosting this rapidly growing body of cancer genomics data, will enable investigators to perform interactive in-silico experiments to test new hypotheses derived from the TCGA data. Collectively, these proposed tools will enable cancer researchers to better explore the breadth and depth of the TCGA resources and to further characterize molecular pathways that influence cellular dynamics and stability in cancer. Ultimately, insights gained by applying these tools will advance our knowledge of human cancer biology and stimulate the discovery of new prognostic and diagnostic markers, leading to new therapeutic and preventative strategies. The UCSC-Buck Institute Cancer Genome Data Analysis Center aims to analyze the TCGA project data to  identify (1) cancer-associated molecular alterations; (2) dysregulated pathway signatures that can be used in  clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and drug response prediction; and (3) candidate gene targets for the  development of novel therapeutics.

"Biomarkers for Staging and Treatment Response Monitoring of Bladder Cancer     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Bladder cancer is a common type of cancer that can cause substantial morbidity and mortality among both men and women. Bladder cancer causes over 15,210 deaths per year in the United States. It is estimated that 72,570 new bladder cancer cases will be diagnosed in 2013. Correct staging of the bladder cancer is crucial for the decision of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and minimizing the risk of under-treatment or over-treatment. A reliable assessment of the response to neoadjuvant therapy at an early stage is vital for identifying tumors that do not respond and allowing the patient a chance of alternative treatment. MRI and CT are important methods for pre-treatment staging or treatment response monitoring for a variety of bladder cancers. CT is an effective non-invasive modality for measuring primary site gross tumor volume (GTV) and the addition of MRI is on the rise. GTV has been used as a biomarker for predicting treatment outcome of bladder tumors. Other pathological information and diagnostic test (bimanual evaluation, cystoscopy) results and immunohistochemical biomarkers are also useful for staging and treatment response monitoring. The goal of this project is to develop effective decision support tools that merge image-based and non-image-based biomarkers to assist radiologists and oncologists in assessment of cancer stage and change as a result of treatment. We will (1) develop a quantitative image analysis tool (QIBC) for bladder GTV estimation on multi-modality (MM) images, (2) develop a computer decision support system (CDSS-S) to assist clinicians in cancer staging, (3) develop a computer decision support system (CDSS-T) to assist clinicians in evaluation of the change in the tumor characteristics as a result of neoadjuvant treatment, (4) evaluate the effects of QIBC and CDSS-T on inter-clinician variability and efficiency in estimation of GTV and treatment response, and (5) evaluate CDSS-S and CDSS-T as decision support tools in pilot clinical studies. We hypothesize that the use of QIBC, CDSS-S and CDSS-T can improve the clinicians' accuracy, consistency and efficiency in bladder GTV estimation on MM imaging exams, the assessment of bladder cancer stage and response to treatment. To test our hypothesis, we will perform the following specific tasks: (1) to collect a database of multi-modality MR, CT exams of bladder cancers for development, training and testing of the QIBC and CDSS algorithms; (2) to develop advanced computer vision techniques to quantitatively estimate bladder GTV and image characteristics; (3) to develop predictive models using machine learning techniques to combine MM image-based, pathological and immunohistochemical biomarkers for cancer staging and determination of non-responders; (4) to compare the inter-clinician variability and efficiency in clinicians' estimation of GTV and treatment response with and without the proposed QIBC and CDSS-T by observer studies; and (5) to evaluate the CDSS-S and CDSS-T as decision support tools in pilot clinical studies.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: If successfully developed, the CDSS-S and CDSS-T can serve as non-invasive, objective, and reproducible clinical decision support systems for cancer staging and treatment response monitoring. Correct staging of the bladder cancer is crucial for the decision of chemotherapy treatment and minimizing the risk of under-treatment or over-treatment. If the response to chemotherapy can be estimated accurately it is possible to identify those patients that do not respond, stop the treatment early, and seek alternative treatment. In addition, although we will focus on the specific application to the bladder tumors in this proposed project, we will design the decision support tools in a modular, expandable, and re-trainable framework. The software package will be versatile and is adaptable to other tumor types or imaging modalities in the future by proper retraining with case samples of the tumor type of interest and expansion of the decision support tools as needed. Therefore, the development of the CDSS-S and CDSS-T will potentially benefit not only the bladder tumor patients but also patients with other tumor types that require staging and monitoring of treatment response.            ",Biomarkers for Staging and Treatment Response Monitoring of Bladder Cancer,8697721,U01CA179106,"['NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Minor ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' muscular ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' Muscle ', ' Necrotic ', ' Necrosis ', ' Tumor Staging ', ' Neoplasm Staging ', ' Cancer Staging ', ' Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' urogenital system (urinary part) ', ' Urogenital System ', ' Urogenital ', ' Genitourinary ', ' Genitourinary system ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Biochemical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Oncologist ', ' RDST ', ' radiologist ', ' Descriptor ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Texture ', ' Techniques ', ' Test Result ', ' Head and Neck ', ' Head and neck structure ', ' Tumor Volume ', ' Tumor Tissue ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' palpable disease ', ' Palpable ', ' Clinical Decision Support Systems ', ' interest ', ' Neoadjuvant Treatment ', ' Neoadjuvant ', ' NEOADJ ', ' Induction Therapy ', ' Neoadjuvant Therapy ', ' novel ', ' Modality ', ' Sampling ', ' Decision Support Systems ', ' response ', ' cancer location ', ' cancer site ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer therapy ', ' Institution ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Lymphovascular ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' computerized ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' cancer type ', ' prospective ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' early therapy ', ' Early treatment ', ' caBIG ', ' cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid ', ' open source ', ' computer monitor ', ' chemotherapy ', ' tumor ', ' public health relevance ', ' multimodality ', ' alternative treatment ', ' treatment response ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' oncology program ', ' post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' Aftercare ', ' Algorithms ', ' urinary bladder ', ' Bladder Urinary System ', ' Bladder ', ' Urinary Bladder Malignant Tumor ', ' Urinary Bladder Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Bladder ', ' Malignant Bladder Neoplasm ', ' Bladder Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder ', ' Urinary Bladder Tumor ', ' Urinary Bladder Neoplasm ', ' Bladder Tumors ', ' Bladder Neoplasm ', ' Breast ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' in situ cancer ', ' Preinvasive Carcinoma ', ' Intraepithelial Carcinoma ', ' Carcinoma in Situ ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' computer vision ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' Computers ', ' Cystoscopy ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' indexing ', ' Interobserver Variations ', ' Inter-Observer Variation ', ' Inter-Observer Variability ', ' Interobserver Variability ', ' Libraries ', ' Nodular Lymphoma ', ' Giant Follicular Lymphoma ', "" Follicular Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma "", ' Follicle Center Lymphoma ', ' Brill-Symmers Disease ', ' Follicular Lymphoma ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2014,501194,MI-12,0.09527429587435889
"Quantitative Analysis of GBM Invasion Mechanisms with New Imaging Protocol     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glioblastoma (GBM, WHO grade IV) is the most common and highest-grade astrocytoma with uniformly dismal prognosis. In contrast to the lower grade gliomas (grades II and III), GBMs present radial growth rates almost 10 times as fast. Three pathophysiologic features, including necrosis, cellular pseudopalisades surrounding necrosis, and microvascular hyperplasia, are considered as hallmarks for GBM prognosis and are believed to be relevant to the drastically accelerated disease progression. Additionally, a population of Glioma Stem Cells (GCSs) has been found pertinent to the new neovascular formation, leading to GBM tumor outward growth. However, the definitive roles of these pathologic features and the associated signaling networks in GBM progression and their interactive mechanisms remain ill defined, because of limited capacity of biomarker observation and data analysis. The proposed project will create a new avenue for GBM research by leveraging computational power and machine intelligence for analyses of large-scale pathology images and spatially referenced, multiplexed biomarker data. A comprehensive system and analytical infrastructure will be developed to quantitatively investigate 1) spatial distributions f GBM invasion-related pathologic structures and GSCs, 2) functions of the in-situ signaling genes and regulatory networks responsible for GBM progression, and 3) the significance of morphologic, molecular, and signaling network variation across GBM microenvironments. A set of scalable image processing algorithms for analyses of spatial distributions and co-localizations of phenotypic features and biomarkers will be developed and applied to whole-slide pathology brightfield and quantum dot immunohistochemistry images of GBMs. Derived features and boundaries of phenotypic structures, and spatial distributions of biomarkers will be archived and integrated in a database for pathology and in-situ molecular imaging data where scientific queries can be invoked to support the analysis of GBM tumor progression mechanisms. In particular, multiplexed quantum dot immunohistochemistry (mQD-IHC), a new biomarker staining technique, will be leveraged to show the locations and expressions of multiple biomarkers of interest within the same tissue spatial reference. The combined expertise in large-scale pathology image process, high performance data computation, mQD-IHC staining technique for multiplexed biomarker investigation, and phenotype- genotype data integration supported by high-throughput data query power from customized database enables a unique research vehicle to investigate GBM tumor expansion mechanisms. Notably, the proposed research work can be generalized to catalyze other computational cancer research involving large-scale data and phenotype-genotype information integration. Therefore, it will present a broad impact on future translational research.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Integrated analysis of spatial configurations of tissue pathologic features and underlying molecular biomarkers accounting for cancer progression is an important way to understand tumor expansion mechanisms. To advance in this research field, I propose to develop automated image analysis tools, database-based spatial integration methods, and mathematical models for tumor microenvironment representation to support quantitative investigations on Glioblastoma (GBM) brain tumor invasion mechanisms with definitive pathology imaging and multiplexed molecular biomarker data from whole-slide images of GBM specimens.            ",Quantitative Analysis of GBM Invasion Mechanisms with New Imaging Protocol,8618183,K25CA181503,"['Accounting ', ' Algorithms ', ' Archives ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Astroglioma ', ' Astrocytic Tumor ', ' Astrocytic Neoplasm ', ' Astrocytic Glioma ', ' Astrocytoma ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' vascular ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' tumors in the brain ', ' Brain Tumors ', ' Brain Neoplasia ', ' Brain Neoplasms ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Cells ', ' Computers ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Future ', ' trans acting element ', ' regulatory gene ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' genetic biomarker ', ' Genetic Markers ', ' Genotype ', ' spongioblastoma multiforme ', ' glioblastoma multiforme ', ' Grade IV Astrocytoma ', ' Grade IV Astrocytic Tumor ', ' Grade IV Astrocytic Neoplasm ', ' Glioblastoma ', ' neuroglia tumor ', ' neuroglia neoplasm ', ' glial-derived tumor ', ' Neuroglial Tumor ', ' Neuroglial Neoplasm ', ' Glial Tumor ', ' Glial Neoplasm ', ' Glial Cell Tumors ', ' Glioma ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Hyperplastic ', ' Hyperplasia ', ' Immunohistochemistry Staining Method ', ' Immunohistochemistry Cell/Tissue ', ' Immunohistochemistry ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' Information Systems ', ' Math ', ' Mathematics ', ' Methods ', ' Necrotic ', ' Necrosis ', ' Pathology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Solutions ', ' Spatial Distribution ', ' Stains ', ' Progenitor Cells ', ' Stem cells ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' transcription factor ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Brain ', ' Brain Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of brain ', ' base ', ' density ', ' image processing ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' cancer progression ', ' tumor progression ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Training ', ' Oxygen Deficiency ', ' Hypoxic ', ' Hypoxia ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Measurement ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Cell Structure ', ' Cell Components ', ' Cellular Structures ', ' Tissue Stains ', ' angiogenesis ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' Investigation ', ' Radius ', ' Radial ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Slide ', ' In Situ ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Stainings ', ' Staining method ', ' Hematoxylin and Eosin ', ' H and E ', ' Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method ', ' interest ', ' data management ', ' Tumor Cell ', ' neoplastic cell ', ' Performance ', ' computer science ', ' Informatics ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Property ', ' high throughput technology ', ' high throughput analysis ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematic model ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematical model ', ' Genomics ', ' protein expression ', ' Q-Dot ', ' Quantum Dots ', ' Tumor Invasion ', ' Tumor Cell Invasion ', ' Data ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Resolution ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' Tumor Expansion ', ' Pathologic ', ' Molecular ', ' molecular imaging ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' cancer microenvironment ', ' tumor microenvironment ', ' neovascular ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' data modeling ', ' digital ', ' data integration ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' migration ', ' tumor ', ' spatial integration ', ' public health relevance ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' relational database ', ' ']",NCI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K25,2014,116888,GA-05,0.10462380068979374
"MRI-based mapping of regional genomic diversity in Glioblastoma     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to develop an image-based diagnostic system for Glioblastoma (GBM) that identifies the potential genetic underpinnings of treatment resistance within the zone where tumor almost always recurs. This should facilitate the delivery of individualized care for patients with GBM. Current therapy selection is formulaic and uniform for all patients and does not account for broad genetic diversity that contributes to treatment resistance and dismal prognosis. Specifically, each patient's GBM is uniquely heterogeneous and comprised of multiple distinct subclonal populations with differing susceptibilities to therapy This diversity causes tumors to respond non-uniformly to targeted therapy and allows resistant clones to repopulate as recurrent disease. Additionally, conventional MRI routinely guides surgical resection of enhancing tumor core, but leaves behind tumor populations within adjacent non-enhancing parenchyma, or brain around tumor (BAT). The BAT represents the primary target of adjuvant therapy because it harbors the residual tumor populations that nearly universally recur. Curating the genomic diversity within BAT should inform treatment selection, but this region is almost never biopsied because it is poorly evaluated on conventional MRI. Currently, there is no systematic method that addresses intratumoral heterogeneity to characterize the regional genomic diversity within BAT. To address this critical need, this exploratory proposal will develop and test a novel mapping system that integrates multi-parametric MRI with image-guided tissue analysis and machine learning (ML) algorithms to delineate regional genomic variations in GBM. This system uses conventional MRI to identify major tumoral subcomponents: enhancing core, BAT, and central necrosis. Within these subcomponents, advanced MRI (perfusion, diffusion, texture) will further characterize regional tumor properties (i.e., angiogenesis, permeability, invasion, and proliferation) that represent phenotypic expression of underlying genomic status. These MRI traits will guide stereotactic biopsies from distinct tumoral subregions to generate matched pairs of MRI and genomic data. An ML algorithm will incorporate these data to estimate regional genomic diversity throughout each tumor, including BAT areas that have not been surgically sampled. We have unified a multi-disciplinary team of investigators from institutions that have substantial and long-standing collaborations. Our group offers expertise in multiple fields of study that are necessary to accomplish the research aims, including: 1) image processing and analytics; 2) image-guided stereotactic surgery and coregistration; 3) development of machine learning (ML) methodology; and 4) comprehensive genomic interrogation and cell biology of tumor within BAT. If successful, the work proposed here should significantly impact how GBM patients are diagnosed and treated. This potentially improves clinical outcomes by enabling a paradigm shift from ""one treatment fits all"" to a mutations-based approach that selects combinatorial therapies targeting individual tumor populations.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose here a novel strategy that identifies the potential genetic underpinnings of treatment resistance within the zone where tumor almost always recurs. By developing an image-based mapping system that characterizes regionally diverse populations within individual tumors, the proposed exploratory work will facilitate the development of improved targeted combinatorial therapies as the basis for future work in an R01 application.             ",MRI-based mapping of regional genomic diversity in Glioblastoma,8620732,R21NS082609,"['Accounting ', ' Algorithms ', ' Biopsy ', ' Hemato-Encephalic Barrier ', ' Blood-Brain Barrier ', ' Blood - brain barrier anatomy ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diffusion ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Exhibits ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' spongioblastoma multiforme ', ' glioblastoma multiforme ', ' Grade IV Astrocytoma ', ' Grade IV Astrocytic Tumor ', ' Grade IV Astrocytic Neoplasm ', ' Glioblastoma ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' Necrotic ', ' Necrosis ', ' Patients ', ' Perfusion ', ' Permeability ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Publishing ', ' irradiation injury ', ' Radiation Injuries ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Variation (Genetics) ', ' War ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Drug Delivery ', ' Drug Delivery Systems ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Selection for Treatments ', ' Killings ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' cancer progression ', ' tumor progression ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' prognostic ', ' Individual ', ' Relapsed Disease ', ' Recurrent disease ', ' Collaborations ', ' angiogenesis ', ' Genetic ', ' Diagnostic ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Texture ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' residual disease ', ' Residual Tumors ', ' Comparative Genome Hybridization ', ' comparative genomic hybridization ', ' field study ', ' tumor growth ', ' cohort ', ' trait ', ' Adjuvant Therapy ', ' novel ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' Excision ', ' ray (radiation) ', ' Radiation ', ' Sampling ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' Genomics ', ' Institution ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Tumor Cell Biology ', ' Validation ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' resistant ', ' Resistance ', ' combinatorial ', ' chemotherapy ', ' tumor ', ' public health relevance ', ' treatment response ', ' IRBs ', ' Institutional Review Boards ', ' ']",NINDS,MAYO CLINIC ARIZONA,R21,2014,219825,AZ-06,0.1614737484266571
"Predicting brain tumor progression via multiparametric image analysis and modelin     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High-grade brain gliomas, the most common of which is glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), have terrible prognosis and a median patient survival of about 12 months. Although combinations of surgical removal, radiotherapy and chemotherapy are used in the clinical practice, a  fundamental and persistent limitation in treating these aggressive tumors is that they tend to  infiltrate into normal tissue well beyond margins visible via imaging. Since assessing the spatial  extent of tumor infiltration is nearly impossible using current radiologic reading practices, clinical  treatment tends to be restricted to parts that are deemed to be clearly malignant, frequently only  the enhancing tumor. This failure to aggressively treat the infiltrating tumor accelerates tumor  recurrence, and eventually patient death. This proposal aims to develop computational modeling  and image analysis methods that will improve our ability to estimate GBM infiltration, as well as  to predict tissue that is likelyto present fastest tumor recurrence, thereby eventually opening the  way for more aggressive, yet targeted, treatment, such as targeted aggressive surgical removal  and/or radiosurgery. To achieve our goal, we will integrate information from several sources:  1)  advanced multi-parametric imaging, which captures many aspects of tumor anatomy and  physiology~ 2) computational modeling of tumor growth and infiltration~ 3) machine learning  methods which, after appropriate training, can learn subtle and potentially complex imaging  phenotypes of infiltrating tumors~ 4) statistical atlases, which capture population-based trends  that can offer additional insights into tumor growth, such as relationship of infiltration to  vasculature and to white matter fiber pathways~ 5) data from one of the largest patient  populations having advanced imaging, genotyping, follow-up till tumor recurrence, and  histological analysis.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop advance computational imaging and informatics methods for analysis  of high-grade gliomas (brain tumors). It will compile a unique database of data from several  hundred patients and will construct predictive models of infiltrating malignant tumor and of later  recurrence.

"Dynamic-CT-based biomarker for predicting clinical outcome in CRC DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States and is responsible for significant morbidity and mortality. A patient's five-year survival rate depend on the tumor stage at the time of diagnosis, and stage of the tumor plays a substantial role in decision-making regarding treatment. Thus, precise pre-treatment diagnostic evaluation and staging of colorectal cancer are important. In addition, angiogenesis plays an important role in the process of growth and metastasis in CRC and is reported as a useful prognostic marker, similar to many other carcinomas. Thus, in vivo quantification of the tumor angiogenesis rate holds promise in improving the management of CRC. Perfusion computed tomography (PCT) acquires high temporal resolution images, thus enabling evaluation of hemodynamic changes of tissue in vivo by modeling tracer kinetics. PCT has been reported to characterize tumor angiogenesis, and to be a more sensitive imaging biomarker for predicting of overall survival (OS) of CRC patients than conventional tumor staging. In clinical practice, however, the PCT protocol is a trade-off between high-temporal resolution and the total radiation dose required. Thus, the use of dynamic CT imaging derived from four temporal phases, which include pre-contrast, arterial, portal, and delayed phases, is highly desirable, because it is more readily available and yields substantially lower radiation exposure to the patients than that of PCT. However, low temporal resolution in four-phase dynamic CT presents several barriers in modeling tracer kinetics, primarily because of the lack of temporal enhancement information, which limits the ability to obtain reliable physiological information. We will thus develop a novel continuous-time modeling of tracer kinetics without any discretization of the enhancement curves. Such an approach will enable estimation of the time lag between onset time points of input and response enhancements as well as other kinetic parameters in four-phase dynamic CT. We hypothesize that the proposed tracer kinetic model can be an effective imaging biomarker for the risk stratification of recurrence of CRC and for prediction of OS. To explore these hypotheses, the specific aims of the proposed project are (1) Develop a novel single-input continuous-time tracer kinetic model without any discretization to fit  temporal enhancement curves in four-phase dynamic CT of the colon, and (2) develop kinetic-model-based imaging biomarkers from four-phase dynamic CT and evaluate their performance in predicting clinical outcome in CRC patients. Successful development of a novel imaging biomarker based on four-phase dynamic CT holds high promise for the development of tailor-made optimal therapy without excessive radiation exposure to the patient. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful development of a novel imaging biomarker based on four-phase dynamic CT holds high promise for the development of tailor-made optimal therapy without excessive radiation exposure to the patient. Using such a biomarker to optimize therapy will provide patients with more effective treatment, thus reducing side effects associated with unnecessary therapeutic regimens. In addition, use of this biomarker may result in cost savings in treatment by reducing frequency of follow-up examinations in patients with a low risk of recurrence.",Dynamic-CT-based biomarker for predicting clinical outcome in CRC,8757781,R21CA187877,"['Accounting ', ' abdominal aorta ', ' epithelial carcinoma ', ' Malignant Epithelial Tumors ', ' Malignant Epithelial Neoplasms ', ' Carcinoma ', ' Colon ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' hemodynamics ', ' Kinetics ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' tumor cell metastasis ', ' cancer metastasis ', ' Tumor Cell Migration ', ' Secondary Tumor ', ' Secondary Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Tumor ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm ', ' Metastasize ', ' Metastasis ', ' Neoplasm Metastasis ', ' Tumor Staging ', ' Neoplasm Staging ', ' Cancer Staging ', ' Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Perfusion ', ' Play ', ' wave (radiation) ', ' Radiation-Total ', ' Electromagnetic Waves ', ' Electromagnetic Radiation ', ' Electromagnetic Energy ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Solutions ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' computerized tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' catscan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' EMI scan ', ' Computerized Axial Tomography (Computerized Tomography) ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' CT scan ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CAT scan ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' United States ', ' Generations ', ' Cost Savings ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Residual ', ' Residual state ', ' Phase ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Fourier Transform ', ' Therapeutic ', ' angiogenesis ', ' Exposure to ', ' Staging ', ' Diagnostic ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Performance ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' ray (radiation) ', ' Radiation ', ' Modeling ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Adverse effects ', ' T-Stage ', ' Tumor stage ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Bolus ', ' Bolus Infusion ', ' prognostic indicator ', ' prognostic biomarker ', ' Prognosis Marker ', ' Molecular Marker of Prognosis ', ' Prognostic Marker ', ' Resolution ', ' Stratification ', ' in vivo ', ' in vivo Model ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Tumor Angiogenesis ', ' Process ', ' Tracer ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Outcome ', ' computer algorithm ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' clinical practice ', ' Regimen ', ' ']",NCI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R21,2014,227070,MA-08,0.06735272581427347

"Integrative Cancer Genomics: Drivers, Pathways and Drugs     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The emergence of cancer genomics, combined with increased understanding of the molecular basis of oncogenesis, has stimulated hope that treatment will improve by becoming more targeted and individualized in nature. Cancer genomics studies established a number of critical cancer genes, leading to a number of successful targeted therapies (e.g. Gleevec, Herceptin and Plexxikon). Despite these successes, most cancers do not have a targeted therapy and when one exists, response is highly variable, even among patients that share the targeted mutation and tumor type. To move cancer into the era of personalized therapies, it becomes important to identify the alterations driving tumor progression in each tumor, determine the network that links these aberrations, and identify factors that predict sensitivity to targeted therapies. As projects such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) amass cancer cell genomes at a breathtaking pace, a staggering genetic complexity is revealed. To interpret cancer genomes, a key computational challenge is to separate the wheat from the chaff and define both what are the key alterations likely to be functionally driving cancer and then, after defining such genes, begin to identify mechanisms of action and therapeutic implications. Leveraging components from our published methods, CONEXIC (Akavia et.al Cell 2010) and LirNet (Lee et.al, PLOS Gen 2009), we will develop machine-learning algorithms that integrate cancer genomic data to do just that. We will apply the methods we develop to melanoma, glioblastoma, ovarian, breast and colon cancer and experimentally follow up on our computational findings, towards a better understanding of each of these deadly cancers. The approaches developed in this grant will accelerate discovery to rapidly extract the maximal value from modern genomic studies and help carry cancer genomics from the diagnostic to the therapeutic realm.          This work aims to develop methods that help dissect the genetic complexity of individual cancers. For each tumor we aim to identify which mutations arm a cell with the abilities to abnormally grow or evade drug treatment, providing a foundation of tools towards personalized cancer treatment. We will apply these methods for discovery in some of the most aggressive cancers that currently lack good therapeutic solutions including glioblastoma, ovarian cancer and melanoma.

"Quantitative PET/CT Analysis to Improve Evaluation of Tumor Response     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose to develop and validate a quantitative Positron Emission Tomography / Computed Tomography (PET/CT) image analysis framework to improve the evaluation of esophageal tumor response to chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer. In Aim 1, we will extract comprehensive spatial and temporal features of a tumor from PET/CT images and evaluate their ability in predicting tumor response to CRT. These features will quantify the spatial characteristics of a tumor along with their changes due to CRT, adding a great amount of information to the current non-volumetric PET/CT response measures. Also, we will use image registration techniques to align pre-CRT images with post-CRT images, making it possible to quantify the spatial changes at the original tumor site. In Aim 2, we will construct and test reliable predictive models of tumo response to CRT using machine learning techniques with spatial- temporal PET/CT features, clinical parameters and demographics as input. The models will identify an optimal subset of predictive features and utilize PET and CT information in chorus. In Aim 3, we will develop a novel multi-modality adaptive region-growing algorithm for tumor delineation in PET/CT. We will compare the accuracy and precision of the resulting predictive models against those in which tumor is delineated using conventional methods (manual contouring or thresholding). This comparison will help us understand to what degree the prediction of tumor response depends on the tumor delineation methods. Finally, we will use pathologic response and survival as the end points and ground truth to cross-validate each predictive model. If all aims are achieved, the proposed PET/CT image analysis framework may provide a highly accurate diagnostic tool. This, will complement other diagnostic tests in assisting physicians in making a treatment decision to more appropriately select patients for surgery, thus avoiding the mortality and morbidity of surgery in responders for whom surgery can be safely deferred; while improving local control and survival in non- responders for whom surgery should be considered. Therefore, this work has the potential to improve outcomes by safely deferring surgery which will improve our locally advanced esophageal cancer patient's quality of life while simultaneously reducing costs.

"Systems microscopy analysis of tumor cell motility in microenvironment context DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Candidate: Majoring as analytical chemist during the time in Belgrade, Serbia, Dr. Gligorijevic has become an expert in optics and live cell microscopy over the course of her graduate training at Georgetown University and developed several novel microscopy-based technologies. During the postdoctoral period, Dr. Gligorijevic has focused on studying tumor cell intravasation in breast tumors, in living animals. To do so, she introduced several advancements into in vivo multiphoton microscopy. Dr. Gligorijevic is funded by DOD and Charles Revson Fellowship and has received several honors for her research. Her work to date resulted in one patent, ten peer-reviewed and ten other publications. Recent research has shown that different components of tumor microenvironment have an essential role in tumor progression. In order to decipher the network of interactions which shape the tumor environment and determine tumor cell behavior, it is ideal to apply systems biology approaches combined with in vivo microscopy, as cell cultures are limited in their complexity, mouse models are time-consuming and expensive and in silico models need optimization based on experiments. During the mentored phase of the Award, Dr. Gligorijevic will incorporate the relevant principles of advanced statistics and mathematical modeling of dynamical systems into her background of tumor biology and microscopy. She will take coursework offered at Einstein and meet regularly with her sponsor and co-sponsor. This training will make it possible to build a laboratory which investigates mechanisms of metastasis using the integrative, systems microscopy approach and utilizing information from molecular to population levels.  Environment: Sponsor of the PI, Dr. John Condeelis is a Co-Chair of Anatomy Department and Biophotonic Center at Einstein. His lab and the Center create a multidisciplinary environment focused on answering mechanisms of human diseases, such as cancer, through use of microscopy. The Center is well known for its shared imaging resources and Innovation Laboratory where new microscopy systems are custom-built to accommodate specific needs of different projects. Consulting member of Advisory Committee, Dr. Robert Singer, is an expert in combining experimental and theoretical biology and a renowned mentor. The co-sponsor, Dr. Aviv Bergman, is the Founding Chair of Systems Department at Einstein and teaches coursework which will be a part of the career development. Einstein is an institution which highly values collaboration and insists on career development of postdoctoral fellows, instructors and junior faculty.  Research: While most research of tumor microenvironments focuses on isolating and understanding single parameters, an integrative, systems-level network of interactions among relevant biological players is missing. In primary tumors, there are numerous biomechanical signals able to direct tumor cell movement towards and into the blood vessels. Growth factors, secreted by host macrophages, fibroblasts and endothelial cells in the tumor microenvironment are the main chemoattractants but recent studies show that the extracellular matrix also plays an important role. In loose extracellular matrix, tumor cells can migrate by reorganizing their cytoskeleton, generating a protrusive force. In regions with stiff extracellular matrix, simple locomotion is not possible. Here, tumor cells become invasive and degrade extracellular matrix, mainly by matrix metalloproteases (MMPs). Tumor cell migration was well characterized in vivo, but the mechanism of the switch from locomotory to invasive state and assembly of invasive protrusions in vivo are unknown. To address the link between integrated microenvironment signaling and the tumor cell behavior, it is necessary to combine cell biology, advanced microscopy and systems biology. In preliminary experiments, tumor cells were recorded using time-resolved 3D multiphoton imaging in living mice and two different protrusion types were observed: a) locomotory protrusions which quickly lead to migration of the tumor cell and b) invasive protrusions, which are persistent and MMP-dependent. The goal of Aim 1 is to investigate the role of invasive protrusions in the tumor cell intravasation and metastasis. A combination of fluorescent reporters will be used for imaging of invasive protrusion assembly and investigation of consequent tumor cell fate. Aim 2 explores signals which drive tumor cells to form either locomotory or invasive protrusions or to switch between behaviors. In areas which contain either locomotory or invasive protrusions, tumor microenvironment parameters are recorded simultaneously (number of macrophages, collagen stiffness, blood vessel size etc.). Imaging analysis results in a data matrix, which is analyzed by a Support Vector Machine classification. Classification shows that tumor cells switch from locomotory to invasive states under very specific conditions. Proposed experiments test the hypothesis that tumor cell behavior can be changed by slightly modifying microenvironment parameters. Relevant microenvironment parameters are incorporated into an integrative mathematical model of the tumor cell switch from locomotory to invasive state, in Aim 3. Using the predictive power of the model, experiments were designed to inhibit the invasive state and subsequent metastasis. Experimental outcomes will be used to optimize and complexify the model. Results of this study will lead to better understanding of the interplay among microenvironment components during tumor progression and the results will be used to improve diagnosis and treatment of early metastasis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project investigates the underlying mechanisms of tumor cell motility in the context of primary tumor microenvironment. Outcomes will reveal how host environment influences tumor cell entry into the blood vessels (intravasation). Findings will be applied towards new diagnostic and therapeutic markers for early metastasis in breast cancer.",Systems microscopy analysis of tumor cell motility in microenvironment

"Objective decision support environment for clinical trials     DESCRIPTION:  Brain tumors are the second- and fifth-most common cause of cancer death in males and females under 40, respectively. The 5-year relative survival rate is only 33%, even after decades of research into new treatments. Imaging based on ""virtual biopsy"" can provide information about the entire lesion in a minimally or non-invasive way. Prior work by our group has demonstrated that image processing methods applied to serial examinations together (as opposed to applying them to individual examinations) can make subtle changes in brain tumors more apparent, allowing earlier detection of progression. We see the union of virtual biopsy methods and change detection methods as an innovative and powerful combination that our team is uniquely qualified to develop and evaluate. In this application, we will implement several feature selection (FS) methods in a tool that is ""image friendly"". This tool will help select informative features from images; apply a wide range of existing ML algorithms to determine which features are important predictors of therapy response, and to evaluate the impact of a decision support application using these features and ML in a clinical trial. The final stage of th proposal will test the decision support tools in 3 clinical scenarios to see if they are able to significantly improve the decision making of clinicians in a clinical trial.  The long-term goal of this proposal is to develop virtual biopsy technology that will enhance the clinical decision making process by providing tools for investigation of image-based therapy response assessment tools, that may also have some ability to predict outcome. We hope to apply the technology to other organ systems and other imaging technologies. We anticipate this project will impact clinical trials by enabling investigation of alternative outcome measures that are objectively assessed using algorithm evaluation methods. Such a toolset should be useful to the entire cancer imaging community to help evaluate features in old and new imaging technologies that correlate with patient survival. As such, this is ideal for helping the Quantitative Imaging Network (QIN) achieve its goals.           The selection of features that reflect response to therapy has long been the domain of the clinical radiologist. When imaging was relatively straightforward (e.g. a chest X-ray of lung cancer), a measurement or a visual assessment was a reasonable metric. Today, advanced imaging devices produce large amounts of data that reflect a range of properties. In this work, we build on previous work developing computer techniques for identifying and characterizing changes in brain tumors, using MRI. In this proposal, we will focus on building 1) a high quality database of brain cancer imaging, clinical data, ""-omic"" data, outcomes data; 2) a library of easily accessed tools for computing features that might be important predictors of tumor response; 3) a tool that will help objectively establish the feature() that are valuable through a variety of machine learning methods; and 4) use the above to create a decision support tool that will be used in 3 clinical trial situations.  .

"Quantitative PET/CT Analysis to Improve Evaluation of Tumor Response DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose to develop and validate a quantitative Positron Emission Tomography / Computed Tomography (PET/CT) image analysis framework to improve the evaluation of esophageal tumor response to chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer. In Aim 1, we will extract comprehensive spatial and temporal features of a tumor from PET/CT images and evaluate their ability in predicting tumor response to CRT. These features will quantify the spatial characteristics of a tumor along with their changes due to CRT, adding a great amount of information to the current non-volumetric PET/CT response measures. Also, we will use image registration techniques to align pre-CRT images with post-CRT images, making it possible to quantify the spatial changes at the original tumor site. In Aim 2, we will construct and test reliable predictive models of tumo response to CRT using machine learning techniques with spatial- temporal PET/CT features, clinical parameters and demographics as input. The models will identify an optimal subset of predictive features and utilize PET and CT information in chorus. In Aim 3, we will develop a novel multi-modality adaptive region-growing algorithm for tumor delineation in PET/CT. We will compare the accuracy and precision of the resulting predictive models against those in which tumor is delineated using conventional methods (manual contouring or thresholding). This comparison will help us understand to what degree the prediction of tumor response depends on the tumor delineation methods. Finally, we will use pathologic response and survival as the end points and ground truth to cross-validate each predictive model. If all aims are achieved, the proposed PET/CT image analysis framework may provide a highly accurate diagnostic tool. This, will complement other diagnostic tests in assisting physicians in making a treatment decision to more appropriately select patients for surgery, thus avoiding the mortality and morbidity of surgery in responders for whom surgery can be safely deferred; while improving local control and survival in non- responders for whom surgery should be considered. Therefore, this work has the potential to improve outcomes by safely deferring surgery which will improve our locally advanced esophageal cancer patient's quality of life while simultaneously reducing costs.

"Topology of Cancer Evolution and Heterogeneity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In solid tumors, current limitations in our ability to identify the cell(s) of origin, track the dynamics of tumor subclonal architecture over space and time, and predict drug sensitivities in a mechanistic fashion pose significant challenges to our ability to develop effective treatments and undermine the utility of available therapies, particularly in tumors that become resistant. In this proposal, we argue that approaches based in mathematics and physics are well suited for addressing these critical problems. Historically, the physical sciences have been successful in solving fundamental scientific problems by producing reductionist models that enable the development of conceptual premises, technological breakthroughs that enable new kinds of measurements, and mathematical tools that can accurately represent and predict future activity. In this new Columbia University Physical Sciences-Oncology Center for Topology of Cancer Evolution and Heterogeneity (CUPS-OC), our goal is to develop, validate, and deliver a set of complementary mathematical, technological, and computational approaches that will provide the cancer research community with a framework for unraveling complexity in solid tumors, with the long-term aim of improving diagnosis and treatment. More specifically, the Center's primary research focus will be to study evolution and heterogeneity of solid tumors at the single cell level, by developing lineage tracing techniques in organoid and in vivo systems, single cell sequencing in primary tumors, and emerging genomics-based approaches for identifying targeted therapies. These experimental approaches will be supported by the development of novel, robust, and effective mathematical and computational approaches based in the field of topology, which offers unique and powerful methods for addressing the essential challenge of interpreting the high-dimensional data sets that state-of-the- art genomics technologies generate. In addition, we will promote the integration of physical science approaches into cancer research by both training new researchers and engaging established researchers working at the intersection of the physical sciences and cancer biology. Each of the projects and cores will address technical, mathematical, and biological challenges, contributing to the global enterprise of cancer research and to the development of a broader network of interdisciplinary researchers committed to advancing the field. If successful, we will be able to provide the scientific community with experimentally validated geometric and topological structures of causal inference of clonal evolution, single cell genomic protocols for fast and reliable uncovering of clonal heterogeneity, experimentally validated machine learning approaches for predicting drug sensitivities, and a strong multi-institutional, interdisciplinary program that creates bridges between researchers in pure mathematics, the technology sector, and cancer research.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cancer heterogeneity has been postulated as a major evolutionary force behind drug resistance.

"Systems Biology of Tumor Progression and Drug Resistance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The emergence of multidimensional datasets characterizing genetic, epigenetic, and functional properties of large normal and tumor-related samples is creating unique opportunities for the systems-level dissection of mechanisms associated with malignant phenotypes. Coupled with novel high-throughput technologies and computational methodologies for the dissection, interrogation, and perturbation of genome-wide regulatory pathways, this will lead to highly efficient approaches for the rapid identification and validation of therapeutic targets, their small molecule inhibitors, and associated biomarkers. Columbia University investigators have pioneered systems-biology-based approaches for the dissection of regulatory networks in human malignancies and for their interrogation, using computational, RNAi, and small-molecule approaches, to identify molecular targets for therapeutic intervention. The goal of this project is the use and build upon a successful pipeline between the investigators labs for the discovery and validation of master regulator modules that implement functional bottlenecks that integrate aberrant signals from multiple genetic and epigenetic alterations, and thus, constitute natural dependencies (i.e., Achille's heel) for the tumor subtype. These will be characterized in terms of their synergistic behavior, driver genetic alterations, and druggable modulators. This pipeline will allow processing of a novel tumor phenotype every 18 to 24 months, yielding validated individual and synergistic targets that constitute either oncogene or non-oncogene dependencies of the tumor or that increase sensitivity to existing FDA approved or late-stage development compounds. Relevance: The identification of targets that abrogate tumorigenesis in the patient, are extensively biochemically characterized, chemically tractable, and highly penetrant constitutes one of the greatest challenges of cancer research.

"Dynamic-CT-based biomarker for predicting clinical outcome in CRC DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States and is responsible for significant morbidity and mortality. A patient's five-year survival rate depend on the tumor stage at the time of diagnosis, and stage of the tumor plays a substantial role in decision-making regarding treatment. Thus, precise pre-treatment diagnostic evaluation and staging of colorectal cancer are important. In addition, angiogenesis plays an important role in the process of growth and metastasis in CRC and is reported as a useful prognostic marker, similar to many other carcinomas. Thus, in vivo quantification of the tumor angiogenesis rate holds promise in improving the management of CRC. Perfusion computed tomography (PCT) acquires high temporal resolution images, thus enabling evaluation of hemodynamic changes of tissue in vivo by modeling tracer kinetics. PCT has been reported to characterize tumor angiogenesis, and to be a more sensitive imaging biomarker for predicting of overall survival (OS) of CRC patients than conventional tumor staging. In clinical practice, however, the PCT protocol is a trade-off between high-temporal resolution and the total radiation dose required. Thus, the use of dynamic CT imaging derived from four temporal phases, which include pre-contrast, arterial, portal, and delayed phases, is highly desirable, because it is more readily available and yields substantially lower radiation exposure to the patients than that of PCT. However, low temporal resolution in four-phase dynamic CT presents several barriers in modeling tracer kinetics, primarily because of the lack of temporal enhancement information, which limits the ability to obtain reliable physiological information. We will thus develop a novel continuous-time modeling of tracer kinetics without any discretization of the enhancement curves. Such an approach will enable estimation of the time lag between onset time points of input and response enhancements as well as other kinetic parameters in four-phase dynamic CT. We hypothesize that the proposed tracer kinetic model can be an effective imaging biomarker for the risk stratification of recurrence of CRC and for prediction of OS. To explore these hypotheses, the specific aims of the proposed project are (1) Develop a novel single-input continuous-time tracer kinetic model without any discretization to fit temporal enhancement curves in four-phase dynamic CT of the colon, and (2) develop kinetic-model-based imaging biomarkers from four-phase dynamic CT and evaluate their performance in predicting clinical outcome in CRC patients. Successful development of a novel imaging biomarker based on four-phase dynamic CT holds high promise for the development of tailor-made optimal therapy without excessive radiation exposure to the patient. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful development of a novel imaging biomarker based on four-phase dynamic CT holds high promise for the development of tailor-made optimal therapy without excessive radiation exposure to the patient. Using such a biomarker to optimize therapy will provide patients with more effective treatment, thus reducing side effects associated with unnecessary therapeutic regimens.

While being free of the primary tumor after treatment is encouraging, it is emotionally devastating to step out of the clinic after a yearly checkup with a diagnosis of metastatic disease. Approximately 90% of cancer lethality is due to metastasis - the spreading of primary tumor cells to distant organs. Despite a dramatic increase in early screening methods and comprehensive treatment regimens for primary breast tumors, the overall mortality of patients who relapsed with metastatic cancer in the US has not changed in the past two decades. Clinical failure in treating metastatic tumors is largely due to the evolutionary nature of tumor metastasis. In order to survive and establish secondary tumors in a different tissue microenvironment at distant organs, disseminated tumor cells have to adapt (metastatic evolution) to the host environment. Clinically, metastatic tumors exhibit drastically different characteristics from their primary counterpart. Therefore, current cancer treatments, designed based on the features of primary tumors, are rarely effective.          Optimal design of breakthrough anti-metastasis therapies relies on our in-depth understanding of the common and functionally important traits during the early metastatic evolution. In this proposed study, we will use breast cancer brain metastasis as model system and take state-of-the-art approaches to trace and analyze a single cancer cell within its precise metastatic microenvironment from the initial moment of metastatic colonization. This collaborative effort from a multidisciplinary team, including a cancer biologist, a computational biologist, a mathematician and a bioinformatician will allow us to: 1) depict the dynamics of gene transcription during the different stages of brain metastasis at single cell level; 2) visualize th behavior of a single colonized metastatic tumor cell and its interaction with the microenvironment through real-time intravital imaging and deep tissue imaging; 3) mathematically integrate molecular (RNA-seq), behavioral (intravital) and structural (deep tissue imaging) information to identify the common and functionally important early metastatic evolutionary traits during the breast cancer brain metastasis in its native tissue context.          Shifting the current clinical treatment model relies on new in-depth mechanistic insight obtained through basic and pre-clinical innovative research. Utilizing cutting-edge sequencing and imaging modality in our proposed study, we will have the capacity to systematically dissect traits of early metastatic behavior and discover potential novel therapeutic targets for paradigm-shifting novel adjuvant therapy tailored to specific target metastatic evolution. The conceptual validation from our bold and pioneering attempt proposed in this study will serves as a blueprint for a new category of adjuvant therapies for effective anti-metastasis treatment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful anti-metastasis treatment is rooted deep in our mechanistic understanding of early metastatic evolution and our capability to stop metastatic progression before aggressive outgrowth occurs. Using single cell transcriptome sequencing and multiplexed single cell deep-tissue imaging, we aim to trace and analyze the lineage dynamics of a single cancer cell within its specific metastatic microenvironment from the initial moment of metastatic colonization. The conceptual advances validated from this study will serve as a blueprint for future adjuvant therapies targeting early metastatic evolution, providing more effective cancer treatments.",(PQD-3) Spatiotemporal Molecular Interrogation of Early Metastatic Evolution In Situ,8876876,R01CA194697,"['post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' Aftercare ', ' Algorithms ', ' Behavior ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cells ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' Evolution ', ' Exhibits ', ' Spillage ', ' Leakage ', ' Extravasation ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Methods ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Biological Models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' tumor cell metastasis ', ' cancer metastasis ', ' Tumor Cell Migration ', ' Secondary Tumor ', ' Secondary Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Tumor ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm ', ' Metastasize ', ' Metastasis ', ' Neoplasm Metastasis ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' pressure ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Secondary to ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Metastatic Tumor to the Brain ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm to the Brain ', ' Brain Metastasis ', ' Metastatic malignant neoplasm to brain ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' insight ', ' Disease Progression ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Cell Structure ', ' Cell Components ', ' Cellular Structures ', ' Oncologist ', ' Metabolism Studies ', ' Metabolic Studies ', ' Abnormal Assessment of Metabolism ', ' metabolic abnormality assessment ', ' Staging ', ' Malignant Cell ', ' cancer cell ', ' Metastatic Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Cancer ', ' Disseminated Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Nature ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' Distant ', ' In Situ ', ' Tumor Cell ', ' neoplastic cell ', ' success ', ' checkup ', ' Check-up ', ' checkup examination ', ' trait ', ' Adjuvant Therapy ', ' Primary Tumor ', ' Primary Neoplasm ', ' novel ', ' Categories ', ' Modeling ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer therapy ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Address ', ' mammary tumor ', ' Mammary Cancer ', ' Breast Tumors ', ' Breast Neoplasms ', ' Mammary Neoplasms ', ' Data ', ' in vivo ', ' Cancer Survivor ', ' trial treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' transcriptome ', ' gene expression signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' data integration ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' preclinical research ', ' pre-clinical research ', ' therapeutic target ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' tumor ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' clinical practice ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA-seq ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' screening ', ' intravital imaging ', ' four-dimensional imaging ', ' 4-D imaging ', ' 4D Imaging ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME,R01,2015,347700,IN-02,0.07027368504531031
"Integrative Cancer Genomics: Drivers, Pathways and Drugs DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The emergence of cancer genomics, combined with increased understanding of the molecular basis of oncogenesis, has stimulated hope that treatment will improve by becoming more targeted and individualized in nature. Cancer genomics studies established a number of critical cancer genes, leading to a number of successful targeted therapies (e.g. Gleevec, Herceptin and Plexxikon). Despite these successes, most cancers do not have a targeted therapy and when one exists, response is highly variable, even among patients that share the targeted mutation and tumor type. To move cancer into the era of personalized therapies, it becomes important to identify the alterations driving tumor progression in each tumor, determine the network that links these aberrations, and identify factors that predict sensitivity to targeted therapies. As projects such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) amass cancer cell genomes at a breathtaking pace, a staggering genetic complexity is revealed. To interpret cancer genomes, a key computational challenge is to separate the wheat from the chaff and define both what are the key alterations likely to be functionally driving cancer and then, after defining such genes, begin to identify mechanisms of action and therapeutic implications. Leveraging components from our published methods, CONEXIC (Akavia et.al Cell 2010) and LirNet (Lee et.al, PLOS Gen 2009), we will develop machine-learning algorithms that integrate cancer genomic data to do just that. We will apply the methods we develop to melanoma, glioblastoma, ovarian, breast and colon cancer and experimentally follow up on our computational findings, towards a better understanding of each of these deadly cancers. The approaches developed in this grant will accelerate discovery to rapidly extract the maximal value from modern genomic studies and help carry cancer genomics from the diagnostic to the therapeutic realm. This work aims to develop methods that help dissect the genetic complexity of individual cancers. For each tumor we aim to identify which mutations arm a cell with the abilities to abnormally grow or evade drug treatment, providing a foundation of tools towards personalized cancer treatment. We will apply these methods for discovery in some of the most aggressive cancers that currently lack good therapeutic solutions including glioblastoma, ovarian cancer and melanoma.","Integrative Cancer Genomics: Drivers, Pathways and Drugs",8913905,R01CA164729,"['Algorithms ', ' anticancer drug ', ' anticancer agent ', ' Tumor-Specific Treatment Agents ', ' Neoplastic Disease Chemotherapeutic Agents ', ' Cancer Drug ', ' Antineoplastics ', ' Antineoplastic Drugs ', ' Anti-Cancer Agents ', ' Antineoplastic Agents ', ' driving ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cells ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' resistant to Drug ', ' resistance to Drug ', ' drug resistant ', ' Drug resistance ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Feedback ', ' Foundations ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Glioblastoma ', ' spongioblastoma multiforme ', ' glioblastoma multiforme ', ' Grade IV Astrocytoma ', ' Grade IV Astrocytic Tumor ', ' Grade IV Astrocytic Neoplasm ', ' Grant ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Malignant Melanoma ', ' melanoma ', ' Methods ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' Transforming Genes ', ' Cancer-Promoting Gene ', ' Cancer Genes ', ' Oncogenes ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' gene product ', ' Proteins ', ' Publishing ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Solutions ', ' Time ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' related to A and C-protein ', ' rac protein kinase ', ' proto-oncogene protein akt ', ' proto-oncogene protein RAC ', ' protein-serine-threonine kinase (rac) ', ' c-akt protein ', ' RAC-PK protein ', ' Protein Kinase B ', ' Akt protein ', ' AKT ', ' Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt ', ' base ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' cancer progression ', ' tumor progression ', ' improved ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Collaborations ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Herceptin ', ' Roche brand of trastuzumab ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' success ', ' novel ', ' Colonic Carcinoma ', ' Colon Cancer ', ' Colon Carcinoma ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Genomics ', ' Glivec ', ' Gleevec ', ' genetic determinant ', ' Genetic Determinism ', ' miRNAs ', ' miRNA ', ' Micro RNA ', ' MicroRNAs ', ' Sequence-Specific Posttranscriptional Gene Silencing ', ' RNAi ', ' RNA Silencing ', ' Quelling ', ' Posttranscriptional Gene Silencing ', ' Post-Transcriptional Gene Silencing ', ' RNA Interference ', ' ovarian cancer ', ' Ovary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Ovary ', ' Malignant Ovarian Tumor ', ' Malignant Ovarian Neoplasm ', ' Malignant neoplasm of ovary ', ' rapamycin and FKBP12 target 1 protein, human ', ' mTOR ', ' human RAPT1 protein ', ' human RAFT1 protein ', ' human FKBP-rapamycin associated protein ', ' Rapamycin Target Protein ', ' FKBP12 Rapamycin Complex Associated Protein 1 ', ' FKBP-Rapamycin Associated Protein ', ' FK506 binding protein 12-rapamycin associated protein 1, human ', ' FK506 Binding Protein 12-Rapamycin Associated Protein 2 ', ' FK506 Binding Protein 12-Rapamycin Associated Protein 1 ', ' human FRAP1 protein ', ' Oncogenesis ', ' tumorigenesis ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' Data ', ' MSKCC ', ' Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center ', ' Validation ', ' Molecular ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' oncogenomics ', ' cancer genomics ', ' cancer genome ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' AKT inhibition ', ' tumorigenic ', ' DNA copy number ', ' resistant ', ' Resistance ', ' tumor ', ' arm ', ' TCGA ', ' The Cancer Genome Atlas ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized medicine ', ' ']",NCI,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R01,2015,554295,NY-13,0.0711103507837776
"Objective decision support environment for clinical trials DESCRIPTION:  Brain tumors are the second- and fifth-most common cause of cancer death in males and females under 40, respectively. The 5-year relative survival rate is only 33%, even after decades of research into new treatments. Imaging based on ""virtual biopsy"" can provide information about the entire lesion in a minimally or non-invasive way. Prior work by our group has demonstrated that image processing methods applied to serial examinations together (as opposed to applying them to individual examinations) can make subtle changes in brain tumors more apparent, allowing earlier detection of progression. We see the union of virtual biopsy methods and change detection methods as an innovative and powerful combination that our team is uniquely qualified to develop and evaluate. In this application, we will implement several feature selection (FS) methods in a tool that is ""image friendly"". This tool will help select informative features from images; apply a wide range of existing ML algorithms to determine which features are important predictors of therapy response, and to evaluate the impact of a decision support application using these features and ML in a clinical trial. The final stage of th proposal will test the decision support tools in 3 clinical scenarios to see if they are able to significantly improve the decision making of clinicians in a clinical trial.  The long-term goal of this proposal is to develop virtual biopsy technology that will enhance the clinical decision making process by providing tools for investigation of image-based therapy response assessment tools, that may also have some ability to predict outcome. We hope to apply the technology to other organ systems and other imaging technologies. We anticipate this project will impact clinical trials by enabling investigation of alternative outcome measures that are objectively assessed using algorithm evaluation methods. Such a toolset should be useful to the entire cancer imaging community to help evaluate features in old and new imaging technologies that correlate with patient survival. As such, this is ideal for helping the Quantitative Imaging Network (QIN) achieve its goals. The selection of features that reflect response to therapy has long been the domain of the clinical radiologist. When imaging was relatively straightforward (e.g. a chest X-ray of lung cancer), a measurement or a visual assessment was a reasonable metric. Today, advanced imaging devices produce large amounts of data that reflect a range of properties. In this work, we build on previous work developing computer techniques for identifying and characterizing changes in brain tumors, using MRI. In this proposal, we will focus on building 1) a high quality database of brain cancer imaging, clinical data, ""-omic"" data, outcomes data; 2) a library of easily accessed tools for computing features that might be important predictors of tumor response; 3) a tool that will help objectively establish the feature() that are valuable through a variety of machine learning methods; and 4) use the above to create a decision support tool that will be used in 3 clinical trial situations.",Objective decision support environment for clinical trials,8926887,U01CA160045,"['Algorithms ', ' Biopsy ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' tumors in the brain ', ' Brain Tumors ', ' Brain Neoplasia ', ' Brain Neoplasms ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Decision Making ', ' Environment ', ' Female ', ' Goals ', ' Libraries ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' male ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' thorax radiography ', ' thoracic radiogram ', ' radiographic lung image ', ' radiographic chest image ', ' lung radiography ', ' chest radiography ', ' chest Xray ', ' chest X ray ', ' CXR ', ' Thoracic Radiography ', ' Work ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Brain ', ' Brain Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of brain ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' improved ', ' brain visualization ', ' Brain imaging ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Lesion ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' Measurement ', ' RDST ', ' radiologist ', ' Differentiation Therapy ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Investigation ', ' Techniques ', ' Organ System ', ' body system ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Primary Brain Tumors ', ' Primary Brain Neoplasms ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Imaging Tool ', ' Imaging Device ', ' Qualifying ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Collection ', ' Pathologic ', ' Process ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Output ', ' virtual ', ' Outcome ', ' cancer imaging ', ' Imaging technology ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' tumor ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' ']",NCI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,U01,2015,522865,MN-01,0.07828513749825629
"Biomarkers for Staging and Treatment Response Monitoring of Bladder Cancer DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Bladder cancer is a common type of cancer that can cause substantial morbidity and mortality among both men and women. Bladder cancer causes over 15,210 deaths per year in the United States. It is estimated that 72,570 new bladder cancer cases will be diagnosed in 2013. Correct staging of the bladder cancer is crucial for the decision of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and minimizing the risk of under-treatment or over-treatment. A reliable assessment of the response to neoadjuvant therapy at an early stage is vital for identifying tumors that do not respond and allowing the patient a chance of alternative treatment. MRI and CT are important methods for pre-treatment staging or treatment response monitoring for a variety of bladder cancers. CT is an effective non-invasive modality for measuring primary site gross tumor volume (GTV) and the addition of MRI is on the rise. GTV has been used as a biomarker for predicting treatment outcome of bladder tumors. Other pathological information and diagnostic test (bimanual evaluation, cystoscopy) results and immunohistochemical biomarkers are also useful for staging and treatment response monitoring. The goal of this project is to develop effective decision support tools that merge image-based and non-image-based biomarkers to assist radiologists and oncologists in assessment of cancer stage and change as a result of treatment. We will (1) develop a quantitative image analysis tool (QIBC) for bladder GTV estimation on multi-modality (MM) images, (2) develop a computer decision support system (CDSS-S) to assist clinicians in cancer staging, (3) develop a computer decision support system (CDSS-T) to assist clinicians in evaluation of the change in the tumor characteristics as a result of neoadjuvant treatment, (4) evaluate the effects of QIBC and CDSS-T on inter-clinician variability and efficiency in estimation of GTV and treatment response, and (5) evaluate CDSS-S and CDSS-T as decision support tools in pilot clinical studies. We hypothesize that the use of QIBC, CDSS-S and CDSS-T can improve the clinicians' accuracy, consistency and efficiency in bladder GTV estimation on MM imaging exams, the assessment of bladder cancer stage and response to treatment. To test our hypothesis, we will perform the following specific tasks: (1) to collect a database of multi-modality MR, CT exams of bladder cancers for development, training and testing of the QIBC and CDSS algorithms; (2) to develop advanced computer vision techniques to quantitatively estimate bladder GTV and image characteristics; (3) to develop predictive models using machine learning techniques to combine MM image-based, pathological and immunohistochemical biomarkers for cancer staging and determination of non-responders; (4) to compare the inter-clinician variability and efficiency in clinicians' estimation of GTV and treatment response with and without the proposed QIBC and CDSS-T by observer studies; and (5) to evaluate the CDSS-S and CDSS-T as decision support tools in pilot clinical studies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: If successfully developed, the CDSS-S and CDSS-T can serve as non-invasive, objective, and reproducible clinical decision support systems for cancer staging and treatment response monitoring. Correct staging of the bladder cancer is crucial for the decision of chemotherapy treatment and minimizing the risk of under-treatment or over-treatment. If the response to chemotherapy can be estimated accurately it is possible to identify those patients that do not respond, stop the treatment early, and seek alternative treatment. In addition, although we will focus on the specific application to the bladder tumors in this proposed project, we will design the decision support tools in a modular, expandable, and re-trainable framework. The software package will be versatile and is adaptable to other tumor types or imaging modalities in the future by proper retraining with case samples of the tumor type of interest and expansion of the decision support tools as needed. Therefore, the development of the CDSS-S and CDSS-T will potentially benefit not only the bladder tumor patients but also patients with other tumor types that require staging and monitoring of treatment response.",Biomarkers for Staging and Treatment Response Monitoring of Bladder Cancer,8849399,U01CA179106,"['post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' Aftercare ', ' Algorithms ', ' urinary bladder ', ' Bladder Urinary System ', ' Bladder ', ' Urinary Bladder Malignant Tumor ', ' Urinary Bladder Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Bladder ', ' Malignant Bladder Neoplasm ', ' Bladder Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder ', ' Urinary Bladder Tumor ', ' Urinary Bladder Neoplasm ', ' Bladder Tumors ', ' Bladder Neoplasm ', ' Breast ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' in situ cancer ', ' Preinvasive Carcinoma ', ' Intraepithelial Carcinoma ', ' Carcinoma in Situ ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' computer vision ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' Computers ', ' Cystoscopy ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' indexing ', ' Interobserver Variations ', ' Inter-Observer Variation ', ' Inter-Observer Variability ', ' Interobserver Variability ', ' Libraries ', ' Nodular Lymphoma ', ' Giant Follicular Lymphoma ', "" Follicular Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma "", ' Follicle Center Lymphoma ', ' Brill-Symmers Disease ', ' Follicular Lymphoma ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Minor ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' muscular ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' Muscle ', ' Necrotic ', ' Necrosis ', ' Tumor Staging ', ' Neoplasm Staging ', ' Cancer Staging ', ' Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' urogenital system (urinary part) ', ' Urogenital System ', ' Urogenital ', ' Genitourinary ', ' Genitourinary system ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Biochemical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Oncologist ', ' RDST ', ' radiologist ', ' Descriptor ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Texture ', ' Techniques ', ' Test Result ', ' Head and Neck ', ' Head and neck structure ', ' Tumor Volume ', ' Tumor Tissue ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' palpable disease ', ' Palpable ', ' Clinical Decision Support Systems ', ' interest ', ' Neoadjuvant Treatment ', ' Neoadjuvant ', ' NEOADJ ', ' Induction Therapy ', ' Neoadjuvant Therapy ', ' novel ', ' Modality ', ' Sampling ', ' Decision Support Systems ', ' response ', ' cancer location ', ' cancer site ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer therapy ', ' Institution ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Lymphovascular ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' computerized ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' cancer type ', ' prospective ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' early therapy ', ' Early treatment ', ' caBIG ', ' cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid ', ' open source ', ' computer monitor ', ' chemotherapy ', ' tumor ', ' multimodality ', ' alternative treatment ', ' treatment response ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' oncology program ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2015,554150,MI-12,0.09527429587435889
"Quantitative Analysis of GBM Invasion Mechanisms with New Imaging Protocol DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glioblastoma (GBM, WHO grade IV) is the most common and highest-grade astrocytoma with uniformly dismal prognosis. In contrast to the lower grade gliomas (grades II and III), GBMs present radial growth rates almost 10 times as fast. Three pathophysiologic features, including necrosis, cellular pseudopalisades surrounding necrosis, and microvascular hyperplasia, are considered as hallmarks for GBM prognosis and are believed to be relevant to the drastically accelerated disease progression. Additionally, a population of Glioma Stem Cells (GCSs) has been found pertinent to the new neovascular formation, leading to GBM tumor outward growth. However, the definitive roles of these pathologic features and the associated signaling networks in GBM progression and their interactive mechanisms remain ill defined, because of limited capacity of biomarker observation and data analysis. The proposed project will create a new avenue for GBM research by leveraging computational power and machine intelligence for analyses of large-scale pathology images and spatially referenced, multiplexed biomarker data. A comprehensive system and analytical infrastructure will be developed to quantitatively investigate 1) spatial distributions f GBM invasion-related pathologic structures and GSCs, 2) functions of the in-situ signaling genes and regulatory networks responsible for GBM progression, and 3) the significance of morphologic, molecular, and signaling network variation across GBM microenvironments. A set of scalable image processing algorithms for analyses of spatial distributions and co-localizations of phenotypic features and biomarkers will be developed and applied to whole-slide pathology brightfield and quantum dot immunohistochemistry images of GBMs. Derived features and boundaries of phenotypic structures, and spatial distributions of biomarkers will be archived and integrated in a database for pathology and in-situ molecular imaging data where scientific queries can be invoked to support the analysis of GBM tumor progression mechanisms. In particular, multiplexed quantum dot immunohistochemistry (mQD-IHC), a new biomarker staining technique, will be leveraged to show the locations and expressions of multiple biomarkers of interest within the same tissue spatial reference. The combined expertise in large-scale pathology image process, high performance data computation, mQD-IHC staining technique for multiplexed biomarker investigation, and phenotype- genotype data integration supported by high-throughput data query power from customized database enables a unique research vehicle to investigate GBM tumor expansion mechanisms. Notably, the proposed research work can be generalized to catalyze other computational cancer research involving large-scale data and phenotype-genotype information integration.

"Targeting Tumors with NF1 Loss ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Genomic information can allow investigators to devise precision therapies that target molecular lesions specific to a patient's cancer. One of the molecular lesions present in many malignant tumors is loss of the NF1 tumor suppressor, which is a driver in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), one of the most frequently inherited genetic disorders. NF1 exhibits a broad clinical spectrum including benign nervous system tumors called neurofibromas, low-grade astrocytomas, pheochromocytoma, and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. Plexiform neurofibromas (PN) occur in deep nerves and can degenerate into malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), chemo- and radiation-resistant sarcomas with a dismal 20% five-year survival rate. In NF1 carriers, the lifetime risk is 30% for PN and 8-15% for MPNST. NF1 mutations are also found in sporadic tumors including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), melanoma, pheochromocytoma, ovarian, uterine, and lung cancers. Furthermore, in animal models and human tumor lines NF1 loss has been shown to drive GBM. A targeted molecular therapy designed to inhibit tumor-initiating and -promoting cells would substantially advance our ability to treat tumors that develop as a result of NF1 loss. Using complementary screening platforms, we identified small molecules that selectively killed or stopped the growth of cells carrying a mutation in NF1 as well as their molecular targets. In this application we focus on our top small molecule leads and the power of our model systems to test the hypothesis that aggressive neurological cancers that are known to be driven by NF1 loss and for which no cure exists, including PN, MPNST and GBM, will respond to molecules that we identified as synthetic lethal with NF1 loss. For this, we will determine pharmacokinetic properties of our top small molecule leads and, where needed, conduct structure-activity relationship studies to improve kinetics and/or reduce toxicity in order to test their efficacy in pre-clinical models of PN and GBM. We will leverage our model systems to define the mechanisms of action of our small molecule leads and add to our pipeline drugs in clinical trials that share the same targets. In addition to mutational inactivation, some GBM tumors exhibit down-regulation of the NF1 protein. Our lead compounds also stopped the growth of human GBM and neuroblastoma cells with low NF1 protein in vitro, supporting the broad application of the small molecule leads that we have identified. To capture tumors that have lost NF1 by any mechanism, we constructed an RNA-based classifier, which is capable of identifying downstream transcriptomic effects that indicate NF1 inactivation in GBM, using machine learning. We will apply the RNA-based classifier, along with targeted sequencing of NF1, to identify additional patient derived xenograft (PDX) GBM tumors that have an inactivating mutation of NF1 or molecular signatures of NF1 loss and test their response to our lead compounds in pre-clinical models. We expect that this work will provide new targets and therapeutic leads for aggressive neurological cancers driven by NF1 loss.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The work described in this proposal aims to find the Achilles heel of aggressive neurological cancers driven by NF1 loss for which no cure exists. These cancers include neurofibromas, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, glioblastoma (GBM), and neuroblastomas, all with dismal 5-year survival rates. Our multidisciplinary approach to develop an innovative conduit for identifying new targets with potential to cure such malignancies addresses an unmet clinical need.            ",Targeting Tumors

"Stimulated Raman imaging for label-free histology to guide brain tumor surgery ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of brain tumor surgery is to maximize removal of tumor without causing permanent neurologic deficits. Studies have shown that outcomes for patients depend strongly on these two variables. However, this is difficult because tumor tissue is often indistinguishable from healthy tissue in the operating room. Preoperative and intraoperative MRI through neuronavigation can be used to guide brain tumor surgery, but it is not able to accurately delineate the tumor margin due to the brain deformation and brain shift during surgery. H&E staining as the current gold standard is often performed intraoperatively for preliminary diagnosis, but it is not used to guide extent of resection routinely due to the limitations including tissue artifacts, labor-intensiveness, and time delay. Fluorescence guided surgery is beginning to be used to guided brain tumor surgery, but is generally not useful for low grade gliomas, the tumors which pose the greatest challenge and opportunity to extend survival and improve quality of life. Stimulated Raman imaging (SRI) has been used for rapid label-free biomolecular mapping in live tissue. Recently we have developed a novel approach with SRI to image nucleic acids, together with protein and lipids. Visualization of nucleic acids allows definition of nuclear morphology and chromatin structures, thereby enabling pathologic evaluation of clinically relevant cellular morphology, providing almost equivalent information to H&E staining. The goal of this translational research is to establish the methodology and practice for label-free histopathology with SRI for brain tumor diagnosis, and eventually develop it into a clinical device for ambient SR imaging of fresh tissue in the operating room in real time If the aims are achieved, this project will greatly improve the current clinical practice of brain tumor surgery by providing real time tissue diagnosis for more precise control of the extent of resection and preservation of neurologic function. Furthermore, this approach may be of value for all oncologic surgeries and other clinical pathology such as fine needle biopsies and bone marrow biopsy. The candidate for this award Dr. Fake Lu is a postdoctoral research fellow at Brigham and Women's Hospital. Dr. Lu has extensive experience and expertise in biophotonics and biomedical optics, specialized in system innovations of stimulated Raman microscopy and multiphoton microscopy for biomedical applications. BWH is an international leader in basic, clinical and translational research on human diseases, and has established multiple research programs to promote the work and professional career development of young investigators. BWH is also home to the National Center for Image Guided Therapy (P41) and the Advanced Multi-modality Image Guided operating suite (AMIGO) infrastructure which will greatly support to proposed research. Dr. Lu's long term research goal is to develop and apply advanced biophysical and optical technologies and devices to improve understanding, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases, such as cancers, for better health care. His long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator working at the frontier of translational research. The immediate objectives for the five-year award period is to 1) establish and evaluate label-free histopathology SRI for brain tumor diagnosis, 2) to demonstrate ambient imaging of surgically removed fresh tissue for diagnosis of brain tumors for real time guidance of neurosurgical resection, 3) to develop a novel stimulated Raman microscopy to collect full spectral data in parallel for label-free histopathology, as well as lipid biomarker screening, 4) t develop a computer algorithm for SR image analysis to realize automatic brain tumor diagnosis, and 5) finally by integrating the instrument and software to build and demonstrate a prototype of a clinical device for guiding neurosurgical resection of brain tumors. This device could also be used for other oncologic surgeries and will have great potential for commercialization. To conduct the proposed research, in addition to further develop his current strengths in biophotonics, stimulated Raman microscopy, and nonlinear optical microscopy, Dr. Lu plans to receive more education and training to enrich and expand his knowledge and expertise in the following four areas: 1) to receive critical training in conducting translational research, 2) to enrich his knowledge and deepen his understanding in brain tumor biology and medicine, 3) to learn skills in developing computer algorithms for SR image analysis, and 4) to prepare for writing grant applications and seeking funding independently. Dr. Lu will participate in 12 formal courses selected from those offered by Harvard Catalyst and Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. He will attend weekly seminars at BWH and Harvard University, seminar series on biomedical image analysis organized by MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. He will also attend one or two annual conferences per year to present his work for peer discussion. A strong mentoring team was organized to provide solid support to the proposed research and Dr. Lu's career development, including Dr. Alexandra Golby in neurosurgery at BWH, Prof. X. Sunney Xie in coherent Raman microscopy at Harvard, Prof. Nathalie Agar in molecular cancer diagnosis at BWH, Prof. Polina Golland in computer-based image analysis at MIT, and Dr. Sandro Santagata in neuropathology at BWH. This career development award will provide Dr. Lu with the training and skills needed to transition into an independent investigator in translational research.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Surgery is the standard treatment for brain tumors, and the goal of brain tumor surgery is to completely remove the tumor without causing neurologic deficits. However, it is often difficult to distinguish normal and cancerous tissue during surgery. This project aims to develop a novel tool based on stimulated Raman microscopy to image fresh brain tissue in a label-free manner, providing comparable histological information to conventional H&E staining, to guide brain tumor resection in real time in the operating room.                ",Stimulated

"Systems Microscopy Analysis of Tumor Cell Motility in Microenvironment Context DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Candidate: Majoring as analytical chemist during the time in Belgrade, Serbia, Dr. Gligorijevic has become an expert in optics and live cell microscopy over the course of her graduate training at Georgetown University and developed several novel microscopy-based technologies. During the postdoctoral period, Dr. Gligorijevic has focused on studying tumor cell intravasation in breast tumors, in living animals. To do so, she introduced several advancements into in vivo multiphoton microscopy. Dr. Gligorijevic is funded by DOD and Charles Revson Fellowship and has received several honors for her research. Her work to date resulted in one patent, ten peer-reviewed and ten other publications. Recent research has shown that different components of tumor microenvironment have an essential role in tumor progression. In order to decipher the network of interactions which shape the tumor environment and determine tumor cell behavior, it is ideal to apply systems biology approaches combined with in vivo microscopy, as cell cultures are limited in their complexity, mouse models are time-consuming and expensive and in silico models need optimization based on experiments. During the mentored phase of the Award, Dr. Gligorijevic will incorporate the relevant principles of advanced statistics and mathematical modeling of dynamical systems into her background of tumor biology and microscopy. She will take coursework offered at Einstein and meet regularly with her sponsor and co-sponsor. This training will make it possible to build a laboratory which investigates mechanisms of metastasis using the integrative, systems microscopy approach and utilizing information from molecular to population levels.  Environment: Sponsor of the PI, Dr. John Condeelis is a Co-Chair of Anatomy Department and Biophotonic Center at Einstein. His lab and the Center create a multidisciplinary environment focused on answering mechanisms of human diseases, such as cancer, through use of microscopy. The Center is well known for its shared imaging resources and Innovation Laboratory where new microscopy systems are custom-built to accommodate specific needs of different projects. Consulting member of Advisory Committee, Dr. Robert Singer, is an expert in combining experimental and theoretical biology and a renowned mentor. The co-sponsor, Dr. Aviv Bergman, is the Founding Chair of Systems Department at Einstein and teaches coursework which will be a part of the career development. Einstein is an institution which highly values collaboration and insists on career development of postdoctoral fellows, instructors and junior faculty.  Research: While most research of tumor microenvironments focuses on isolating and understanding single parameters, an integrative, systems-level network of interactions among relevant biological players is missing. In primary tumors, there are numerous biomechanical signals able to direct tumor cell movement towards and into the blood vessels. Growth factors, secreted by host macrophages, fibroblasts and endothelial cells in the tumor microenvironment are the main chemoattractants but recent studies show that the extracellular matrix also plays an important role. In loose extracellular matrix, tumor cells can migrate by reorganizing their cytoskeleton, generating a protrusive force. In regions with stiff extracellular matrix, simple locomotion is not possible. Here, tumor cells become invasive and degrade extracellular matrix, mainly by matrix metalloproteases (MMPs). Tumor cell migration was well characterized in vivo, but the mechanism of the switch from locomotory to invasive state and assembly of invasive protrusions in vivo are unknown. To address the link between integrated microenvironment signaling and the tumor cell behavior, it is necessary to combine cell biology, advanced microscopy and systems biology. In preliminary experiments, tumor cells were recorded using time-resolved 3D multiphoton imaging in living mice and two different protrusion types were observed: a) locomotory protrusions which quickly lead to migration of the tumor cell and b) invasive protrusions, which are persistent and MMP-dependent. The goal of Aim 1 is to investigate the role of invasive protrusions in the tumor cell intravasation and metastasis. A combination of fluorescent reporters will be used for imaging of invasive protrusion assembly and investigation of consequent tumor cell fate. Aim 2 explores signals which drive tumor cells to form either locomotory or invasive protrusions or to switch between behaviors. In areas which contain either locomotory or invasive protrusions, tumor microenvironment parameters are recorded simultaneously (number of macrophages, collagen stiffness, blood vessel size etc.). Imaging analysis results in a data matrix, which is analyzed by a Support Vector Machine classification. Classification shows that tumor cells switch from locomotory to invasive states under very specific conditions. Proposed experiments test the hypothesis that tumor cell behavior can be changed by slightly modifying microenvironment parameters. Relevant microenvironment parameters are incorporated into an integrative mathematical model of the tumor cell switch from locomotory to invasive state, in Aim 3. Using the predictive power of the model, experiments were designed to inhibit the invasive state and subsequent metastasis. Experimental outcomes will be used to optimize and complexify the model. Results of this study will lead to better understanding of the interplay among microenvironment components during tumor progression and the results will be used to improve diagnosis and treatment of early metastasis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project investigates the underlying mechanisms of tumor cell motility in the context of primary tumor microenvironment. Outcomes will reveal how host environment influences tumor cell entry into the blood vessels (intravasation). Findings will be applied towards new diagnostic and therapeutic markers for early metastasis in breast cancer.",Systems Microscopy Analysis of Tumor Cell Motility in Microenvironment

"Predicting brain tumor progression via multiparametric image analysis and modelin DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High-grade brain gliomas, the most common of which is glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), have terrible prognosis and a median patient survival of about 12 months. Although combinations of surgical removal, radiotherapy and chemotherapy are used in the clinical practice, a  fundamental and persistent limitation in treating these aggressive tumors is that they tend to  infiltrate into normal tissue well beyond margins visible via imaging. Since assessing the spatial  extent of tumor infiltration is nearly impossible using current radiologic reading practices, clinical  treatment tends to be restricted to parts that are deemed to be clearly malignant, frequently only  the enhancing tumor. This failure to aggressively treat the infiltrating tumor accelerates tumor  recurrence, and eventually patient death. This proposal aims to develop computational modeling  and image analysis methods that will improve our ability to estimate GBM infiltration, as well as  to predict tissue that is likelyto present fastest tumor recurrence, thereby eventually opening the  way for more aggressive, yet targeted, treatment, such as targeted aggressive surgical removal  and/or radiosurgery. To achieve our goal, we will integrate information from several sources:  1)  advanced multi-parametric imaging, which captures many aspects of tumor anatomy and  physiology~ 2) computational modeling of tumor growth and infiltration~ 3) machine learning  methods which, after appropriate training, can learn subtle and potentially complex imaging  phenotypes of infiltrating tumors~ 4) statistical atlases, which capture population-based trends  that can offer additional insights into tumor growth, such as relationship of infiltration to  vasculature and to white matter fiber pathways~ 5) data from one of the largest patient  populations having advanced imaging, genotyping, follow-up till tumor recurrence, and  histological analysis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop advance computational imaging and informatics methods for analysis  of high-grade gliomas (brain tumors). It will compile a unique database of data from several  hundred patients and will construct predictive models of infiltrating malignant tumor and of later  recurrence. Therefore, it will pave the way for more refined and targeted treatments of peritumoral brain tissue, which is where most tumor recurrence occurs.",Predicting brain tumor progression via multiparametric image analysis and modelin,8915752,R01NS042645,"['Accounting ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomy ', ' Atlases ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' Biophysics ', ' Biopsy ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' tumors in the brain ', ' Brain Tumors ', ' Brain Neoplasia ', ' Brain Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cells ', ' Communities ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Hydrops ', ' Dropsy ', ' Edema ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Future ', ' Genotype ', ' Glioblastoma ', ' spongioblastoma multiforme ', ' glioblastoma multiforme ', ' Grade IV Astrocytoma ', ' Grade IV Astrocytic Tumor ', ' Grade IV Astrocytic Neoplasm ', ' Glioma ', ' neuroglia tumor ', ' neuroglia neoplasm ', ' glial-derived tumor ', ' Neuroglial Tumor ', ' Neuroglial Neoplasm ', ' Glial Tumor ', ' Glial Neoplasm ', ' Glial Cell Tumors ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolism ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physiology ', ' preservation ', ' Biologic Preservation ', ' Biological Preservation ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Radiotherapy ', ' Radiotherapeutics ', ' Radiation therapy ', ' Reading ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Solutions ', ' statistics ', ' Technology ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Vascularization ', ' Work ', ' Radiosurgery ', ' Stereotaxic Radiosurgery ', ' Stereotactic Radiosurgery ', ' Stereotactic External Beam Irradiation ', ' Radiation Surgery ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Cell Density ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' cancer progression ', ' tumor progression ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Clinical ', ' Malignant ', ' Malignant - descriptor ', ' Training ', ' Fiber ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' insight ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Genetic ', ' Normal Tissue ', ' Normal tissue morphology ', ' Infiltration ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Scanning ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' brain tissue ', ' Tumor Cell ', ' neoplastic cell ', ' tumor growth ', ' cohort ', ' neuroimaging ', ' substantia alba ', ' white matter ', ' social ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' Excision ', ' Modeling ', ' neuropsychiatric ', ' neuropsychiatry ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Property ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematic model ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematical model ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Analysis ', ' molecular signature ', ' molecular profile ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' Expression Signature ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' trial treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' computational analysis ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' Pattern Recognition ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' image registration ', ' imaging informatics ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' cancer imaging ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' chemotherapy ', ' tumor ', ' patient population ', ' population based ', ' clinical practice ', ' biophysical modeling ', ' biophysical model ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2015,541169,PA-03,0.2443236523049038
"Characterization of the functions of one-carbon metabolism across human cancers Project Summary/Abstract Cancerous cells reprogram their metabolism to accommodate their needs. A deep understanding of this metabolic reprograming can lead to novel and promising routes toward cancer treatment. Different human cancers differ with respect to aspects of their metabolic rewiring, however a profound knowledge in this field is lacking. The main goal of my thesis project is to characterize the ways in which one-carbon metabolism — a metabolic pathway highly altered in cancer— is utilized by different human cancers and elucidate its consequences on downstream processes such as epigenetics and biosynthesis. Using information in genomic profiles of individual tumors, I build computational models to infer metabolic landscapes, assess their implications in patient survival, and predict response to chemotherapy. By studying one-carbon metabolites in the human serum, I confirm the relevance of theses findings in human contexts and suggest potentials for dietary intervention approaches. In aim 1, I characterize the usage of serine through one-carbon metabolism across human cancers. I performed flux analysis using gene expression profiles of hundreds of human tumors, followed by experimental validation using metabolomics approaches. In aim 2, I identify the determinants of human serum methionine. Diet records, serum metabolomics, and clinical data from a cohort of human subjects were incorporated into computational models. The determinants of variability in serum methionine were then quantified, suggesting a mechanism for regulation of cellular epigenetics by the diet. In aim 3, I determine the sources of variation in DNA methylation across human cancers and the contribution of metabolism. I integrated molecular and clinical profiles of thousands of human tumors from the TCGA into machine-learning algorithms to identify their association with DNA methylation. A major contribution from one-carbon metabolism in regulating DNA methylation status in tumors was found. In aim 4, I predict response to anti-metabolic chemotherapies based on tumor genomics. I plan to translate my previous findings into clinical discoveries. To this end, I will demonstrate how tumor profiles can be used to model patient survival, predict response to chemotherapy, and move toward precision medicine. Narrative Alteration in cellular metabolism is one the hallmarks of cancer. This project aims to elucidate the consequences of these alterations in cancer and reveal how different human cancers differ with respect to their metabolism.

"UCSC-Buck Specialized Genomic Data Analysis Center for the Genomic Data Analysis Network The “UCSC-Buck Genome Data Analysis Center for the Genomic Data Analysis Network” will develop state-of-the-art methods for integrating various types of data to discover the genetic pathways, the microenvironment, the originating cells, and the oncogenic processes driving the initiation and progression of tumors. The long term goals of the project are to identify highly accurate models detailing the faulty genetic circuitry at work in each subclone of a patient’s tumor, as well as any “normal” cells acting as accomplices by supporting the cancer microenvironment. The ultimate objective is to encode computer algorithms that can search a patient’s individual pathway diagram for the best combination of interventions to eliminate every tumor cell, while preserving the health of every normal cell, in their body. Integrative pathway analysis methods will be developed to reveal signatures of tumor subtypes from Pan-Cancer and external datasets. New technologies will be established for uncovering network models tailored to individual patients. The tools will be deployed as part of an active collaboration to support the specific projects of the Genome Data Analysis Network. Novel probabilistic graphical models will be used to infer disrupted signaling. Cellular signatures will be collected from the analysis of normal cells, cancer cell line models, and Pan-Cancer investigations. Novel machine-learning methods, guided by pathway mechanisms, will be established to identify cell state signatures in heterogeneous patient samples. This work will reveal rare mutations driving metastatic transformation that are currently of unknown significance. New clues about the genetic circuitry promoting response and resistance to treatment will be established. Finally, cross-tumor connections that relate tumors of one type to a different type will suggest new avenues for treatment. Computational strategies for interpreting the results of cancer genome sequencing projects are in  desperate need. To select appropriate treatment strategies for a patient, an accurate model of the  altered genetic wiring in the tumor is needed as well as how that wiring relates to other tumors  and to other normal cells at various stages of differentiation.

"Interpreting limits to nanoparticle delivery in high-stroma low-perfusion tumors 4.4.7 Project Summary/Abstract  The central theme in this work is that critical spatial patterns exist in highly resistant cancer stroma and vascular density that inherently inhibit larger nanoparticle penetration into cancer, and that these phenotypes can be imaged in vivo. We will use in vivo diagnostic imaging, combined with ex vivo analysis to test this in pancreatic cancer, which has as well known drug penetration limitation. Specifically, we will quantify nanoparticle penetration in pancreas cancer, which has high stroma content and low vascular density. The analysis and prediction of efficacy will be quantitatively developed by methodological correlation of in-vivo and ex vivo images using Fourier spatial frequency analysis.  We will determine the characteristic spatial patterns of these tumor microstructures that present as barriers to nanoparticle transport, as assayed through in vivo/ex vivo studies. We have seen that these characteristic spectral features appear in high-field magnetic resonance imaging (HF-MRI) scans and micro-Computed Tomography (uCT) scans of tumors imaged within the ongoing nanoparticle project at DHMC. The scope of this project is to conduct a secondary analysis on the images that are being produced within these projects, with two specific aims. 1) We will directly correlate nanoparticle penetration and distribution to the Fourier spatial frequencies found in in vivo images by Fourier spatial frequency analysis in which we have demonstrated expertise. The in vivo images will be analyzed by correlating them with histological sections of nanoparticle distribution post-treatment. Tumors will be classified on two levels as either a high or low permeability to a specific nanoparticle formulation (to quantify the amount of agent delivered), and as having high or low isotropy (to quantify the dispersion of the agent). 2) We will then apply this characteristic morphology analysis to pre-treatment, pre-operative HF-MRI, uCT images, and analyze their value as a potential diagnostic classifier. We will use a Support Vector Machine Analysis to predict the permeability and isotropy of unknown tumors, and validate our results against experimental outcomes. An iterative strategy will optimize the predictive power of the method, and be used to distinguish between characteristic spectra that are good and bad classifiers.  The research will be produced using the unique software systems that we have designed during preliminary studies, and will be deployed on an analysis platform that can be integrated with the hospital- based DICOM and virtual pathology environment to allow clinical investigators to plan adjuvant therapies to promote nanoparticle efficacy. Several hundred high-quality scans are now available for analysis, which will be processed and reported on within the first year of funding. By year two, the established system is projected to be able to analyze images within a few minutes post-scan. These analysis methods will give us the key background needed to advance our fundamental understanding of nanoparticle in-vivo delivery, and test ways to interrupt transport barriers in interventional future work. 4.4.8 Project Narrative The PI will apply a novel image analysis method to identify spatial patterns in images taken from in vivo experiments that indicate the presence of physical barriers to nanoparticle and liposomal transport in solid cancer tumor.

"Integrated Discovery Pipeline for Tumor Neoantigens Project Summary Cancer immunotherapy is now established as a major therapeutic modality. Significant progress with checkpoint inhibitor monoclonal antibodies demonstrates durable tumor regression in metastatic melanoma, lung cancer and other malignancies. One conspicuous limitation is the paucity of validated tumor antigens, which impedes clinical investigators in their pursuit of developing new cancer immunotherapies. Tumor encoded non-synonymous mutations may provide a new source of potential target antigens. T cells recognize tumor missense mutations as amino acid substituted peptides presented in the context of major histocompatibility molecules on the cancer cell surface, thus implicating missense mutations as a source of patient-specific neoantigens. We recently described the first-in-human study to use next generation sequencing technologies to identify and validate tumor missense mutations as neoantigens. Our study demonstrates that vaccination increases the breadth and diversity of neoantigen-specific T cells resulting in a broad repertoire of effector CD8+ T cells that uniquely discriminates mutated antigens from wild type peptides ensuring tumor specificity. This proposal aims to find a unique solution to the scarcity of tumor antigens by developing a neoantigen discovery pipeline that integrates genomic and proteomic technologies. In this proposal, a unique academic-industry partnership comprised of an established team of experts, in cancer genomics, cancer proteomics, human immunology, and clinical oncology, aim to solve the challenging problem of tumor neoantigen discovery. The long-term goal is to develop a robust pipeline using cutting-edge technologies merged with machine learning algorithms to supply tumor neoantigens for clinical investigation. The goal of this proposal will be addressed in the experiments of the following specific aims: 1) to identify the repertoire of melanoma expressed somatic mutations by next generation sequencing technologies; 2) to develop a novel proteomics platform to identify melanoma neoantigens presented by HLA class I molecules; 3) to validate neoantigen identification in a vaccination protocol. The proposed pipeline will deliver a transformative solution for tumor antigen identification, should be translatable to other “immune responsive“ malignancies and enable the nascent discipline of precision medicine to provide effective and safe immunotherapies for cancer patients. Project Narrative This project is relevant to public health as it aims to develop a neoantigen discovery pipeline to address the paucity of validated cancer antigens available for immunotherapy. The pipeline integrates two powerful and well-established technologies, genomics and proteomics.

"Systems Microscopy Analysis of Tumor Cell Motility in Microenvironment Context DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Candidate: Majoring as analytical chemist during the time in Belgrade, Serbia, Dr. Gligorijevic has become an expert in optics and live cell microscopy over the course of her graduate training at Georgetown University and developed several novel microscopy-based technologies. During the postdoctoral period, Dr. Gligorijevic has focused on studying tumor cell intravasation in breast tumors, in living animals. To do so, she introduced several advancements into in vivo multiphoton microscopy. Dr. Gligorijevic is funded by DOD and Charles Revson Fellowship and has received several honors for her research. Her work to date resulted in one patent, ten peer-reviewed and ten other publications. Recent research has shown that different components of tumor microenvironment have an essential role in tumor progression. In order to decipher the network of interactions which shape the tumor environment and determine tumor cell behavior, it is ideal to apply systems biology approaches combined with in vivo microscopy, as cell cultures are limited in their complexity, mouse models are time-consuming and expensive and in silico models need optimization based on experiments. During the mentored phase of the Award, Dr. Gligorijevic will incorporate the relevant principles of advanced statistics and mathematical modeling of dynamical systems into her background of tumor biology and microscopy. She will take coursework offered at Einstein and meet regularly with her sponsor and co-sponsor. This training will make it possible to build a laboratory which investigates mechanisms of metastasis using the integrative, systems microscopy approach and utilizing information from molecular to population levels.  Environment: Sponsor of the PI, Dr. John Condeelis is a Co-Chair of Anatomy Department and Biophotonic Center at Einstein. His lab and the Center create a multidisciplinary environment focused on answering mechanisms of human diseases, such as cancer, through use of microscopy. The Center is well known for its shared imaging resources and Innovation Laboratory where new microscopy systems are custom-built to accommodate specific needs of different projects. Consulting member of Advisory Committee, Dr. Robert Singer, is an expert in combining experimental and theoretical biology and a renowned mentor. The co-sponsor, Dr. Aviv Bergman, is the Founding Chair of Systems Department at Einstein and teaches coursework which will be a part of the career development. Einstein is an institution which highly values collaboration and insists on career development of postdoctoral fellows, instructors and junior faculty.  Research: While most research of tumor microenvironments focuses on isolating and understanding single parameters, an integrative, systems-level network of interactions among relevant biological players is missing. In primary tumors, there are numerous biomechanical signals able to direct tumor cell movement towards and into the blood vessels. Growth factors, secreted by host macrophages, fibroblasts and endothelial cells in the tumor microenvironment are the main chemoattractants but recent studies show that the extracellular matrix also plays an important role. In loose extracellular matrix, tumor cells can migrate by reorganizing their cytoskeleton, generating a protrusive force. In regions with stiff extracellular matrix, simple locomotion is not possible. Here, tumor cells become invasive and degrade extracellular matrix, mainly by matrix metalloproteases (MMPs). Tumor cell migration was well characterized in vivo, but the mechanism of the switch from locomotory to invasive state and assembly of invasive protrusions in vivo are unknown. To address the link between integrated microenvironment signaling and the tumor cell behavior, it is necessary to combine cell biology, advanced microscopy and systems biology. In preliminary experiments, tumor cells were recorded using time-resolved 3D multiphoton imaging in living mice and two different protrusion types were observed: a) locomotory protrusions which quickly lead to migration of the tumor cell and b) invasive protrusions, which are persistent and MMP-dependent. The goal of Aim 1 is to investigate the role of invasive protrusions in the tumor cell intravasation and metastasis. A combination of fluorescent reporters will be used for imaging of invasive protrusion assembly and investigation of consequent tumor cell fate. Aim 2 explores signals which drive tumor cells to form either locomotory or invasive protrusions or to switch between behaviors. In areas which contain either locomotory or invasive protrusions, tumor microenvironment parameters are recorded simultaneously (number of macrophages, collagen stiffness, blood vessel size etc.). Imaging analysis results in a data matrix, which is analyzed by a Support Vector Machine classification. Classification shows that tumor cells switch from locomotory to invasive states under very specific conditions. Proposed experiments test the hypothesis that tumor cell behavior can be changed by slightly modifying microenvironment parameters. Relevant microenvironment parameters are incorporated into an integrative mathematical model of the tumor cell switch from locomotory to invasive state, in Aim 3. Using the predictive power of the model, experiments were designed to inhibit the invasive state and subsequent metastasis. Experimental outcomes will be used to optimize and complexify the model. Results of this study will lead to better understanding of the interplay among microenvironment components during tumor progression and the results will be used to improve diagnosis and treatment of early metastasis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project investigates the underlying mechanisms of tumor cell motility in the context of primary tumor microenvironment. Outcomes will reveal how host environment influences tumor cell entry into the blood vessels (intravasation). Findings will be applied towards new diagnostic and therapeutic markers for early metastasis in breast cancer.",Systems Microscopy Analysis of Tumor Cell Motility in Microenvironment

"Stimulated Raman imaging for label-free histology to guide brain tumor surgery ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of brain tumor surgery is to maximize removal of tumor without causing permanent neurologic deficits. Studies have shown that outcomes for patients depend strongly on these two variables. However, this is difficult because tumor tissue is often indistinguishable from healthy tissue in the operating room. Preoperative and intraoperative MRI through neuronavigation can be used to guide brain tumor surgery, but it is not able to accurately delineate the tumor margin due to the brain deformation and brain shift during surgery. H&E staining as the current gold standard is often performed intraoperatively for preliminary diagnosis, but it is not used to guide extent of resection routinely due to the limitations including tissue artifacts, labor-intensiveness, and time delay. Fluorescence guided surgery is beginning to be used to guided brain tumor surgery, but is generally not useful for low grade gliomas, the tumors which pose the greatest challenge and opportunity to extend survival and improve quality of life. Stimulated Raman imaging (SRI) has been used for rapid label-free biomolecular mapping in live tissue. Recently we have developed a novel approach with SRI to image nucleic acids, together with protein and lipids. Visualization of nucleic acids allows definition of nuclear morphology and chromatin structures, thereby enabling pathologic evaluation of clinically relevant cellular morphology, providing almost equivalent information to H&E staining. The goal of this translational research is to establish the methodology and practice for label-free histopathology with SRI for brain tumor diagnosis, and eventually develop it into a clinical device for ambient SR imaging of fresh tissue in the operating room in real time If the aims are achieved, this project will greatly improve the current clinical practice of brain tumor surgery by providing real time tissue diagnosis for more precise control of the extent of resection and preservation of neurologic function. Furthermore, this approach may be of value for all oncologic surgeries and other clinical pathology such as fine needle biopsies and bone marrow biopsy. The candidate for this award Dr. Fake Lu is a postdoctoral research fellow at Brigham and Women's Hospital. Dr. Lu has extensive experience and expertise in biophotonics and biomedical optics, specialized in system innovations of stimulated Raman microscopy and multiphoton microscopy for biomedical applications. BWH is an international leader in basic, clinical and translational research on human diseases, and has established multiple research programs to promote the work and professional career development of young investigators. BWH is also home to the National Center for Image Guided Therapy (P41) and the Advanced Multi-modality Image Guided operating suite (AMIGO) infrastructure which will greatly support to proposed research. Dr. Lu's long term research goal is to develop and apply advanced biophysical and optical technologies and devices to improve understanding, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases, such as cancers, for better health care. His long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator working at the frontier of translational research. The immediate objectives for the five-year award period is to 1) establish and evaluate label-free histopathology SRI for brain tumor diagnosis, 2) to demonstrate ambient imaging of surgically removed fresh tissue for diagnosis of brain tumors for real time guidance of neurosurgical resection, 3) to develop a novel stimulated Raman microscopy to collect full spectral data in parallel for label-free histopathology, as well as lipid biomarker screening, 4) t develop a computer algorithm for SR image analysis to realize automatic brain tumor diagnosis, and 5) finally by integrating the instrument and software to build and demonstrate a prototype of a clinical device for guiding neurosurgical resection of brain tumors. This device could also be used for other oncologic surgeries and will have great potential for commercialization. To conduct the proposed research, in addition to further develop his current strengths in biophotonics, stimulated Raman microscopy, and nonlinear optical microscopy, Dr. Lu plans to receive more education and training to enrich and expand his knowledge and expertise in the following four areas: 1) to receive critical training in conducting translational research, 2) to enrich his knowledge and deepen his understanding in brain tumor biology and medicine, 3) to learn skills in developing computer algorithms for SR image analysis, and 4) to prepare for writing grant applications and seeking funding independently. Dr. Lu will participate in 12 formal courses selected from those offered by Harvard Catalyst and Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. He will attend weekly seminars at BWH and Harvard University, seminar series on biomedical image analysis organized by MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. He will also attend one or two annual conferences per year to present his work for peer discussion. A strong mentoring team was organized to provide solid support to the proposed research and Dr. Lu's career development, including Dr. Alexandra Golby in neurosurgery at BWH, Prof. X. Sunney Xie in coherent Raman microscopy at Harvard, Prof. Nathalie Agar in molecular cancer diagnosis at BWH, Prof. Polina Golland in computer-based image analysis at MIT, and Dr. Sandro Santagata in neuropathology at BWH. This career development award will provide Dr. Lu with the training and skills needed to transition into an independent investigator in translational research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Surgery is the standard treatment for brain tumors, and the goal of brain tumor surgery is to completely remove the tumor without causing neurologic deficits. However, it is often difficult to distinguish normal and cancerous tissue during surgery. This project aims to develop a novel tool based on stimulated Raman microscopy to image fresh brain tissue in a label-free manner, providing comparable histological information to conventional H&E staining, to guide brain tumor resection in real time in the operating room.",Stimulated Raman imaging for label-free histology to guide brain tumor surgery,9140064,K99EB020749,"['Agar ', ' Algorithms

"Quantitative Multimodal Image Guidance for Improved Liver Cancer Treatment Project Summary/Abstract  Liver cancer is the second most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide and is likely to grow even more in the next decade given the epidemic levels of hepatitis B and C and the emergence of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) due to obesity in the US. Most liver cancer patients present with disease that cannot be treated surgically. Minimally invasive, catheter-based, intra-arterial therapies such as TACE (transarterial chemoembolization) have become the mainstay therapy and are included in all treatment guidelines because of their ability to achieve local tumor control and extend survival. TACE overcomes the problem of chemoresistance in cancer cells by delivering high dose chemotherapy through image guidance and embolization of the tumor feeding blood vessel. TACE most commonly uses an oily medium (Lipiodol) as a radiopaque drug delivery mate- rial by creating an emulsion between drugs and oil. The recent introduction of drug-eluting bead (DEB) technol- ogy provides an opportunity to achieve the goal of controlled and sustainable drug release to tumors, which was not possible with oily TACE. Although TACE clearly improves patient survival, limitations still exist – speciﬁcally, incomplete treatment and tumor recurrence – attributed to the stimulation of angiogenesis. Most of these issues can be addressed with a greater understanding of the tumor microenvironment, in particular the relationship that exists between hypoxia, acidosis and angiogenesis. In fact, the development of imaging biomarkers reﬂecting changes within the tumor microenvironment is increasingly being pursued to individualize cancer therapies and increase their potency. Yet, our ability to characterize the tumor microenvironment using current imaging tech- nology is extremely limited. TACE has had to rely on 2D X-ray angiography until recently when the emergence of intra-procedural dual phase cone beam CT (DP-CBCT) contributed signiﬁcantly to improving tumor visualization, microcatheter guidance, and treatment endpoint. It is precisely through the longstanding close partnership be- tween Philips, Johns Hopkins and now Yale that this technology was optimized and became broadly accepted as the new standard of practice for TACE, demonstrating the prompt successful translation of research ﬁndings to clinical practice. However, the targeting of tumors and assessment of outcomes continues to be limited, relying on qualitative/semi-quantitative enhancement patterns from DP-CBCT and single parameter MR images. The unique partnership between Yale & Philips provides innovative technology that will directly enhance the role of image-guided intervention and address this unmet need by quantitatively characterizing the tumor microenvi- ronment and tumor tissue composition in order to maximize treatment potency and improve outcomes. We will integrate advanced, multiparameter MR with active CBCT imaging and create valuable biomarkers derived from novel machine learning methods for image and data analysis. By providing essential, quantitative information, drug delivery to tumors can be maximized because it will be based on inherent tumor properties. In the same way, the assessment of therapy will be much more precise and therefore useful to identify responders. Project Narrative This grant is aimed at enhancing our ability to deliver minimally invasive catheter-based treatments for liver cancer using drug delivery platforms which simultaneously embolize the tumor vasculature and locally deliver chemotherapy agents, and assess their efﬁcacy. At the core of the effort is the development, evaluation and translation to clinical practice of advanced imaging and analysis methods to characterize the tumor microen- vironment and derive feature information from novel multiparameter, multimodal images to classify tissue and quantify the response to therapy. The resulting methodology will lead to improved patient care through more precise delivery and more accurate response assessment.",Quantitative Multimodal Image Guidance for Improved Liver Cancer

"Online Raman Diagnostics of Oncometabolites Project Abstract  Cancer cells utilize normal metabolic processes out of context to promote tumor survival. For example, Otto Warburg and others discovered that tumors have increased glucose uptake, glycolysis, and lactate production, often with a reduction in citric acid cycle. While “aerobic glycolysis” at first glance is energetically expensive for tumor cells because it circumvents high ATP production from the citric acid cycle, it allows cancer cells to survive under low nutrient or low oxygen conditions and to instead use glycolytic intermediates for the synthesis of essential cellular building blocks without further energy investment. This change in metabolite regulation suggests a powerful method for monitoring and diagnosing cancer.  This project seeks to develop surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) as online detection method for the characterization of metabolites from breast cancer tumor models. Using the SERS results from tumor lysates, diagnostic algorithms will be constructed to improve treatment for cancer. Results show that fluid dynamics can be used to increase the reproducibility and sensitivity of SERS detection in flowing liquids. We propose to develop methodology to enable the use this innovation to investigate metabolites in cancer cell lysates using capillary electrophoresis coupled to a SERS flow detector. We will investigate known metabolites that have been linked to cancer, as well as examine key metabolites associated with oncogenes. The SERS data collected will be used to formulate diagnostic algorithms that can provide a yes/no indicator of cancer.  The specific aims of this project are as follows:  · AIM 1. Demonstrate the utility of the novel flow detector to assess changes in key metabolites from  tumor cell lysates. The tumor cell lysates will be compared with non-cancerous cell lysates to  identify trends in these metabolites relevant to breast cancer.  · AIM 2. Compare the identification and quantification capabilities with the current gold standard, LC-  MS. This aim will assess how SERS characterization both compares with existing technology but  also increases coverage of the metabolome.  · AIM 3. We will use the metabolites to develop statistical machine learning algorithms to predict the  sample label (cancer or not). The predictor obtained will be used as a diagnostic tool of cancer.

"Quantitative Analysis of GBM Invasion Mechanisms with New Imaging Protocol DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glioblastoma (GBM, WHO grade IV) is the most common and highest-grade astrocytoma with uniformly dismal prognosis. In contrast to the lower grade gliomas (grades II and III), GBMs present radial growth rates almost 10 times as fast. Three pathophysiologic features, including necrosis, cellular pseudopalisades surrounding necrosis, and microvascular hyperplasia, are considered as hallmarks for GBM prognosis and are believed to be relevant to the drastically accelerated disease progression. Additionally, a population of Glioma Stem Cells (GCSs) has been found pertinent to the new neovascular formation, leading to GBM tumor outward growth. However, the definitive roles of these pathologic features and the associated signaling networks in GBM progression and their interactive mechanisms remain ill defined, because of limited capacity of biomarker observation and data analysis. The proposed project will create a new avenue for GBM research by leveraging computational power and machine intelligence for analyses of large-scale pathology images and spatially referenced, multiplexed biomarker data. A comprehensive system and analytical infrastructure will be developed to quantitatively investigate 1) spatial distributions f GBM invasion-related pathologic structures and GSCs, 2) functions of the in-situ signaling genes and regulatory networks responsible for GBM progression, and 3) the significance of morphologic, molecular, and signaling network variation across GBM microenvironments. A set of scalable image processing algorithms for analyses of spatial distributions and co-localizations of phenotypic features and biomarkers will be developed and applied to whole-slide pathology brightfield and quantum dot immunohistochemistry images of GBMs. Derived features and boundaries of phenotypic structures, and spatial distributions of biomarkers will be archived and integrated in a database for pathology and in-situ molecular imaging data where scientific queries can be invoked to support the analysis of GBM tumor progression mechanisms. In particular, multiplexed quantum dot immunohistochemistry (mQD-IHC), a new biomarker staining technique, will be leveraged to show the locations and expressions of multiple biomarkers of interest within the same tissue spatial reference. The combined expertise in large-scale pathology image process, high performance data computation, mQD-IHC staining technique for multiplexed biomarker investigation, and phenotype- genotype data integration supported by high-throughput data query power from customized database enables a unique research vehicle to investigate GBM tumor expansion mechanisms. Notably, the proposed research work can be generalized to catalyze other computational cancer research involving large-scale data and phenotype-genotype information integration. Therefore, it will present a broad impact on future translational research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Integrated analysis of spatial configurations of tissue pathologic features and underlying molecular biomarkers accounting for cancer progression is an important way to understand tumor expansion mechanisms. To advance in this research field, I propose to develop automated image analysis tools, database-based spatial integration methods, and mathematical models for tumor microenvironment representation to support quantitative investigations on Glioblastoma (GBM) brain tumor invasion mechanisms with definitive pathology imaging and multiplexed molecular biomarker data from whole-slide images of GBM

"The CSBC Research Center for Cancer Systems Immunology at MSKCC SUMMARY Exciting clinical breakthroughs with checkpoint blockade antibodies and adoptive T cell transfers have transformed the field of cancer immunotherapy, demonstrating the power of harnessing the immune system to eliminate cancer cells. However, fundamental challenges and questions remain. Significant clinical responses have only been observed in a subset of patients and cancer types, and it is currently not known what biological properties of tumors determine clinical responses, nor what strategies to adopt in clinical contexts where current immunotherapies are ineffective. To ultimately address these clinical challenges and to design predictably effective cancer treatments, we must deepen our fundamental understanding of interactions between tumors and the immune system at the molecular, cellular, and systems levels. The CSBC Research Center for Cancer Systems Immunology at MSKCC will bring the tools of systems biology to investigate cancer-immune system interactions at multiple stages of disease progression to answer central questions in cancer immunology and inform the design of novel immunotherapeutic interventions. We have organized our Research Center around three central scientific projects that examine cancer-immune interactions at distinct stages of disease progression: cancer initiation and early tumorigenesis (Project I); established and progressing tumors (Project II); latent disease and metastasis in (Project III). In Project I, we will combine new epigenomics technologies and innovative single-cell analyses with state-of-the-art systems biology approaches to decipher the underlying molecular and epigenetic programs of dysfunctional tumor- specific T cell differentiation in early tumorigenesis. We will further elucidate how dynamics in the mutational tumor antigen landscape and stromal and immune cell populations determine such states and model and test in mouse and human tumors how distinct T cell states determine sensitivity to immune checkpoint blockade. In Project II, we will use quantitative analysis of cell types and cell states by functional, flow cytometric, population RNA-seq and droplet RNA sequencing together with ecological models of cancer, immune, and stromal cell populations to study the response of the tumor ecosystem to immunotherapeutic perturbations in established tumors. In Project III, we will examine the evolutionary dynamics of innate immune system control of metastatic disease, a new area of investigation in cancer immunology. We will investigate the heterogeneity of latent cancer cells in their capacity for immune evasion, and we will use quantitative methods, including live cell imaging, to model latent tumor cell evasion of innate immune control and the dynamics of cycles of latent cell proliferation and potential editing by NK cells. A Shared Resource Core will provide state-of-the-art single-cell droplet sequencing technology and computational analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data (scRNA- seq). This Shared Resource Core will be tasked with droplet sequencing technology development and design of novel algorithmic approaches and will interact with all three scientific Projects. Our Research Center will also carry out an innovative program of outreach and training activities at the local, national, and global levels to disseminate research findings in cancer systems immunology and to train young scientists in this emerging field. NARRATIVE Cancer immunotherapies are designed to harness the human immune system to attack cancer cells and eliminate tumors. Recent breakthroughs in cancer immunotherapy, such as checkpoint blockade agents, have generated great excitement, but in fact only a fraction of patients and tumor types respond to these new treatments. Our proposed Research Center will deploy tools from systems biology to study tumor-immune system interactions at multiple stages to disease progression at the molecular, cellular, and systems levels,

"Towards the automation of MR spectroscopic imaging in patients with glioblashoma Glioblastoma is the most common adult primary brain tumor and is highly aggressive in its disease course. Despite advances in neurosurgical resection, radiation targeting, and chemotherapy, the prognosis remains grim with a median survival of just 15 months. The effectiveness of current radiation therapy strategies is severely limited by shortcomings in the imaging modalities used to develop treatment plans. Current radiation therapy planning is mainly based on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI, which identifies high grade tumors that are immediately associated with leaky neovasculature. Although it is an excellent diagnostic tool to identify high grade from low grade tumors, it is unable to signal occult infiltration beyond the core of the tumor. Though many believe GBM to be an incurable disease, we believe we have identified a method for optimizing tumor targeting that will increase the effectiveness of radiation therapy. A significant component of the current problem in GBM therapy is the lack of treatment for non-enhancing regions that are significantly infiltrated by neoplastic glioma cells without neovascularization. This untreated population undoubtedly leads to early recurrence. The proposed study addresses an important step toward translating an advanced quantitative imaging modality that complements the conventional imaging that is capable of reliably revealing glioma- infiltrated regions for precise, personalized treatment targeting. Proton spectroscopic magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) is an alternative modality able to identify endogenous metabolism within tissue without the need for exogenous contrast, and has been shown to identify the metabolic abnormalities associated with tumor beyond the regions identified by T1-weighted MRI. The clinical integration of sMRI in patient management has been limited due to the computational challenges of analysis of sMRI data. Two key hurdles to be overcome are the insufficiency of filters to remove image artifacts and the necessity of quantification of metabolic levels relative to a patient's baseline metabolism. As a result, sMRI processing requires skilled user intervention and many hours of computational and user time. To automate this pipeline and provide clinically useful information to oncologists, we seek to develop a software framework for the automated and expedient processing of sMRI for use in radiation therapy planning. We will use novel advances in the fields of high performance computing and deep learning, an approach to computation that has shattered benchmarks in many medical and non-medical problems. Specifically, we will develop filters for removing artifacts, algorithms for personalized diagnosis of tumor infiltration, and explore deep learning as a method to synthesize sMRI data with anatomical and clinical metrics in a fully automated fashion. Success in the proposed work will produce a “scanner-to-clinician” platform for quantitative, expedient, and objective analysis methods to integrate sMRI into the clinical radiation therapy planning paradigm. Ultimately, we believe this additional modality in the physician's tool belt will lead to better outcomes in patients suffering from this debilitating disease. Project Narrative  Proton spectroscopic magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) is a molecular imaging modality that can accurately detect abnormalities in the metabolic signatures of tumor cells, making it ideal for the detection and monitoring of highly infiltrative brain tumors like glioblastoma. Clinical adoption of sMRI has been slow due to limited tools for expedient and objective processing of sMRI data into information that oncologists can use for therapy planning. This proposal addresses these challenges using recent advances in high performance computing and machine learning to develop a software framework for using sMRI in the clinical management of patients with glioblastoma.",Towards the automation of MR spectroscopic imaging in patients with glioblashoma,9191930,F30CA206291,"['Accounting ', ' Adoption ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old

"Topology of Cancer Evolution and Heterogeneity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In solid tumors, current limitations in our ability to identify the cell(s) of origin, track the dynamics of tumor subclonal architecture over space and time, and predict drug sensitivities in a mechanistic fashion pose significant challenges to our ability to develop effective treatments and undermine the utility of available therapies, particularly in tumors that become resistant. In this proposal, we argue that approaches based in mathematics and physics are well suited for addressing these critical problems. Historically, the physical sciences have been successful in solving fundamental scientific problems by producing reductionist models that enable the development of conceptual premises, technological breakthroughs that enable new kinds of measurements, and mathematical tools that can accurately represent and predict future activity. In this new Columbia University Physical Sciences-Oncology Center for Topology of Cancer Evolution and Heterogeneity (CUPS-OC), our goal is to develop, validate, and deliver a set of complementary mathematical, technological, and computational approaches that will provide the cancer research community with a framework for unraveling complexity in solid tumors, with the long-term aim of improving diagnosis and treatment. More specifically, the Center's primary research focus will be to study evolution and heterogeneity of solid tumors at the single cell level, by developing lineage tracing techniques in organoid and in vivo systems, single cell sequencing in primary tumors, and emerging genomics-based approaches for identifying targeted therapies. These experimental approaches will be supported by the development of novel, robust, and effective mathematical and computational approaches based in the field of topology, which offers unique and powerful methods for addressing the essential challenge of interpreting the high-dimensional data sets that state-of-the- art genomics technologies generate. In addition, we will promote the integration of physical science approaches into cancer research by both training new researchers and engaging established researchers working at the intersection of the physical sciences and cancer biology. Each of the projects and cores will address technical, mathematical, and biological challenges, contributing to the global enterprise of cancer research and to the development of a broader network of interdisciplinary researchers committed to advancing the field. If successful, we will be able to provide the scientific community with experimentally validated geometric and topological structures of causal inference of clonal evolution, single cell genomic protocols for fast and reliable uncovering of clonal heterogeneity, experimentally validated machine learning approaches for predicting drug sensitivities, and a strong multi-institutional, interdisciplinary program that creates bridges between researchers in pure mathematics, the technology sector, and cancer research.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cancer heterogeneity has been postulated as a major evolutionary force behind drug resistance.

"(PQD-3) Spatiotemporal Molecular Interrogation of Early Metastatic Evolution In Situ ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every single cancer survivor fears relapse. While being free of the primary tumor after treatment is encouraging, it is emotionally devastating to step out of the clinic after a yearly checkup with a diagnosis of metastatic disease. Approximately 90% of cancer lethality is due to metastasis - the spreading of primary tumor cells to distant organs. Despite a dramatic increase in early screening methods and comprehensive treatment regimens for primary breast tumors, the overall mortality of patients who relapsed with metastatic cancer in the US has not changed in the past two decades. Clinical failure in treating metastatic tumors is largely due to the evolutionary nature of tumor metastasis. In order to survive and establish secondary tumors in a different tissue microenvironment at distant organs, disseminated tumor cells have to adapt (metastatic evolution) to the host environment. Clinically, metastatic tumors exhibit drastically different characteristics from their primary counterpart. Therefore, current cancer treatments, designed based on the features of primary tumors, are rarely effective.          Optimal design of breakthrough anti-metastasis therapies relies on our in-depth understanding of the common and functionally important traits during the early metastatic evolution. In this proposed study, we will use breast cancer brain metastasis as model system and take state-of-the-art approaches to trace and analyze a single cancer cell within its precise metastatic microenvironment from the initial moment of metastatic colonization. This collaborative effort from a multidisciplinary team, including a cancer biologist, a computational biologist, a mathematician and a bioinformatician will allow us to: 1) depict the dynamics of gene transcription during the different stages of brain metastasis at single cell level; 2) visualize th behavior of a single colonized metastatic tumor cell and its interaction with the microenvironment through real-time intravital imaging and deep tissue imaging; 3) mathematically integrate molecular (RNA-seq), behavioral (intravital) and structural (deep tissue imaging) information to identify the common and functionally important early metastatic evolutionary traits during the breast cancer brain metastasis in its native tissue context.          Shifting the current clinical treatment model relies on new in-depth mechanistic insight obtained through basic and pre-clinical innovative research. Utilizing cutting-edge sequencing and imaging modality in our proposed study, we will have the capacity to systematically dissect traits of early metastatic behavior and discover potential novel therapeutic targets for paradigm-shifting novel adjuvant therapy tailored to specific target metastatic evolution. The conceptual validation from our bold and pioneering attempt proposed in this study will serves as a blueprint for a new category of adjuvant therapies for effective anti-metastasis treatment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful anti-metastasis treatment is rooted deep in our mechanistic understanding of early metastatic evolution and our capability to stop metastatic progression before aggressive outgrowth occurs. Using single cell transcriptome sequencing and multiplexed single cell deep-tissue imaging, we aim to trace and analyze the lineage dynamics of a single cancer cell within its specific metastatic microenvironment from the initial moment of metastatic colonization. The conceptual advances validated from this study will serve as a blueprint for future adjuvant therapies targeting early metastatic evolution, providing more effective cancer treatments.",(PQD-3) Spatiotemporal Molecular Interrogation of Early Metastatic Evolution In Situ,9067260,R01CA194697,"['post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' Aftercare ', ' Algorithms ', ' Behavior ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' Evolution ', ' Exhibits ', ' Spillage ', ' Leakage ', ' Extravasation ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Methods ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Biological Models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Statistical Models ', ' mortality ', ' tumor cell metastasis ', ' cancer metastasis ', ' Secondary Tumor ', ' Secondary Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Tumor ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Mass ', ' Metastatic Lesion ', ' Metastasize ', ' Metastasis ', ' Neoplasm Metastasis ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' pressure ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Secondary to ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Metastatic Tumor to the Brain ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm to the Brain ', ' Brain Metastasis ', ' Metastatic malignant neoplasm to brain ', ' Failure ', ' insight ', ' Disease Progression ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Cell Structure ', ' Cell Components ', ' Cellular Structures ', ' Oncologist ', ' Metabolism Studies ', ' Metabolic Studies ', ' Abnormal Assessment of Metabolism ', ' metabolic abnormality assessment ', ' Staging ', ' Malignant Cell ', ' cancer cell ', ' Metastatic Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Cancer ', ' Disseminated Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Nature ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' Distant ', ' In Situ ', ' Tumor Cell ', ' neoplastic cell ', ' success ', ' checkup ', ' Check-up ', ' checkup examination ', ' trait ', ' Adjuvant Therapy ', ' Primary Tumor ', ' Primary Neoplasm ', ' novel ', ' Categories ', ' Modeling ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer therapy ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Address ', ' mammary tumor ', ' Mammary Cancer ', ' Breast Tumors ', ' Breast Neoplasms ', ' Mammary Neoplasms ', ' Data ', ' in vivo ', ' survive cancer ', ' Cancer Survivor ', ' trial treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' data integration ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' pre-clinical research ', ' preclinical research ', ' therapeutic target ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' tumor ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' novel therapy target ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' novel pharmacotherapy target ', ' novel drug target ', ' new therapy target ', ' new pharmacotherapy target ', ' new drug target ', ' clinical practice ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' screening ', ' intravital imaging ', ' intra-vital imaging ', ' 4D Imaging ', ' four-dimensional imaging ', ' 4-D imaging ', ' glutamatergic signaling ', ' glutamatergic dendrodendritic synapses ', ' glutamate signaling ', ' transcriptome ', ' Tissue imaging ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME,R01,2016,347700,IN-02,0.07027368504531031
"Predicting brain tumor progression via multiparametric image analysis and modelin DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High-grade brain gliomas, the most common of which is glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), have terrible prognosis and a median patient survival of about 12 months. Although combinations of surgical removal, radiotherapy and chemotherapy are used in the clinical practice, a  fundamental and persistent limitation in treating these aggressive tumors is that they tend to  infiltrate into normal tissue well beyond margins visible via imaging. Since assessing the spatial  extent of tumor infiltration is nearly impossible using current radiologic reading practices, clinical  treatment tends to be restricted to parts that are deemed to be clearly malignant, frequently only  the enhancing tumor. This failure to aggressively treat the infiltrating tumor accelerates tumor  recurrence, and eventually patient death. This proposal aims to develop computational modeling  and image analysis methods that will improve our ability to estimate GBM infiltration, as well as  to predict tissue that is likelyto present fastest tumor recurrence, thereby eventually opening the  way for more aggressive, yet targeted, treatment, such as targeted aggressive surgical removal  and/or radiosurgery. To achieve our goal, we will integrate information from several sources:  1)  advanced multi-parametric imaging, which captures many aspects of tumor anatomy and  physiology~ 2) computational modeling of tumor growth and infiltration~ 3) machine learning  methods which, after appropriate training, can learn subtle and potentially complex imaging  phenotypes of infiltrating tumors~ 4) statistical atlases, which capture population-based trends  that can offer additional insights into tumor growth, such as relationship of infiltration to  vasculature and to white matter fiber pathways~ 5) data from one of the largest patient  populations having advanced imaging, genotyping, follow-up till tumor recurrence, and  histological analysis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop advance computational imaging and informatics methods for analysis  of high-grade gliomas (brain tumors). It will compile a unique database of data from several  hundred patients and will construct predictive models of infiltrating malignant tumor and of later  recurrence. Therefore, it will pave the way for more refined and targeted treatments of peritumoral brain tissue, which is where most tumor recurrence occurs.",Predicting brain tumor progression via multiparametric image analysis and modelin,9095431,R01NS042645,"['Accounting ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomy ', ' Atlases ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' Biophysics ', ' Biopsy ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' tumors in the brain ', ' Brain Tumors ', ' Brain Neoplasia ', ' Brain Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Communities ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Hydrops ', ' Dropsy ', ' Edema ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Future ', ' Genotype ', ' spongioblastoma multiforme ', ' glioblastoma multiforme ', ' Grade IV Astrocytoma ', ' Grade IV Astrocytic Tumor ', ' Grade IV Astrocytic Neoplasm ', ' Glioblastoma ', ' neuroglia tumor ', ' neuroglia neoplasm ', ' glial-derived tumor ', ' Neuroglial Tumor ', ' Neuroglial Neoplasm ', ' Glial Tumor ', ' Glial Neoplasm ', ' Glial Cell Tumors ', ' Glioma ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolism ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physiology ', ' preservation ', ' Biologic Preservation ', ' Biological Preservation ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' treatment with radiation ', ' radio-therapy ', ' radiation treatment ', ' Radiotherapy ', ' Radiotherapeutics ', ' Radiation therapy ', ' Reading ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' statistics ', ' Technology ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Vascularization ', ' Work ', ' Radiosurgery ', ' radio-surgery ', ' Sterotactic External Beam Radiation ', ' Stereotaxic Radiosurgery ', ' Stereotactic Radiosurgery ', ' Stereotactic External Beam Irradiation ', ' Radiation Surgery ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Cell Density ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' cancer progression ', ' tumor progression ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Clinical ', ' Malignant ', ' Malignant -

"Multi-parametric 4-D Imaging Biomarkers for Neoadjuvant Treatment Response ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Imaging plays a critical role in evaluating tumor response to treatment; however the currently used methods remain significantly limited. For example, standards such as the RECIST are subjective and cannot be used to adequately characterize irregular lesions; tumor volume measures alone do not account for detailed structural changes; and features from selected tumor regions, such as ""hot-spot"" peak-enhancement, do not capture information from the entire tumor. As such, current approaches fall short of capturing the multi-faceted effects of treatment, including phenotypic tumor heterogeneity and its longitudinal change during treatment, which is increasingly recognized as an important predictive indicator. To date, few studies have explored using richer imaging descriptors, which could result in more powerful predictive markers. Moreover, fewer have attempted to combine multi-modal biomarkers, such as imaging with histopathologic and molecular markers, to develop enhanced predictive models for specific tumor sub-types and individual patients. We propose to develop advanced computational tools that will enable to i) extract novel multi-parametric imaging signatures and ii) accurately characterize their longitudinal patterns of change during neoadjuvant treatment via deformable image registration. Our approach is thus geared towards knowledge discovery, for determining which imaging parameters have the highest predictive value out of many possible ways to quantify information provided by imaging. In SA1 we will develop robust 4D deformable image registration methods, based on principles of mutual saliency, for estimating transformations that will enable us to robustly register serial imaging scans and obtain anatomically precise spatio-temporal parametric maps of longitudinal tissue effects induced by treatment. In SA2 we will analyze whole-tumor and normal tissue effects by performing multi- parametric feature extraction, including a rich set of morphologic, textural, kinetic and parenchymal tissue descriptors, which in conjunction to registration will allow us to comprehensively capture the dynamically evolving imaging phenotype during treatment. In SA3 we will test our method in a major breast imaging study, the I-SPY 1/ACRIN 6657 trial. We will apply machine learning tools to identify high-dimensional associations of imaging patterns, in conjunction to histopathologic tumor subtyping, that can best predict pathologic complete response (pCR) and 5-year disease free survival (DFS). In SA4 we will independently test our models with the I-SPY 2/ACRIN 6698 trial, where we will also evaluate the robustness of our features to a diverse range of treatments. Our methods hold the promise to shift the current paradigm in personalizing neoadjuvant treatment by 1) improving the current standards of imaging-based assessment and 2) introducing new imaging biomarkers that can be of higher value as early predictors of treatment response and survival. Our tools will be shared as open-source software via NIH/NCI tool registries and open-challenge activities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Pattern analysis and machine learning methods are powerful knowledge discovery tools that can be very effective in identifying complex multi-parametric patterns from a diverse set of imaging and non-imaging biomarkers that can best predict treatment response and outcome. Our method will leverage the richness of available data to point to new imaging biomarkers that are better early predictors of response, enabling personalized treatment decisions for women undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer.        ",Multi-parametric 4-D Imaging Biomarkers for Neoadjuvant Treatment Response,9106459,R01CA197000,"['Accounting ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' indexing ', ' Kinetics ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Registries ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Soft Tissue Tumor ', ' Soft Tissue Neoplasms ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Training Support ', ' Tumor Markers ', ' tumor specific biomarker ', ' tumor biomarker ', ' TM-MKR ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' falls ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Diffuse ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' Residual Cancers ', ' Event-Free Survival ', ' Disease-Free Survival ', ' Descriptor ', ' angiogenesis ', ' Normal Tissue ', ' Normal tissue morphology ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Scanning ', ' Pattern ', ' Tumor Volume ', ' Tumor Tissue ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Visit ', ' Performance ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' receptor ', ' Neoadjuvant Treatment ', ' Neoadjuvant ', ' NEOADJ ', ' Induction Therapy ', ' Neoadjuvant Therapy ', ' complete response ', ' In complete remission ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' MRI Scans ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' predictive of drug response ', ' prediction of response ', ' Prediction of Response to Therapy ', ' Predictive Value ', ' ACRIN ', ' American College of Radiology Imaging Network ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Tumor Expansion ', ' Tumor Subtype ', ' Pathologic ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Hot Spot ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' image registration ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' treatment effect ', ' open source ', ' chemotherapy ', ' tumor ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' novel therapy target ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' novel pharmacotherapy target ', ' novel drug target ', ' new therapy target ', ' new pharmacotherapy target ', ' new drug target ', ' public health relevance ', ' treatment response ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' molecular marker ', ' molecular biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' arm ', ' Knowledge Discovery ', ' 4D Imaging ', ' four-dimensional imaging ', ' 4-D imaging ', ' individualized medicine ', ' unique treatment ', ' tailored treatment ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' individualized treatment ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' customized treatment ', ' customized therapy ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' predictive marker ', ' predictive molecular biomarker ', ' predictive biomarkers ', ' breast imaging ', ' mammary imaging ', ' imaging biomarker ', ' imaging marker ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' predicting response ', ' response prediction ', ' predictor of response ', ' predictive response ', ' individual patient ', ' tumor heterogeneity ', ' intratumor heterogeneity ', ' intra-tumoral heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneity in tumors ', ' Intratumoral heterogeneity ', ' predictive of treatment response ', ' treatment response prediction ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2016,498724,PA-03,0.08168234182428988
"Biomarkers for Staging and Treatment Response Monitoring of Bladder Cancer DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Bladder cancer is a common type of cancer that can cause substantial morbidity and mortality among both men and women. Bladder cancer causes over 15,210 deaths per year in the United States. It is estimated that 72,570 new bladder cancer cases will be diagnosed in 2013. Correct staging of the bladder cancer is crucial for the decision of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and minimizing the risk of under-treatment or over-treatment. A reliable assessment of the response to neoadjuvant therapy at an early stage is vital for identifying tumors that do not respond and allowing the patient a chance of alternative treatment. MRI and CT are important methods for pre-treatment staging or treatment response monitoring for a variety of bladder cancers. CT is an effective non-invasive modality for measuring primary site gross tumor volume (GTV) and the addition of MRI is on the rise. GTV has been used as a biomarker for predicting treatment outcome of bladder tumors. Other pathological information and diagnostic test (bimanual evaluation, cystoscopy) results and immunohistochemical biomarkers are also useful for staging and treatment response monitoring. The goal of this project is to develop effective decision support tools that merge image-based and non-image-based biomarkers to assist radiologists and oncologists in assessment of cancer stage and change as a result of treatment. We will (1) develop a quantitative image analysis tool (QIBC) for bladder GTV estimation on multi-modality (MM) images, (2) develop a computer decision support system (CDSS-S) to assist clinicians in cancer staging, (3) develop a computer decision support system (CDSS-T) to assist clinicians in evaluation of the change in the tumor characteristics as a result of neoadjuvant treatment, (4) evaluate the effects of QIBC and CDSS-T on inter-clinician variability and efficiency in estimation of GTV and treatment response, and (5) evaluate CDSS-S and CDSS-T as decision support tools in pilot clinical studies. We hypothesize that the use of QIBC, CDSS-S and CDSS-T can improve the clinicians' accuracy, consistency and efficiency in bladder GTV estimation on MM imaging exams, the assessment of bladder cancer stage and response to treatment. To test our hypothesis, we will perform the following specific tasks: (1) to collect a database of multi-modality MR, CT exams of bladder cancers for development, training and testing of the QIBC and CDSS algorithms; (2) to develop advanced computer vision techniques to quantitatively estimate bladder GTV and image characteristics; (3) to develop predictive models using machine learning techniques to combine MM image-based, pathological and immunohistochemical biomarkers for cancer staging and determination of non-responders; (4) to compare the inter-clinician variability and efficiency in clinicians' estimation of GTV and treatment response with and without the proposed QIBC and CDSS-T by observer studies; and (5) to evaluate the CDSS-S and CDSS-T as decision support tools in pilot clinical studies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: If successfully developed, the CDSS-S and CDSS-T can serve as non-invasive, objective, and reproducible clinical decision support systems for cancer staging and treatment response monitoring. Correct staging of the bladder cancer is crucial for the decision of chemotherapy treatment and minimizing the risk of under-treatment or over-treatment. If the response to chemotherapy can be estimated accurately it is possible to identify those patients that do not respond, stop the treatment early, and seek alternative treatment. In addition, although we will focus on the specific application to the bladder tumors in this proposed project, we will design the decision support tools in a modular, expandable, and re-trainable framework. The software package will be versatile and is adaptable to other tumor types or imaging modalities in the future by proper retraining with case samples of the tumor type of interest and expansion of the decision support tools as needed. Therefore, the development of the CDSS-S and CDSS-T will potentially benefit not only the bladder tumor patients but also patients with other tumor types that require staging and monitoring of treatment response.",Biomarkers for Staging and Treatment Response Monitoring of Bladder Cancer,9067256,U01CA179106,"['post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' Aftercare ', ' Algorithms ', ' urinary bladder ', ' Bladder Urinary System ', ' Bladder ', ' Urinary Bladder Malignant Tumor ', ' Urinary Bladder Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Bladder ', ' Malignant Bladder Neoplasm ', ' Bladder Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder ', ' Urinary Bladder Tumor ', ' Urinary Bladder Neoplasm ', ' Bladder Tumors ', ' Bladder Neoplasm ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' in situ cancer ', ' Preinvasive Carcinoma ', ' Intraepithelial Carcinoma ', ' Carcinoma in Situ ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' computer vision ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' Computers ', ' Cystoscopy ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' indexing ', ' Interobserver Variations ', ' Inter-Observer Variation ', ' Inter-Observer Variability ', ' Interobserver Variability ', ' Libraries ', ' breast mass ', ' Breast Nodule ', ' Breast Lump ', ' Mass in breast ', ' Nodular Lymphoma ', ' Giant Follicular Lymphoma ', "" Follicular Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma "", ' Follicle Center Lymphoma ', ' Brill-Symmers Disease ', ' Follicular Lymphoma ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Minor ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' muscular ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' Muscle ', ' Necrotic ', ' Necrosis ', ' Tumor Staging ', ' Neoplasm Staging ', ' Cancer Staging ', ' Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Genitourinary system ', ' Urogenital System ', ' Urogenital ', ' Genitourinary ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Biochemical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Oncologist ', ' RDST ', ' radiologist ', ' Descriptor ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Texture ', ' Techniques ', ' Test Result ', ' Head and Neck ', ' Head and neck structure ', ' Tumor Volume ', ' Tumor Tissue ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' palpable disease ', ' Palpable ', ' Clinical Decision Support Systems ', ' interest ', ' Neoadjuvant Treatment ', ' Neoadjuvant ', ' NEOADJ ', ' Induction Therapy ', ' Neoadjuvant Therapy ', ' novel ', ' Modality ', ' Sampling ', ' Decision Support Systems ', ' response ', ' cancer location ', ' cancer site ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer therapy ', ' Institution ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Lymphovascular ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' computerized ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' cancer type ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid ', ' caBIG ', ' open source ', ' computer monitor ', ' chemotherapy ', ' tumor ', ' multimodality ', ' alternative treatment ', ' treatment response ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' oncology program ', ' quantitative imaging ', ' contrast enhanced ', ' imaging biomarker ', ' imaging marker ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' support tools ', ' interactive tool ', ' responders and non-responders ', ' responders vs non-responders ', ' responders versus non-responders ', ' responders or non-responders ', ' responders from non-responders ', ' immunohistochemical markers ', ' immunohistochemical biomarkers ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2016,549985,MI-12,0.09527429587435889
"Proteogenomic Data Analysis for Cancer Systems Biology and Clinical Translation PROJECT SUMMARY It has become feasible to generate deep quantitative data for many of the molecules that are functional in cells, making it possible to survey a large number of tumors measuring genomic alterations and changes to transcripts, proteins and metabolites. It is, however, not clear what is the best way to integrate these data sets to extract as much information as possible about the biology that drives the cancer and how to best disrupt the tumor growth. Our proposed Proteogenomic Data Analysis Center for Cancer Systems Biology and Clinical Translation will develop new methods for better analyzing and integrating these data sets.

"Targeting Tumors with NF1 Loss ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Genomic information can allow investigators to devise precision therapies that target molecular lesions specific to a patient's cancer. One of the molecular lesions present in many malignant tumors is loss of the NF1 tumor suppressor, which is a driver in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), one of the most frequently inherited genetic disorders. NF1 exhibits a broad clinical spectrum including benign nervous system tumors called neurofibromas, low-grade astrocytomas, pheochromocytoma, and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. Plexiform neurofibromas (PN) occur in deep nerves and can degenerate into malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), chemo- and radiation-resistant sarcomas with a dismal 20% five-year survival rate. In NF1 carriers, the lifetime risk is 30% for PN and 8-15% for MPNST. NF1 mutations are also found in sporadic tumors including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), melanoma, pheochromocytoma, ovarian, uterine, and lung cancers. Furthermore, in animal models and human tumor lines NF1 loss has been shown to drive GBM. A targeted molecular therapy designed to inhibit tumor-initiating and -promoting cells would substantially advance our ability to treat tumors that develop as a result of NF1 loss. Using complementary screening platforms, we identified small molecules that selectively killed or stopped the growth of cells carrying a mutation in NF1 as well as their molecular targets. In this application we focus on our top small molecule leads and the power of our model systems to test the hypothesis that aggressive neurological cancers that are known to be driven by NF1 loss and for which no cure exists, including PN, MPNST and GBM, will respond to molecules that we identified as synthetic lethal with NF1 loss. For this, we will determine pharmacokinetic properties of our top small molecule leads and, where needed, conduct structure-activity relationship studies to improve kinetics and/or reduce toxicity in order to test their efficacy in pre-clinical models of PN and GBM. We will leverage our model systems to define the mechanisms of action of our small molecule leads and add to our pipeline drugs in clinical trials that share the same targets. In addition to mutational inactivation, some GBM tumors exhibit down-regulation of the NF1 protein. Our lead compounds also stopped the growth of human GBM and neuroblastoma cells with low NF1 protein in vitro, supporting the broad application of the small molecule leads that we have identified. To capture tumors that have lost NF1 by any mechanism, we constructed an RNA-based classifier, which is capable of identifying downstream transcriptomic effects that indicate NF1 inactivation in GBM, using machine learning. We will apply the RNA-based classifier, along with targeted sequencing of NF1, to identify additional patient derived xenograft (PDX) GBM tumors that have an inactivating mutation of NF1 or molecular signatures of NF1 loss and test their response to our lead compounds in pre-clinical models. We expect that this work will provide new targets and therapeutic leads for aggressive neurological cancers driven by NF1 loss.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The work described in this proposal aims to find the Achilles heel of aggressive neurological cancers driven by NF1 loss for which no cure exists. These cancers include neurofibromas, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, glioblastoma (GBM), and neuroblastomas, all with dismal 5-year survival rates. Our multidisciplinary approach to develop an innovative conduit for identifying new targets with potential to cure such malignancies addresses an unmet clinical need.            ",Targeting Tumors

"Objective decision support environment for clinical trials DESCRIPTION:  Brain tumors are the second- and fifth-most common cause of cancer death in males and females under 40, respectively. The 5-year relative survival rate is only 33%, even after decades of research into new treatments. Imaging based on ""virtual biopsy"" can provide information about the entire lesion in a minimally or non-invasive way. Prior work by our group has demonstrated that image processing methods applied to serial examinations together (as opposed to applying them to individual examinations) can make subtle changes in brain tumors more apparent, allowing earlier detection of progression. We see the union of virtual biopsy methods and change detection methods as an innovative and powerful combination that our team is uniquely qualified to develop and evaluate. In this application, we will implement several feature selection (FS) methods in a tool that is ""image friendly"". This tool will help select informative features from images; apply a wide range of existing ML algorithms to determine which features are important predictors of therapy response, and to evaluate the impact of a decision support application using these features and ML in a clinical trial. The final stage of th proposal will test the decision support tools in 3 clinical scenarios to see if they are able to significantly improve the decision making of clinicians in a clinical trial.  The long-term goal of this proposal is to develop virtual biopsy technology that will enhance the clinical decision making process by providing tools for investigation of image-based therapy response assessment tools, that may also have some ability to predict outcome. We hope to apply the technology to other organ systems and other imaging technologies. We anticipate this project will impact clinical trials by enabling investigation of alternative outcome measures that are objectively assessed using algorithm evaluation methods. Such a toolset should be useful to the entire cancer imaging community to help evaluate features in old and new imaging technologies that correlate with patient survival. As such, this is ideal for helping the Quantitative Imaging Network (QIN) achieve its goals. The selection of features that reflect response to therapy has long been the domain of the clinical radiologist. When imaging was relatively straightforward (e.g. a chest X-ray of lung cancer), a measurement or a visual assessment was a reasonable metric. Today, advanced imaging devices produce large amounts of data that reflect a range of properties. In this work, we build on previous work developing computer techniques for identifying and characterizing changes in brain tumors, using MRI. In this proposal, we will focus on building 1) a high quality database of brain cancer imaging, clinical data, ""-omic"" data, outcomes data; 2) a library of easily accessed tools for computing features that might be important predictors of tumor response; 3) a tool that will help objectively establish the feature() that are valuable through a variety of machine learning methods; and 4) use the above to create a decision support tool that will be used in 3 clinical trial situations.",Objective decision support environment for clinical trials,9143689,U01CA160045,"['Algorithms ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' tumors in the brain ', ' Brain Tumors ', ' Brain Neoplasia ', ' Brain Neoplasms ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Decision Making ', ' Environment ', ' Female ', ' Goals ', ' Libraries ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' male ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' thorax radiography ', ' thoracic radiogram ', ' radiographic lung image ', ' radiographic chest image ', ' lung radiography ', ' chest radiography ', ' chest Xray ', ' chest X ray ', ' CXR ', ' Thoracic Radiography ', ' Work ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Malignant neoplasm of brain ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Brain ', ' Brain Cancer ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' improved ', ' brain visualization ', ' Brain imaging ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Lesion ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' Measurement ', ' RDST ', ' radiologist ', ' Differentiation Therapy ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Investigation ', ' Techniques ', ' Organ System ', ' body system ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Primary Brain Tumors ', ' Primary Brain Neoplasms ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Imaging Tool ', ' Imaging Instrument ', ' Imaging Device ', ' Qualifying ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Collection ', ' Pathologic ', ' Process ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Output ', ' Outcome ', ' cancer imaging ', ' tumor imaging ', ' Imaging technology ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' tumor ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' quantitative imaging ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' support tools ', ' interactive tool ', ' predicting response ', ' response prediction ', ' predictor of response ', ' predictive response ', ' virtual biopsy ', ' ']",NCI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,U01,2016,522865,MN-01,0.07828513749825629
"Systems Biology of Tumor Progression and Drug Resistance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The emergence of multidimensional datasets characterizing genetic, epigenetic, and functional properties of large normal and tumor-related samples is creating unique opportunities for the systems-level dissection of mechanisms associated with malignant phenotypes. Coupled with novel high-throughput technologies and computational methodologies for the dissection, interrogation, and perturbation of genome-wide regulatory pathways, this will lead to highly efficient approaches for the rapid identification and validation of therapeutic targets, their small molecule inhibitors, and associated biomarkers. Columbia University investigators have pioneered systems-biology-based approaches for the dissection of regulatory networks in human malignancies and for their interrogation, using computational, RNAi, and small-molecule approaches, to identify molecular targets for therapeutic intervention. The goal of this project is the use and build upon a successful pipeline between the investigators labs for the discovery and validation of master regulator modules that implement functional bottlenecks that integrate aberrant signals from multiple genetic and epigenetic alterations, and thus, constitute natural dependencies (i.e., Achille's heel) for the tumor subtype. These will be characterized in terms of their synergistic behavior, driver genetic alterations, and druggable modulators. This pipeline will allow processing of a novel tumor phenotype every 18 to 24 months, yielding validated individual and synergistic targets that constitute either oncogene or non-oncogene dependencies of the tumor or that increase sensitivity to existing FDA approved or late-stage development compounds. Relevance: The identification of targets that abrogate tumorigenesis in the patient, are extensively biochemically characterized, chemically tractable, and highly penetrant constitutes one of the greatest challenges of cancer research. The goal of this proposal is to leverage an integrative computational and experimental pipeline for the systematic identification of novel potential targets that may inspire future development of therapeutic applications.

"Integrative Cancer Genomics: Drivers, Pathways and Drugs DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The emergence of cancer genomics, combined with increased understanding of the molecular basis of oncogenesis, has stimulated hope that treatment will improve by becoming more targeted and individualized in nature. Cancer genomics studies established a number of critical cancer genes, leading to a number of successful targeted therapies (e.g. Gleevec, Herceptin and Plexxikon). Despite these successes, most cancers do not have a targeted therapy and when one exists, response is highly variable, even among patients that share the targeted mutation and tumor type. To move cancer into the era of personalized therapies, it becomes important to identify the alterations driving tumor progression in each tumor, determine the network that links these aberrations, and identify factors that predict sensitivity to targeted therapies. As projects such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) amass cancer cell genomes at a breathtaking pace, a staggering genetic complexity is revealed. To interpret cancer genomes, a key computational challenge is to separate the wheat from the chaff and define both what are the key alterations likely to be functionally driving cancer and then, after defining such genes, begin to identify mechanisms of action and therapeutic implications. Leveraging components from our published methods, CONEXIC (Akavia et.al Cell 2010) and LirNet (Lee et.al, PLOS Gen 2009), we will develop machine-learning algorithms that integrate cancer genomic data to do just that. We will apply the methods we develop to melanoma, glioblastoma, ovarian, breast and colon cancer and experimentally follow up on our computational findings, towards a better understanding of each of these deadly cancers. The approaches developed in this grant will accelerate discovery to rapidly extract the maximal value from modern genomic studies and help carry cancer genomics from the diagnostic to the therapeutic realm. This work aims to develop methods that help dissect the genetic complexity of individual cancers. For each tumor we aim to identify which mutations arm a cell with the abilities to abnormally grow or evade drug treatment, providing a foundation of tools towards personalized cancer treatment. We will apply these methods for discovery in some of the most aggressive cancers that currently lack good therapeutic solutions including glioblastoma, ovarian cancer and melanoma.","Integrative

"Quantitative PET/CT Analysis to Improve Evaluation of Tumor Response DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose to develop and validate a quantitative Positron Emission Tomography / Computed Tomography (PET/CT) image analysis framework to improve the evaluation of esophageal tumor response to chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer. In Aim 1, we will extract comprehensive spatial and temporal features of a tumor from PET/CT images and evaluate their ability in predicting tumor response to CRT. These features will quantify the spatial characteristics of a tumor along with their changes due to CRT, adding a great amount of information to the current non-volumetric PET/CT response measures. Also, we will use image registration techniques to align pre-CRT images with post-CRT images, making it possible to quantify the spatial changes at the original tumor site. In Aim 2, we will construct and test reliable predictive models of tumo response to CRT using machine learning techniques with spatial- temporal PET/CT features, clinical parameters and demographics as input. The models will identify an optimal subset of predictive features and utilize PET and CT information in chorus. In Aim 3, we will develop a novel multi-modality adaptive region-growing algorithm for tumor delineation in PET/CT. We will compare the accuracy and precision of the resulting predictive models against those in which tumor is delineated using conventional methods (manual contouring or thresholding). This comparison will help us understand to what degree the prediction of tumor response depends on the tumor delineation methods. Finally, we will use pathologic response and survival as the end points and ground truth to cross-validate each predictive model. If all aims are achieved, the proposed PET/CT image analysis framework may provide a highly accurate diagnostic tool. This, will complement other diagnostic tests in assisting physicians in making a treatment decision to more appropriately select patients for surgery, thus avoiding the mortality and morbidity of surgery in responders for whom surgery can be safely deferred; while improving local control and survival in non- responders for whom surgery should be considered. Therefore, this work has the potential to improve outcomes by safely deferring surgery which will improve our locally advanced esophageal cancer patient's quality of life while simultaneously reducing costs.

"Online Raman Diagnostics of Oncometabolites Project Abstract  Cancer cells utilize normal metabolic processes out of context to promote tumor survival. For example, Otto Warburg and others discovered that tumors have increased glucose uptake, glycolysis, and lactate production, often with a reduction in citric acid cycle. While “aerobic glycolysis” at first glance is energetically expensive for tumor cells because it circumvents high ATP production from the citric acid cycle, it allows cancer cells to survive under low nutrient or low oxygen conditions and to instead use glycolytic intermediates for the synthesis of essential cellular building blocks without further energy investment. This change in metabolite regulation suggests a powerful method for monitoring and diagnosing cancer.  This project seeks to develop surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) as online detection method for the characterization of metabolites from breast cancer tumor models. Using the SERS results from tumor lysates, diagnostic algorithms will be constructed to improve treatment for cancer. Results show that fluid dynamics can be used to increase the reproducibility and sensitivity of SERS detection in flowing liquids. We propose to develop methodology to enable the use this innovation to investigate metabolites in cancer cell lysates using capillary electrophoresis coupled to a SERS flow detector. We will investigate known metabolites that have been linked to cancer, as well as examine key metabolites associated with oncogenes. The SERS data collected will be used to formulate diagnostic algorithms that can provide a yes/no indicator of cancer.  The specific aims of this project are as follows:  · AIM 1. Demonstrate the utility of the novel flow detector to assess changes in key metabolites from  tumor cell lysates. The tumor cell lysates will be compared with non-cancerous cell lysates to  identify trends in these metabolites relevant to breast cancer.  · AIM 2. Compare the identification and quantification capabilities with the current gold standard, LC-  MS. This aim will assess how SERS characterization both compares with existing technology but  also increases coverage of the metabolome.  · AIM 3. We will use the metabolites to develop statistical machine learning algorithms to predict the  sample label (cancer or not). The predictor obtained will be used as a diagnostic tool of cancer. The development of new technologies that provide unique chemical specific information will enable improved diagnostic assays for the treatment of cancer. Relevance to Public Health. The proposed research seeks to develop new technology for the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. Cancer exhibits misregulation of metabolic process relative to normal cells.

"Multi-parametric 4-D Imaging Biomarkers for Neoadjuvant Treatment Response ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Imaging plays a critical role in evaluating tumor response to treatment; however the currently used methods remain significantly limited. For example, standards such as the RECIST are subjective and cannot be used to adequately characterize irregular lesions; tumor volume measures alone do not account for detailed structural changes; and features from selected tumor regions, such as ""hot-spot"" peak-enhancement, do not capture information from the entire tumor. As such, current approaches fall short of capturing the multi-faceted effects of treatment, including phenotypic tumor heterogeneity and its longitudinal change during treatment, which is increasingly recognized as an important predictive indicator. To date, few studies have explored using richer imaging descriptors, which could result in more powerful predictive markers. Moreover, fewer have attempted to combine multi-modal biomarkers, such as imaging with histopathologic and molecular markers, to develop enhanced predictive models for specific tumor sub-types and individual patients. We propose to develop advanced computational tools that will enable to i) extract novel multi-parametric imaging signatures and ii) accurately characterize their longitudinal patterns of change during neoadjuvant treatment via deformable image registration. Our approach is thus geared towards knowledge discovery, for determining which imaging parameters have the highest predictive value out of many possible ways to quantify information provided by imaging. In SA1 we will develop robust 4D deformable image registration methods, based on principles of mutual saliency, for estimating transformations that will enable us to robustly register serial imaging scans and obtain anatomically precise spatio-temporal parametric maps of longitudinal tissue effects induced by treatment. In SA2 we will analyze whole-tumor and normal tissue effects by performing multi- parametric feature extraction, including a rich set of morphologic, textural, kinetic and parenchymal tissue descriptors, which in conjunction to registration will allow us to comprehensively capture the dynamically evolving imaging phenotype during treatment. In SA3 we will test our method in a major breast imaging study, the I-SPY 1/ACRIN 6657 trial. We will apply machine learning tools to identify high-dimensional associations of imaging patterns, in conjunction to histopathologic tumor subtyping, that can best predict pathologic complete response (pCR) and 5-year disease free survival (DFS). In SA4 we will independently test our models with the I-SPY 2/ACRIN 6698 trial, where we will also evaluate the robustness of our features to a diverse range of treatments. Our methods hold the promise to shift the current paradigm in personalizing neoadjuvant treatment by 1) improving the current standards of imaging-based assessment and 2) introducing new imaging biomarkers that can be of higher value as early predictors of treatment response and survival. Our tools will be shared as open-source software via NIH/NCI tool registries and open-challenge activities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Pattern analysis and machine learning methods are powerful knowledge discovery tools that can be very effective in identifying complex multi-parametric patterns from a diverse set of imaging and non-imaging biomarkers that can best predict treatment response and outcome. Our method will leverage the richness of available data to point to new imaging biomarkers that are better early predictors of response, enabling personalized treatment decisions for women undergoing

"UCSC-Buck Specialized Genomic Data Analysis Center for the Genomic Data Analysis Network The “UCSC-Buck Genome Data Analysis Center for the Genomic Data Analysis Network” will develop state-of-the-art methods for integrating various types of data to discover the genetic pathways, the microenvironment, the originating cells, and the oncogenic processes driving the initiation and progression of tumors. The long term goals of the project are to identify highly accurate models detailing the faulty genetic circuitry at work in each subclone of a patient’s tumor, as well as any “normal” cells acting as accomplices by supporting the cancer microenvironment. The ultimate objective is to encode computer algorithms that can search a patient’s individual pathway diagram for the best combination of interventions to eliminate every tumor cell, while preserving the health of every normal cell, in their body. Integrative pathway analysis methods will be developed to reveal signatures of tumor subtypes from Pan-Cancer and external datasets. New technologies will be established for uncovering network models tailored to individual patients. The tools will be deployed as part of an active collaboration to support the specific projects of the Genome Data Analysis Network. Novel probabilistic graphical models will be used to infer disrupted signaling. Cellular signatures will be collected from the analysis of normal cells, cancer cell line models, and Pan-Cancer investigations. Novel machine-learning methods, guided by pathway mechanisms, will be established to identify cell state signatures in heterogeneous patient samples. This work will reveal rare mutations driving metastatic transformation that are currently of unknown significance. New clues about the genetic circuitry promoting response and resistance to treatment will be established. Finally, cross-tumor connections that relate tumors of one type to a different type will suggest new avenues for treatment. Computational strategies for interpreting the results of cancer genome sequencing projects are in  desperate need. To select appropriate treatment strategies for a patient, an accurate model of the  altered genetic wiring in the tumor is needed as well as how that wiring relates to other tumors  and to other normal cells at various stages of differentiation.

"(PQD-3) Spatiotemporal Molecular Interrogation of Early Metastatic Evolution In Situ ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every single cancer survivor fears relapse. While being free of the primary tumor after treatment is encouraging, it is emotionally devastating to step out of the clinic after a yearly checkup with a diagnosis of metastatic disease. Approximately 90% of cancer lethality is due to metastasis - the spreading of primary tumor cells to distant organs. Despite a dramatic increase in early screening methods and comprehensive treatment regimens for primary breast tumors, the overall mortality of patients who relapsed with metastatic cancer in the US has not changed in the past two decades. Clinical failure in treating metastatic tumors is largely due to the evolutionary nature of tumor metastasis. In order to survive and establish secondary tumors in a different tissue microenvironment at distant organs, disseminated tumor cells have to adapt (metastatic evolution) to the host environment. Clinically, metastatic tumors exhibit drastically different characteristics from their primary counterpart. Therefore, current cancer treatments, designed based on the features of primary tumors, are rarely effective.          Optimal design of breakthrough anti-metastasis therapies relies on our in-depth understanding of the common and functionally important traits during the early metastatic evolution. In this proposed study, we will use breast cancer brain metastasis as model system and take state-of-the-art approaches to trace and analyze a single cancer cell within its precise metastatic microenvironment from the initial moment of metastatic colonization. This collaborative effort from a multidisciplinary team, including a cancer biologist, a computational biologist, a mathematician and a bioinformatician will allow us to: 1) depict the dynamics of gene transcription during the different stages of brain metastasis at single cell level; 2) visualize th behavior of a single colonized metastatic tumor cell and its interaction with the microenvironment through real-time intravital imaging and deep tissue imaging; 3) mathematically integrate molecular (RNA-seq), behavioral (intravital) and structural (deep tissue imaging) information to identify the common and functionally important early metastatic evolutionary traits during the breast cancer brain metastasis in its native tissue context.          Shifting the current clinical treatment model relies on new in-depth mechanistic insight obtained through basic and pre-clinical innovative research. Utilizing cutting-edge sequencing and imaging modality in our proposed study, we will have the capacity to systematically dissect traits of early metastatic behavior and discover potential novel therapeutic targets for paradigm-shifting novel adjuvant therapy tailored to specific target metastatic evolution. The conceptual validation from our bold and pioneering attempt proposed in this study will serves as a blueprint for a new category of adjuvant therapies for effective anti-metastasis treatment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful anti-metastasis treatment is rooted deep in our mechanistic understanding of early metastatic evolution and our capability to stop metastatic progression before aggressive outgrowth occurs. Using single cell transcriptome sequencing and multiplexed single cell deep-tissue imaging, we aim to trace and analyze the lineage dynamics of a single cancer cell within its specific metastatic microenvironment from the initial moment of metastatic colonization. The conceptual advances validated from this study will serve as a blueprint for future adjuvant therapies targeting early metastatic evolution, providing more effective cancer treatments.",(PQD-3) Spatiotemporal Molecular Interrogation of Early Metastatic Evolution In Situ,9292041,R01CA194697,"['post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' Aftercare ', ' Behavior ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' Evolution ', ' Exhibits ', ' Spillage ', ' Leakage ', ' Extravasation ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' Future ', ' Genotype ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Methods ', ' Biological Models ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Statistical Models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' mortality ', ' Neoplasm Metastasis ', ' tumor cell metastasis ', ' cancer metastasis ', ' Secondary Tumor ', ' Secondary Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Tumor ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Mass ', ' Metastatic Lesion ', ' Metastasize ', ' Metastasis ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' pressure ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Secondary to ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Metastatic Tumor to the Brain ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm to the Brain ', ' Brain Metastasis ', ' Metastatic malignant neoplasm to brain ', ' Failure ', ' insight ', ' Disease Progression ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Cell Structure ', ' Cell Components ', ' Cellular Structures ', ' Oncologist ', ' Metabolism Studies ', ' Metabolic Studies ', ' Abnormal Assessment of Metabolism ', ' metabolic abnormality assessment ', ' cancer cell ', ' Malignant Cell ', ' Disseminated Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Cancer ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' Distant ', ' In Situ ', ' neoplastic cell ', ' Tumor Cell ', ' success ', ' checkup examination ', ' checkup ', ' Check-up ', ' trait ', ' Adjuvant Therapy ', ' Primary Neoplasm ', ' Primary Tumor ', ' novel ', ' Categories ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' imaging modality ', ' imaging method ', ' image-based method ', ' Address ', ' Mammary Neoplasms ', ' mammary tumor ', ' Mammary Cancer ', ' Breast Tumors ', ' Breast Neoplasms ', ' Data ', ' in vivo ', ' survive cancer ', ' Cancer Survivor ', ' trial treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' data integration ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' pre-clinical research ', ' preclinical research ', ' therapeutic target ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' tumor ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' novel therapy target ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' novel pharmacotherapy target ', ' novel druggable target ', ' novel drug target ', ' new therapy target ', ' new pharmacotherapy target ', ' new druggable target ', ' new drug target ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical practice ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' screening ', ' intravital imaging ', ' intra-vital imaging ', ' 4D Imaging ', ' four-dimensional imaging ', ' 4-D imaging ', ' Algorithmic Analysis ', ' Analysis of Algorithms ', ' Analyses of Algorithms ', ' Algorithmic Analyses ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted therapy ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' glutamatergic signaling ', ' glutamatergic dendrodendritic synapses ', ' glutamate signaling ', ' transcriptome ', ' Tissue imaging ', ' imaging study ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME,R01,2017,347700,IN-02,0.07027368504531031
"Interpreting limits to nanoparticle delivery in high-stroma low-perfusion tumors 4.4.7 Project Summary/Abstract  The central theme in this work is that critical spatial patterns exist in highly resistant cancer stroma and vascular density that inherently inhibit larger nanoparticle penetration into cancer, and that these phenotypes can be imaged in vivo. We will use in vivo diagnostic imaging, combined with ex vivo analysis to test this in pancreatic cancer, which has as well known drug penetration limitation. Specifically, we will quantify nanoparticle penetration in pancreas cancer, which has high stroma content and low vascular density. The analysis and prediction of efficacy will be quantitatively developed by methodological correlation of in-vivo and ex vivo images using Fourier spatial frequency analysis.  We will determine the characteristic spatial patterns of these tumor microstructures that present as barriers to nanoparticle transport, as assayed through in vivo/ex vivo studies. We have seen that these characteristic spectral features appear in high-field magnetic resonance imaging (HF-MRI) scans and micro-Computed Tomography (uCT) scans of tumors imaged within the ongoing nanoparticle project at DHMC. The scope of this project is to conduct a secondary analysis on the images that are being produced within these projects, with two specific aims. 1) We will directly correlate nanoparticle penetration and distribution to the Fourier spatial frequencies found in in vivo images by Fourier spatial frequency analysis in which we have demonstrated expertise. The in vivo images will be analyzed by correlating them with histological sections of nanoparticle distribution post-treatment. Tumors will be classified on two levels as either a high or low permeability to a specific nanoparticle formulation (to quantify the amount of agent delivered), and as having high or low isotropy (to quantify the dispersion of the agent). 2) We will then apply this characteristic morphology analysis to pre-treatment, pre-operative HF-MRI, uCT images, and analyze their value as a potential diagnostic classifier. We will use a Support Vector Machine Analysis to predict the permeability and isotropy of unknown tumors, and validate our results against experimental outcomes. An iterative strategy will optimize the predictive power of the method, and be used to distinguish between characteristic spectra that are good and bad classifiers.  The research will be produced using the unique software systems that we have designed during preliminary studies, and will be deployed on an analysis platform that can be integrated with the hospital- based DICOM and virtual pathology environment to allow clinical investigators to plan adjuvant therapies to promote nanoparticle efficacy. Several hundred high-quality scans are now available for analysis, which will be processed and reported on within the first year of funding. By year two, the established system is projected to be able to analyze images within a few minutes post-scan. These analysis methods will give us the key background needed to advance our fundamental understanding of nanoparticle in-vivo delivery, and test ways to interrupt transport barriers in interventional future work. 4.4.8 Project Narrative The PI will apply a novel image analysis method to identify spatial patterns in images taken from in vivo experiments that indicate the presence of physical barriers to nanoparticle and liposomal transport in solid cancer tumor.

"Systems Microscopy Analysis of Tumor Cell Motility in Microenvironment Context DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Candidate: Majoring as analytical chemist during the time in Belgrade, Serbia, Dr. Gligorijevic has become an expert in optics and live cell microscopy over the course of her graduate training at Georgetown University and developed several novel microscopy-based technologies. During the postdoctoral period, Dr. Gligorijevic has focused on studying tumor cell intravasation in breast tumors, in living animals. To do so, she introduced several advancements into in vivo multiphoton microscopy. Dr. Gligorijevic is funded by DOD and Charles Revson Fellowship and has received several honors for her research. Her work to date resulted in one patent, ten peer-reviewed and ten other publications. Recent research has shown that different components of tumor microenvironment have an essential role in tumor progression. In order to decipher the network of interactions which shape the tumor environment and determine tumor cell behavior, it is ideal to apply systems biology approaches combined with in vivo microscopy, as cell cultures are limited in their complexity, mouse models are time-consuming and expensive and in silico models need optimization based on experiments. During the mentored phase of the Award, Dr. Gligorijevic will incorporate the relevant principles of advanced statistics and mathematical modeling of dynamical systems into her background of tumor biology and microscopy. She will take coursework offered at Einstein and meet regularly with her sponsor and co-sponsor. This training will make it possible to build a laboratory which investigates mechanisms of metastasis using the integrative, systems microscopy approach and utilizing information from molecular to population levels.  Environment: Sponsor of the PI, Dr. John Condeelis is a Co-Chair of Anatomy Department and Biophotonic Center at Einstein. His lab and the Center create a multidisciplinary environment focused on answering mechanisms of human diseases, such as cancer, through use of microscopy. The Center is well known for its shared imaging resources and Innovation Laboratory where new microscopy systems are custom-built to accommodate specific needs of different projects. Consulting member of Advisory Committee, Dr. Robert Singer, is an expert in combining experimental and theoretical biology and a renowned mentor. The co-sponsor, Dr. Aviv Bergman, is the Founding Chair of Systems Department at Einstein and teaches coursework which will be a part of the career development. Einstein is an institution which highly values collaboration and insists on career development of postdoctoral fellows, instructors and junior faculty.  Research: While most research of tumor microenvironments focuses on isolating and understanding single parameters, an integrative, systems-level network of interactions among relevant biological players is missing. In primary tumors, there are numerous biomechanical signals able to direct tumor cell movement towards and into the blood vessels. Growth factors, secreted by host macrophages, fibroblasts and endothelial cells in the tumor microenvironment are the main chemoattractants but recent studies show that the extracellular matrix also plays an important role. In loose extracellular matrix, tumor cells can migrate by reorganizing their cytoskeleton, generating a protrusive force. In regions with stiff extracellular matrix, simple locomotion is not possible. Here, tumor cells become invasive and degrade extracellular matrix, mainly by matrix metalloproteases (MMPs). Tumor cell migration was well characterized in vivo, but the mechanism of the switch from locomotory to invasive state and assembly of invasive protrusions in vivo are unknown. To address the link between integrated microenvironment signaling and the tumor cell behavior, it is necessary to combine cell biology, advanced microscopy and systems biology. In preliminary experiments, tumor cells were recorded using time-resolved 3D multiphoton imaging in living mice and two different protrusion types were observed: a) locomotory protrusions which quickly lead to migration of the tumor cell and b) invasive protrusions, which are persistent and MMP-dependent. The goal of Aim 1 is to investigate the role of invasive protrusions in the tumor cell intravasation and metastasis. A combination of fluorescent reporters will be used for imaging of invasive protrusion assembly and investigation of consequent tumor cell fate. Aim 2 explores signals which drive tumor cells to form either locomotory or invasive protrusions or to switch between behaviors. In areas which contain either locomotory or invasive protrusions, tumor microenvironment parameters are recorded simultaneously (number of macrophages, collagen stiffness, blood vessel size etc.). Imaging analysis results in a data matrix, which is analyzed by a Support Vector Machine classification. Classification shows that tumor cells switch from locomotory to invasive states under very specific conditions. Proposed experiments test the hypothesis that tumor cell behavior can be changed by slightly modifying microenvironment parameters. Relevant microenvironment parameters are incorporated into an integrative mathematical model of the tumor cell switch from locomotory to invasive state, in Aim 3. Using the predictive power of the model, experiments were designed to inhibit the invasive state and subsequent metastasis. Experimental outcomes will be used to optimize and complexify the model. Results of this study will lead to better understanding of the interplay among microenvironment components during tumor progression and the results will be used to improve diagnosis and treatment of early metastasis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project investigates the underlying mechanisms of tumor cell motility in the context of primary tumor microenvironment. Outcomes will reveal how host environment influences tumor cell entry into the blood vessels (intravasation). Findings will be applied towards new diagnostic and therapeutic markers for early metastasis in breast cancer.",Systems Microscopy Analysis of Tumor Cell Motility in Microenvironment

"Stimulated Raman imaging for label-free histology to guide brain tumor surgery ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of brain tumor surgery is to maximize removal of tumor without causing permanent neurologic deficits. Studies have shown that outcomes for patients depend strongly on these two variables. However, this is difficult because tumor tissue is often indistinguishable from healthy tissue in the operating room. Preoperative and intraoperative MRI through neuronavigation can be used to guide brain tumor surgery, but it is not able to accurately delineate the tumor margin due to the brain deformation and brain shift during surgery. H&E staining as the current gold standard is often performed intraoperatively for preliminary diagnosis, but it is not used to guide extent of resection routinely due to the limitations including tissue artifacts, labor-intensiveness, and time delay. Fluorescence guided surgery is beginning to be used to guided brain tumor surgery, but is generally not useful for low grade gliomas, the tumors which pose the greatest challenge and opportunity to extend survival and improve quality of life. Stimulated Raman imaging (SRI) has been used for rapid label-free biomolecular mapping in live tissue. Recently we have developed a novel approach with SRI to image nucleic acids, together with protein and lipids. Visualization of nucleic acids allows definition of nuclear morphology and chromatin structures, thereby enabling pathologic evaluation of clinically relevant cellular morphology, providing almost equivalent information to H&E staining. The goal of this translational research is to establish the methodology and practice for label-free histopathology with SRI for brain tumor diagnosis, and eventually develop it into a clinical device for ambient SR imaging of fresh tissue in the operating room in real time If the aims are achieved, this project will greatly improve the current clinical practice of brain tumor surgery by providing real time tissue diagnosis for more precise control of the extent of resection and preservation of neurologic function. Furthermore, this approach may be of value for all oncologic surgeries and other clinical pathology such as fine needle biopsies and bone marrow biopsy. The candidate for this award Dr. Fake Lu is a postdoctoral research fellow at Brigham and Women's Hospital. Dr. Lu has extensive experience and expertise in biophotonics and biomedical optics, specialized in system innovations of stimulated Raman microscopy and multiphoton microscopy for biomedical applications. BWH is an international leader in basic, clinical and translational research on human diseases, and has established multiple research programs to promote the work and professional career development of young investigators. BWH is also home to the National Center for Image Guided Therapy (P41) and the Advanced Multi-modality Image Guided operating suite (AMIGO) infrastructure which will greatly support to proposed research. Dr. Lu's long term research goal is to develop and apply advanced biophysical and optical technologies and devices to improve understanding, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases, such as cancers, for better health care. His long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator working at the frontier of translational research. The immediate objectives for the five-year award period is to 1) establish and evaluate label-free histopathology SRI for brain tumor diagnosis, 2) to demonstrate ambient imaging of surgically removed fresh tissue for diagnosis of brain tumors for real time guidance of neurosurgical resection, 3) to develop a novel stimulated Raman microscopy to collect full spectral data in parallel for label-free histopathology, as well as lipid biomarker screening, 4) t develop a computer algorithm for SR image analysis to realize automatic brain tumor diagnosis, and 5) finally by integrating the instrument and software to build and demonstrate a prototype of a clinical device for guiding neurosurgical resection of brain tumors. This device could also be used for other oncologic surgeries and will have great potential for commercialization. To conduct the proposed research, in addition to further develop his current strengths in biophotonics, stimulated Raman microscopy, and nonlinear optical microscopy, Dr. Lu plans to receive more education and training to enrich and expand his knowledge and expertise in the following four areas: 1) to receive critical training in conducting translational research, 2) to enrich his knowledge and deepen his understanding in brain tumor biology and medicine, 3) to learn skills in developing computer algorithms for SR image analysis, and 4) to prepare for writing grant applications and seeking funding independently. Dr. Lu will participate in 12 formal courses selected from those offered by Harvard Catalyst and Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. He will attend weekly seminars at BWH and Harvard University, seminar series on biomedical image analysis organized by MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. He will also attend one or two annual conferences per year to present his work for peer discussion. A strong mentoring team was organized to provide solid support to the proposed research and Dr. Lu's career development, including Dr. Alexandra Golby in neurosurgery at BWH, Prof. X. Sunney Xie in coherent Raman microscopy at Harvard, Prof. Nathalie Agar in molecular cancer diagnosis at BWH, Prof. Polina Golland in computer-based image analysis at MIT, and Dr. Sandro Santagata in neuropathology at BWH. This career development award will provide Dr. Lu with the training and skills needed to transition into an independent investigator in translational research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Surgery is the standard treatment for brain tumors, and the goal of brain tumor surgery is to completely remove the tumor without causing neurologic deficits. However, it is often difficult to distinguish normal and cancerous tissue during surgery. This project aims to develop a novel tool based on stimulated Raman microscopy to image fresh brain tissue in a label-free manner, providing comparable histological information to conventional H&E staining, to guide brain tumor resection in real time in the operating room.",Stimulated Raman imaging for label-free histology to guide brain tumor surgery,9531474,R00EB020749,"['Agar ', ' Algorithms

"Integrated Discovery Pipeline for Tumor Neoantigens Project Summary Cancer immunotherapy is now established as a major therapeutic modality. Significant progress with checkpoint inhibitor monoclonal antibodies demonstrates durable tumor regression in metastatic melanoma, lung cancer and other malignancies. One conspicuous limitation is the paucity of validated tumor antigens, which impedes clinical investigators in their pursuit of developing new cancer immunotherapies. Tumor encoded non-synonymous mutations may provide a new source of potential target antigens. T cells recognize tumor missense mutations as amino acid substituted peptides presented in the context of major histocompatibility molecules on the cancer cell surface, thus implicating missense mutations as a source of patient-specific neoantigens. We recently described the first-in-human study to use next generation sequencing technologies to identify and validate tumor missense mutations as neoantigens. Our study demonstrates that vaccination increases the breadth and diversity of neoantigen-specific T cells resulting in a broad repertoire of effector CD8+ T cells that uniquely discriminates mutated antigens from wild type peptides ensuring tumor specificity. This proposal aims to find a unique solution to the scarcity of tumor antigens by developing a neoantigen discovery pipeline that integrates genomic and proteomic technologies. In this proposal, a unique academic-industry partnership comprised of an established team of experts, in cancer genomics, cancer proteomics, human immunology, and clinical oncology, aim to solve the challenging problem of tumor neoantigen discovery. The long-term goal is to develop a robust pipeline using cutting-edge technologies merged with machine learning algorithms to supply tumor neoantigens for clinical investigation. The goal of this proposal will be addressed in the experiments of the following specific aims: 1) to identify the repertoire of melanoma expressed somatic mutations by next generation sequencing technologies; 2) to develop a novel proteomics platform to identify melanoma neoantigens presented by HLA class I molecules; 3) to validate neoantigen identification in a vaccination protocol. The proposed pipeline will deliver a transformative solution for tumor antigen identification, should be translatable to other “immune responsive“ malignancies and enable the nascent discipline of precision medicine to provide effective and safe immunotherapies for cancer patients. Project Narrative This project is relevant to public health as it aims to develop a neoantigen discovery pipeline to address the paucity of validated cancer antigens available for immunotherapy. The pipeline integrates two powerful and well-established technologies, genomics and proteomics. If successful, this pipeline will enable the delivery of precision immunotherapy in a clinically relevant timeframe for patients with melanoma as well as other malignancies.",Integrated Discovery Pipeline for Tumor Neoantigens,9349466,R01CA204261,"['Algorithms ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Alleles ', ' Clinical Treatment Moab ', ' Monoclonal Antibodies ', ' immunogen ', ' ATGN ', ' Antigens ', ' Immunological Surface Markers ', ' Immunologic Surface Markers ', ' Cell Surface Antigens ', ' Surface Antigens ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' cDNA ', ' Complementary DNA ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Clinical Investigator ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Fluorescence Polarization ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Tissue Compatibility ', ' Histocompatibility ', ' Major Histocompatibility Complex Class 1 ', ' MHC class I antigen ', ' MHC Class I Protein ', ' MHC Class I Molecule ', ' Complex Class 1 ', ' Class I Major Histocompatibility Antigens ', ' Class I Antigens ', ' Histocompatibility Antigens Class I ', ' Leukocyte Antigens ', ' Human Leukocyte Antigens ', ' HL-A Antigens ', ' HLA Antigens ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Immunity ', ' Immunotherapy ', ' immune therapy ', ' Immunologically Directed Therapy ', ' Incentives ', ' Institutes ', ' Laboratories ', ' melanoma ', ' Malignant Melanoma ', ' Methods ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Patients ', ' Peptides ', ' Privatization ', ' Public Health ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' T-Lymphocyte ', ' thymus derived lymphocyte ', ' Thymus-Dependent Lymphocytes ', ' T-Cells ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' tumor-specific antigen ', ' Tumor-Associated Antigen ', ' Tumor Antigens ', ' Universities ', ' Vaccination ', ' Vaccines ', ' Washington ', ' Immunology ', ' Immunologist ', ' human subject ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Series ', ' Ensure ', ' Discipline ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' T8 Lymphocytes ', ' T8 Cells ', ' CD8-Positive Lymphocytes ', ' CD8+ T-Lymphocyte ', ' CD8+ T cell ', ' CD8 lymphocyte ', ' CD8 T cells ', ' CD8 Cell ', ' CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes ', ' vaccine-based immunotherapy ', ' anticancer immunotherapy ', ' anti-cancer immunotherapy ', ' Immunochemotherapy ', ' Immuno-Chemotherapy ', ' cancer immunotherapy ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' oncology ', ' Metastatic Melanoma ', ' Therapeutic ', ' cancer cell ', ' Malignant Cell ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Immune ', ' Immunes ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Source ', ' Amino Acid Substitution ', ' Somatic Mutation ', ' mutant ', ' synthetic peptide ', ' Missense Mutation ', ' Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell ', ' PBMC ', ' Speed ', ' novel ', ' Modality ', ' Cell surface ', ' Reporting ', ' response ', ' Proteomics ', ' Genomics ', ' Binding ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Clinical Oncology ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Immune Targeting ', ' Mutate ', ' Antigen Targeting ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Tumor-Derived ', ' Validation ', ' Immunologically ', ' Immunological ', ' Immunologic ', ' Immunochemical Immunologic ', ' Immunologics ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' oncogenomics ', ' cancer genomics ', ' tumor genome ', ' cancer cell genome ', ' cancer genome ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' immunogenicity ', ' next generation ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' human study ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' cancer proteomics ', ' tumor ', ' tumor specificity ', ' industry partner ', ' industry partnership ', ' industrial partnership ', ' candidate selection ', ' T cell response ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' nextgen sequencing ', ' next gen sequencing ', ' NGS system ', ' NGS Method ', ' exome sequencing ', ' screening ', ' precision medicine ', ' clinical investigation ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Immune checkpoint inhibitor ', ' Checkpoint inhibitor ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2017,542768,PA-03,0.117552002980168
"Proteogenomic Data Analysis for Cancer Systems Biology and Clinical Translation PROJECT SUMMARY It has become feasible to generate deep quantitative data for many of the molecules that are functional in cells, making it possible to survey a large number of tumors measuring genomic alterations and changes to transcripts, proteins and metabolites. It is, however, not clear what is the best way to integrate these data sets to extract as much information as possible about the biology that drives the cancer and how to best disrupt the tumor growth. Our proposed Proteogenomic Data Analysis Center for Cancer Systems Biology and Clinical Translation will develop new methods for better analyzing and integrating these data sets. In addition to developing statistical and machine learning methods, we also emphasize visual exploration of the data, and we will implement interactive web browser based visualization that will allow researchers to easily explore these vast data sets and gain novel insights by being able to quickly switch between summary information and details of the raw data. PROJECT NARRATIVE The mission of the proposed data analysis center is to leverage high dimensional large-scale data from tumor samples to identify new avenues for the development of clinical prognostics and therapeutics for cancer. This mission will be realized through analysis, integration and visualization of multi-omic datasets including genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data collected from patient samples to develop predictive models, and during drug treatment of patient derived xenografts and cell lines to validate mechanisms.",Proteogenomic Data Analysis for Cancer Systems Biology and Clinical Translation,9353354,U24CA210972,"['aminoacid ', ' Amino Acids ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Architecture ', ' Biology ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Communities ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Sources ', ' drug treatment ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Libraries ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Neoplasm Metastasis ', ' tumor cell metastasis ', ' cancer metastasis ', ' Secondary Tumor ', ' Secondary Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Tumor ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Mass ', ' Metastatic Lesion ', ' Metastasize ', ' Metastasis ', ' Patients ', ' Peptides ', ' Phenotype ', ' Phosphoproteins ', ' Phosphorylation ', ' Protein Phosphorylation ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prognosis ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' protein kinase inhibitor ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Template Activating Factor I Beta ', ' SET Translocation Inhibitor-2 of Protein Phosphatase-2A ', ' Phosphatase 2A Inhibitor I2PP2A ', ' Inhibitor of GZMA-Activated DNase ', ' IGAAD ', ' HLA-DR Associated Protein II ', ' Set protein ', ' Visualization ', ' Imagery ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' prognostic ', ' insight ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Measurement ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' Collaborations ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Consensus ', ' Knowledge ', ' Pattern ', ' Xenograft procedure ', ' xeno-transplantation ', ' xeno-transplant ', ' Xenotransplantation ', ' Xenograft ', ' Heterologous Transplantation ', ' Heterograft ', ' Quantitative Trait Loci ', ' QTL ', ' tumor growth ', ' cohort ', ' trait ', ' Primary Neoplasm ', ' Primary Tumor ', ' novel ', ' Gene Proteins ', ' Protein Gene Products ', ' Proteome ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' assay development ', ' Proteomics ', ' Genomics ', ' Amino Acid Sequence Databases ', ' Protein Sequence Databases ', ' computerized data processing ', ' data processing ', ' Protein Kinase Inhibitors ', ' Systems Biology ', ' DNA Sequence Alteration ', ' genomic alteration ', ' Sequence Alteration ', ' Genetic mutation ', ' DNA mutation ', ' DNA Alteration ', ' Data ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Gene Family ', ' Transcript ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' protein metabolite ', ' clinical phenotype ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' transcriptomics ', ' tool development ', ' tumor ', ' candidate marker ', ' candidate biomarker ', ' candidate identification ', ' Knowledge Discovery ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision oncology ', ' precision cancer medicine ', ' personalized oncology ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' Data Analytics ', ' transcriptome ', ' Formulation ', ' protein biomarkers ', ' protein markers ', ' proteogenomics ', ' treatment choice ', ' actionable mutation ', ' driver mutation ', ' genomic data ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' clinical translation ', ' clinical development ', ' high dimensionality ', ' ']",NCI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,U24,2017,624613,NY-12,0.09650324813314672
"Characterization of the functions of one-carbon metabolism across human cancers Project Summary/Abstract Cancerous cells reprogram their metabolism to accommodate their needs. A deep understanding of this metabolic reprograming can lead to novel and promising routes toward cancer treatment. Different human cancers differ with respect to aspects of their metabolic rewiring, however a profound knowledge in this field is lacking. The main goal of my thesis project is to characterize the ways in which one-carbon metabolism — a metabolic pathway highly altered in cancer— is utilized by different human cancers and elucidate its consequences on downstream processes such as epigenetics and biosynthesis. Using information in genomic profiles of individual tumors, I build computational models to infer metabolic landscapes, assess their implications in patient survival, and predict response to chemotherapy. By studying one-carbon metabolites in the human serum, I confirm the relevance of theses findings in human contexts and suggest potentials for dietary intervention approaches. In aim 1, I characterize the usage of serine through one-carbon metabolism across human cancers. I performed flux analysis using gene expression profiles of hundreds of human tumors, followed by experimental validation using metabolomics approaches. In aim 2, I identify the determinants of human serum methionine. Diet records, serum metabolomics, and clinical data from a cohort of human subjects were incorporated into computational models. The determinants of variability in serum methionine were then quantified, suggesting a mechanism for regulation of cellular epigenetics by the diet. In aim 3, I determine the sources of variation in DNA methylation across human cancers and the contribution of metabolism. I integrated molecular and clinical profiles of thousands of human tumors from the TCGA into machine-learning algorithms to identify their association with DNA methylation. A major contribution from one-carbon metabolism in regulating DNA methylation status in tumors was found. In aim 4, I predict response to anti-metabolic chemotherapies based on tumor genomics. I plan to translate my previous findings into clinical discoveries. To this end, I will demonstrate how tumor profiles can be used to model patient survival, predict response to chemotherapy, and move toward precision medicine. Narrative Alteration in cellular metabolism is one the hallmarks of cancer. This project aims to elucidate the consequences of these alterations in cancer and reveal how different human cancers differ with respect to their metabolism. Findings can lead to novel and promising routes toward cancer prevention and treatment such as precision medicine and dietary intervention.",Characterization of the functions of one-carbon metabolism across human cancers,9410769,K00CA212457,"['Algorithms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Carbon ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Food Diaries ', ' Dietary Records ', ' Diet Records ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Enzymes ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Fluouracil ', ' Fluoruracil ', ' Fluoro Uracil ', ' 5FU ', ' 5-Fluracil ', ' 5-FU ', ' Fluorouracil ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Aminoacetic Acid ', ' Glycine ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Methionine ', ' Methotrexate ', ' Metotrexato ', ' Methotrexatum ', ' Methotrexate Methylaminopterin ', ' Patients ', ' Serine ', ' L-Serine ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Translating ', ' base ', ' human subject ', ' Label ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' Multitargeted Antifolate ', ' Pemetrexed ', ' biosynthesis ', ' Anabolism ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Serum ', ' Individual ', ' Metabolic Networks ', ' Biochemical Pathway ', ' diet intervention ', ' Nutritional Interventions ', ' Nutrition Interventions ', ' Dietary Intervention ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Metabolic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Knowledge ', ' Source ', ' Route ', ' Pattern ', ' Somatic Mutation ', ' cell growth regulation ', ' Cellular Regulation ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' chemotherapeutic agent ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Genomics ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Metabolic Pathway ', ' metabolomics ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' Copy Number Polymorphism ', ' copy number variation ', ' copy number variant ', ' DNA Methylation Regulation ', ' Dietary Component ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' molecular signature ', ' molecular profile ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' Subgroup ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' genomic region ', ' Genomic Segment ', ' Validation ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' epigenomics ', ' Outcome ', ' Cancer cell line ', ' cancer type ', ' Cancerous ', ' experimental analysis ', ' chemotherapy ', ' tumor ', ' The Cancer Genome Atlas ', ' TCGA ', ' precision medicine ', ' epigenetic regulation ', ' predicting response ', ' response prediction ', ' predictor of response ', ' predictive response ', ' genomic profiles ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' genomic predictors ', ' ']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K00,2017,71064,CA-18,0.07523869579984434
"Quantifying Multiscale Competitive Landscapes of Clonal Diversity in Glioblastoma ABSTRACT  Glioblastoma (GBM) exhibits profound intratumoral molecular heterogeneity that contributes to treatment resistance and poor survival. Specifically, each tumor comprises multiple molecularly-distinct subpopulations with different treatment sensitivities. This heterogeneity not only portends the pre-existence of resistant molecular subpopulations, but also the communications between neighboring subpopulations that further modulate tumorigenicity and resistance. In fact, a minority tumor subpopulation with EGFRvIII mutation has been shown to potentiate a majority subpopulation with wild-type EGFR to increase tumor growth, cell survival, and drug resistance. This type of cooperativity presents clear implications for improving GBM treatment. Yet compared to other tumor types, the interactions in GBM remain critically understudied. A significant barrier to studying the interactions between molecularly-distinct subpopulations is the challenge of tissue sampling in GBM. In particular, contrast-enhanced MRI (CE-MRI) routinely guides surgical biopsy and resection of the MRI enhancing core, but fails to address the diverse subpopulations of the surrounding non-enhancing parenchyma (so called “brain around tumor” or BAT). These unresected residual subpopulations in BAT represent the main contributors to tumor recurrence, which can exhibit different therapeutic targets (and interactions) compared with enhancing biopsies. To address the limitations of tissue sampling, imaging techniques can help quantitatively characterize tumors in their entirety, including unresected BAT regions. Our group has used multi-parametric MRI and image-guided biopsies to develop and validate machine-learning (ML) models of intratumoral genomic heterogeneity, with particular focus on the BAT zone. In Aim 1, will we collect and molecularly profile a large set of image-recorded stereotactic biopsies in primary GBM patients to quantify the diversity of molecularly-distinct subpopulations, as well as their phenotypic niches, throughout the BAT zone. We will assess local heterogeneity at the biopsy level and also co-localize regional patterns and rates of recurrence on serial MRI. In Aim 2, we will use these biopsies and spatially matched MRI metrics to refine our existing ML predictive models. We will use these ML models to co- localize spatial patterns of molecularly-distinct subpopulations (and their phenotypic niches) to quantify their risk of regional recurrence. In Aim 3, we will functionally validate the subpopulation interactions observed in Aims 1 and 2 using patient derived xenograft (PDX) models. We will also validate these interactions in human GBM using a subset of spatially matched biopsies from primary and recurrent tumors in the same patients. This proposal leverages our unique expertise in image-guided tissue analysis and MRI-based computational modeling to study the diversity of molecularly-distinct subpopulations and the evolving competitive landscapes in human GBM. This work will help risk stratify patients in future targeted clinical drug trials and should also facilitate new strategies (e.g., adaptive therapy) to exploit subpopulation co-dependency for therapeutic benefit. PROJECT NARRATIVE  We propose here a novel strategy that identifies the potential molecular underpinnings of treatment resistance within the zone where tumor almost always recurs. By developing image-based models that quantify the diversity of molecularly-distinct subpopulations (and their interactions) within individual tumors, the proposed work will improve image-based diagnosis and therapeutic strategies in the paradigm of individualized oncology.",Quantifying Multiscale Competitive Landscapes of Clonal Diversity in Glioblastoma,9389124,U01CA220378,"['Behavior ', '

"Exploring the Role of Mitochondrial Fission in Pancreatic Tumorigenesis Project Summary A wealth of data over the past few years, from our lab and others, has demonstrated that the mitochondrial morphology of tumor cells is distinct from normal cells. Furthermore, a number of studies have shown that genetic or pharmacological manipulation of the machinery that regulates mitochondrial morphology can impact a variety of tumorigenic processes. Indeed, in work performed for the parent grant of this proposal, we have shown that genetic inhibition of the mitochondrial fission GTPase Drp1 can block pancreatic tumor growth and increase survival in a genetically engineered mouse model. This work has led to the deeper question of how changes in mitochondrial shape, which ultimately result from a combination of both genetic and environmental influences, contribute to the physiological processes that drive tumor growth. This question has been difficult to ask using traditional genetic and pharmacological approaches due to the complexity of the signaling pathways that converge on the mitochondria and the inherent heterogeneity present within the tumor and its surrounding stroma. To that end, we have developed a new software package designed to catalogue the morphological features of mitochondria within cells in culture or in fixed tissue. By using this software to analyze the tumor cells developed in our mouse models of pancreatic cancer, we propose to determine the relationship between specific mitochondrial features and key physiological attributes of these tumors. To do this, we have developed a machine learning technique, validated against a panel of tumor derived pancreatic cell lines with genetically-induced mitochondrial heterogeneity, capable of identifying relationships between mitochondrial features, or combinations of mitochondrial features, and other attributes of those cells. This approach will allow us to leverage the wealth of phenotypic data we have collected from our tumors with the data we are now able to collect on the mitochondrial heterogeneity, either between or within those tumors, in order to identify the role that mitochondrial heterogeneity plays in tumor growth, regardless of whether that heterogeneity arises from manipulation of the mitochondrial dynamics machinery or whether it arises from the myriad influences within the tumor environment. Successful completion of these aims will provide critical insights into the role that mitochondrial heterogeneity plays in pancreatic tumor growth and also pave the way for future analysis of mitochondrial heterogeneity in other tumor types. Project Narrative Our work exploring the role of Drp1-dependent mitochondrial fission in pancreatic tumor growth, using two relevant mouse models, has revealed that genetic inhibition of Drp1 can inhibit tumor growth and extend survival. In addition, these models provide a wealth of data to more deeply explore the relationship between mitochondrial heterogeneity and tumor physiology. We have developed robust computational methodology with which to explore this relationship. This exciting novel approach will provide critical insight into pancreatic tumorigenesis and potentially uncover novel therapeutic approaches.",Exploring the Role of Mitochondrial Fission in Pancreatic Tumorigenesis,9384887,R01CA200755,"['phenotypic data ', ' Algorithms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Future ', ' guanosinetriphosphatase ', ' Guanosinetriphosphatases ', ' GTPases ', ' GTP Phosphohydrolases ', ' Guanosine Triphosphate Phosphohydrolases ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Laboratories ', ' Methods ', ' Mitochondria ', ' mitochondrial ', ' Biological Models ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Mus ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' pancreatic neoplasm ', ' pancreatic neoplasia ', ' Pancreatic Tumor ', ' Pancreas Tumor ', ' Pancreas Neoplasms ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physiology ', ' Physiological Processes ', ' Physiologic Processes ', ' Organismal Process ', ' Organism-Level Process ', ' Play ', ' Proteins ', ' Reagent ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Employee Strikes ', ' Strikes ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Work ', ' oncosuppressor gene ', ' Tumor Suppressing Genes ', ' Recessive Oncogenes ', ' Oncogenes-Tumor Suppressors ', ' Onco-Suppressor Genes ', ' Emerogenes ', ' Cancer Suppressor Genes ', ' Antioncogenes ', ' Anti-Oncogenes ', ' Tumor Suppressor Genes ', ' Measures ', ' Tumor Cell Line ', ' Programmed Cell Death ', ' Apoptosis Pathway ', ' Apoptosis ', ' base ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' insight ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Letters ', ' Metabolic ', ' Genetic ', ' Morphology ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Malignant neoplasm of pancreas ', ' Pancreatic Cancer ', ' Pancreas Cancer ', ' Malignant Pancreatic Neoplasm ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Catalogs ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' Tumor Tissue ', ' Xenograft procedure ', ' xeno-transplantation ', ' xeno-transplant ', ' Xenotransplantation ', ' Xenograft ', ' Heterologous Transplantation ', ' Heterograft ', ' neoplastic cell ', ' Tumor Cell ', ' tumor growth ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' Normal Cell ', ' metabolomics ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma ', ' Pancreas Ductal Adenocarcinoma ', ' Data ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' molecular signature ', ' molecular profile ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' Tumor-Derived ', ' Tumor Biology ', ' Tumorigenicity ', ' Xenograft Model ', ' Characteristics ', ' GEM model ', ' Genetically Engineered Mouse ', ' Process ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' tumorigenic ', ' Population ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' Oncogenic ', ' user-friendly ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new drugs ', ' new drug treatments ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' tumor ', ' pancreatic tumorigenesis ', ' parent grant ', ' combat ', ' novel therapeutic intervention ', ' novel therapy approach ', ' novel therapeutic approach ', ' new therapy approaches ', ' new therapeutic strategies ', ' new therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic approach ', ' pancreatic cell line ', ' tumor heterogeneity ', ' intratumor heterogeneity ', ' intra-tumoral heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneity in tumors ', ' Intratumoral heterogeneity ', ' Inter-tumoral heterogeneity ', ' intertumoral heterogeneity ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2017,191853,VA-05,0.20494698034406814
"Accelerating Cancer Genomics with Cloud-scale Bioconductor PROJECT SUMMARY  The Bioconductor project is rooted in recognition that efﬁcient, rigorous, and reproducible analysis of high- dimensional data can be achieved when statisticians, biologists, and computer scientists federate efforts in a transparent and carefully engineered way. The project Accelerating Cancer Genomics with Cloud-scale Bio- conductor devises new approaches to carrying out genome-scale analysis of cancer data using cloud computing environments. The proposal is based on strategies that have proven highly effective in ﬁfteen years of supporting collaborative and carefully engineered software for genome scale analysis in computational biology in the Biocon- ductor project, based on the highly portable and widely adopted R language and environment for data analysis. In Aim 1 we develop architecture and infrastructure for scalably harvesting cloud-based representations of large- scale cancer genome studies such as The Cancer Genome Atlas, creating formal high-performance workﬂows for processing and interpreting cancer genome analyses, and providing packaging and data distribution schemes for moving data to the cloud for scalable analysis there. In Aim 2 we create and support independent creation of intuitive and cancer-relevant interface components supporting reproducible interactive exploration and analysis using the facilities of Rstudio. In Aim 3 we update and generalize the Bioconductor MLInterfaces metapackage to support advanced machine learning using the cancer-oriented strategies and facilities devised in Aims 1 and 2. Our proposal will beneﬁt large numbers of cancer researchers who will be taking advantage of cloud resources, probably with R close to hand, by marrying strengths of cloud-centric strategies for data archiving and query resolution, to the strengths of Bioconductor development and analysis capabilities. We have letters of support from the leadership of the three NCI Cancer Cloud Pilot projects for this project. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Despite major advances in elucidating mechanisms of tumor initiation and proliferation, treatment strategies for many cancers are ineffective, and patient-to-patient variation in treatment response suggests that personal targeting of cancer based on tumor molecular proﬁles will be necessary.

"Biomarkers for Staging and Treatment Response Monitoring of Bladder Cancer DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Bladder cancer is a common type of cancer that can cause substantial morbidity and mortality among both men and women. Bladder cancer causes over 15,210 deaths per year in the United States. It is estimated that 72,570 new bladder cancer cases will be diagnosed in 2013. Correct staging of the bladder cancer is crucial for the decision of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and minimizing the risk of under-treatment or over-treatment. A reliable assessment of the response to neoadjuvant therapy at an early stage is vital for identifying tumors that do not respond and allowing the patient a chance of alternative treatment. MRI and CT are important methods for pre-treatment staging or treatment response monitoring for a variety of bladder cancers. CT is an effective non-invasive modality for measuring primary site gross tumor volume (GTV) and the addition of MRI is on the rise. GTV has been used as a biomarker for predicting treatment outcome of bladder tumors. Other pathological information and diagnostic test (bimanual evaluation, cystoscopy) results and immunohistochemical biomarkers are also useful for staging and treatment response monitoring. The goal of this project is to develop effective decision support tools that merge image-based and non-image-based biomarkers to assist radiologists and oncologists in assessment of cancer stage and change as a result of treatment. We will (1) develop a quantitative image analysis tool (QIBC) for bladder GTV estimation on multi-modality (MM) images, (2) develop a computer decision support system (CDSS-S) to assist clinicians in cancer staging, (3) develop a computer decision support system (CDSS-T) to assist clinicians in evaluation of the change in the tumor characteristics as a result of neoadjuvant treatment, (4) evaluate the effects of QIBC and CDSS-T on inter-clinician variability and efficiency in estimation of GTV and treatment response, and (5) evaluate CDSS-S and CDSS-T as decision support tools in pilot clinical studies. We hypothesize that the use of QIBC, CDSS-S and CDSS-T can improve the clinicians' accuracy, consistency and efficiency in bladder GTV estimation on MM imaging exams, the assessment of bladder cancer stage and response to treatment. To test our hypothesis, we will perform the following specific tasks: (1) to collect a database of multi-modality MR, CT exams of bladder cancers for development, training and testing of the QIBC and CDSS algorithms; (2) to develop advanced computer vision techniques to quantitatively estimate bladder GTV and image characteristics; (3) to develop predictive models using machine learning techniques to combine MM image-based, pathological and immunohistochemical biomarkers for cancer staging and determination of non-responders; (4) to compare the inter-clinician variability and efficiency in clinicians' estimation of GTV and treatment response with and without the proposed QIBC and CDSS-T by observer studies; and (5) to evaluate the CDSS-S and CDSS-T as decision support tools in pilot clinical studies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: If successfully developed, the CDSS-S and CDSS-T can serve as non-invasive, objective, and reproducible clinical decision support systems for cancer staging and treatment response monitoring. Correct staging of the bladder cancer is crucial for the decision of chemotherapy treatment and minimizing the risk of under-treatment or over-treatment. If the response to chemotherapy can be estimated accurately it is possible to identify those patients that do not respond, stop the treatment early, and seek alternative treatment. In addition, although we will focus on the specific application to the bladder tumors in this proposed project, we will design the decision support tools in a modular, expandable, and re-trainable framework. The software package will be versatile and is adaptable to other tumor types or imaging modalities in the future by proper retraining with case samples of the tumor type of interest and expansion of the decision support tools as needed. Therefore, the development of the CDSS-S and CDSS-T will potentially benefit not only the bladder tumor patients but also patients with other tumor types that require staging and monitoring of treatment response.",Biomarkers for Staging and Treatment Response Monitoring of Bladder Cancer,9256441,U01CA179106,"['post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' Aftercare ', ' Algorithms ', ' urinary bladder ', ' Bladder Urinary System ', ' Bladder ', ' Urinary Bladder Malignant Tumor ', ' Urinary Bladder Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Bladder ', ' Malignant Bladder Neoplasm ', ' Bladder Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder ', ' Urinary Bladder Tumor ', ' Urinary Bladder Neoplasm ', ' Bladder Tumors ', ' Bladder Neoplasm ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' in situ cancer ', ' Preinvasive Carcinoma ', ' Intraepithelial Carcinoma ', ' Carcinoma in Situ ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' computer vision ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' Computers ', ' Cystoscopy ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' indexing ', ' Interobserver Variability ', ' Interobserver Variations ', ' Inter-Observer Variation ', ' Inter-Observer Variability ', ' Libraries ', ' Mass in breast ', ' breast mass ', ' Breast Nodule ', ' Breast Lump ', ' Follicular Lymphoma ', ' Nodular Lymphoma ', ' Giant Follicular Lymphoma ', "" Follicular Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma "", ' Follicle Center Lymphoma ', ' Brill-Symmers Disease ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Minor ', ' Morbidity -

"Topology of Cancer Evolution and Heterogeneity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In solid tumors, current limitations in our ability to identify the cell(s) of origin, track the dynamics of tumor subclonal architecture over space and time, and predict drug sensitivities in a mechanistic fashion pose significant challenges to our ability to develop effective treatments and undermine the utility of available therapies, particularly in tumors that become resistant. In this proposal, we argue that approaches based in mathematics and physics are well suited for addressing these critical problems. Historically, the physical sciences have been successful in solving fundamental scientific problems by producing reductionist models that enable the development of conceptual premises, technological breakthroughs that enable new kinds of measurements, and mathematical tools that can accurately represent and predict future activity. In this new Columbia University Physical Sciences-Oncology Center for Topology of Cancer Evolution and Heterogeneity (CUPS-OC), our goal is to develop, validate, and deliver a set of complementary mathematical, technological, and computational approaches that will provide the cancer research community with a framework for unraveling complexity in solid tumors, with the long-term aim of improving diagnosis and treatment. More specifically, the Center's primary research focus will be to study evolution and heterogeneity of solid tumors at the single cell level, by developing lineage tracing techniques in organoid and in vivo systems, single cell sequencing in primary tumors, and emerging genomics-based approaches for identifying targeted therapies. These experimental approaches will be supported by the development of novel, robust, and effective mathematical and computational approaches based in the field of topology, which offers unique and powerful methods for addressing the essential challenge of interpreting the high-dimensional data sets that state-of-the- art genomics technologies generate. In addition, we will promote the integration of physical science approaches into cancer research by both training new researchers and engaging established researchers working at the intersection of the physical sciences and cancer biology. Each of the projects and cores will address technical, mathematical, and biological challenges, contributing to the global enterprise of cancer research and to the development of a broader network of interdisciplinary researchers committed to advancing the field. If successful, we will be able to provide the scientific community with experimentally validated geometric and topological structures of causal inference of clonal evolution, single cell genomic protocols for fast and reliable uncovering of clonal heterogeneity, experimentally validated machine learning approaches for predicting drug sensitivities, and a strong multi-institutional, interdisciplinary program that creates bridges between researchers in pure mathematics, the technology sector, and cancer research.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cancer heterogeneity has been postulated as a major evolutionary force behind drug resistance.

"Towards the automation of MR spectroscopic imaging in patients with glioblashoma Glioblastoma is the most common adult primary brain tumor and is highly aggressive in its disease course. Despite advances in neurosurgical resection, radiation targeting, and chemotherapy, the prognosis remains grim with a median survival of just 15 months. The effectiveness of current radiation therapy strategies is severely limited by shortcomings in the imaging modalities used to develop treatment plans. Current radiation therapy planning is mainly based on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI, which identifies high grade tumors that are immediately associated with leaky neovasculature. Although it is an excellent diagnostic tool to identify high grade from low grade tumors, it is unable to signal occult infiltration beyond the core of the tumor. Though many believe GBM to be an incurable disease, we believe we have identified a method for optimizing tumor targeting that will increase the effectiveness of radiation therapy. A significant component of the current problem in GBM therapy is the lack of treatment for non-enhancing regions that are significantly infiltrated by neoplastic glioma cells without neovascularization. This untreated population undoubtedly leads to early recurrence. The proposed study addresses an important step toward translating an advanced quantitative imaging modality that complements the conventional imaging that is capable of reliably revealing glioma- infiltrated regions for precise, personalized treatment targeting. Proton spectroscopic magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) is an alternative modality able to identify endogenous metabolism within tissue without the need for exogenous contrast, and has been shown to identify the metabolic abnormalities associated with tumor beyond the regions identified by T1-weighted MRI. The clinical integration of sMRI in patient management has been limited due to the computational challenges of analysis of sMRI data. Two key hurdles to be overcome are the insufficiency of filters to remove image artifacts and the necessity of quantification of metabolic levels relative to a patient's baseline metabolism. As a result, sMRI processing requires skilled user intervention and many hours of computational and user time. To automate this pipeline and provide clinically useful information to oncologists, we seek to develop a software framework for the automated and expedient processing of sMRI for use in radiation therapy planning. We will use novel advances in the fields of high performance computing and deep learning, an approach to computation that has shattered benchmarks in many medical and non-medical problems. Specifically, we will develop filters for removing artifacts, algorithms for personalized diagnosis of tumor infiltration, and explore deep learning as a method to synthesize sMRI data with anatomical and clinical metrics in a fully automated fashion. Success in the proposed work will produce a “scanner-to-clinician” platform for quantitative, expedient, and objective analysis methods to integrate sMRI into the clinical radiation therapy planning paradigm. Ultimately, we believe this additional modality in the physician's tool belt will lead to better outcomes in patients suffering from this debilitating disease. Project Narrative  Proton spectroscopic magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) is a molecular imaging modality that can accurately detect abnormalities in the metabolic signatures of tumor cells, making it ideal for the detection and monitoring of highly infiltrative brain tumors like glioblastoma. Clinical adoption of sMRI has been slow due to limited tools for expedient and objective processing of sMRI data into information that oncologists can use for therapy planning. This proposal addresses these challenges using recent advances in high performance computing and machine learning to develop a software framework for using sMRI in the clinical management of patients with glioblastoma.",Towards the automation of MR spectroscopic imaging in patients with glioblashoma,9312109,F30CA206291,"['Adoption ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', '

"Quantitative Multimodal Image Guidance for Improved Liver Cancer Treatment Project Summary/Abstract  Liver cancer is the second most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide and is likely to grow even more in the next decade given the epidemic levels of hepatitis B and C and the emergence of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) due to obesity in the US. Most liver cancer patients present with disease that cannot be treated surgically. Minimally invasive, catheter-based, intra-arterial therapies such as TACE (transarterial chemoembolization) have become the mainstay therapy and are included in all treatment guidelines because of their ability to achieve local tumor control and extend survival. TACE overcomes the problem of chemoresistance in cancer cells by delivering high dose chemotherapy through image guidance and embolization of the tumor feeding blood vessel. TACE most commonly uses an oily medium (Lipiodol) as a radiopaque drug delivery mate- rial by creating an emulsion between drugs and oil. The recent introduction of drug-eluting bead (DEB) technol- ogy provides an opportunity to achieve the goal of controlled and sustainable drug release to tumors, which was not possible with oily TACE. Although TACE clearly improves patient survival, limitations still exist – speciﬁcally, incomplete treatment and tumor recurrence – attributed to the stimulation of angiogenesis. Most of these issues can be addressed with a greater understanding of the tumor microenvironment, in particular the relationship that exists between hypoxia, acidosis and angiogenesis. In fact, the development of imaging biomarkers reﬂecting changes within the tumor microenvironment is increasingly being pursued to individualize cancer therapies and increase their potency. Yet, our ability to characterize the tumor microenvironment using current imaging tech- nology is extremely limited. TACE has had to rely on 2D X-ray angiography until recently when the emergence of intra-procedural dual phase cone beam CT (DP-CBCT) contributed signiﬁcantly to improving tumor visualization, microcatheter guidance, and treatment endpoint. It is precisely through the longstanding close partnership be- tween Philips, Johns Hopkins and now Yale that this technology was optimized and became broadly accepted as the new standard of practice for TACE, demonstrating the prompt successful translation of research ﬁndings to clinical practice. However, the targeting of tumors and assessment of outcomes continues to be limited, relying on qualitative/semi-quantitative enhancement patterns from DP-CBCT and single parameter MR images. The unique partnership between Yale & Philips provides innovative technology that will directly enhance the role of image-guided intervention and address this unmet need by quantitatively characterizing the tumor microenvi- ronment and tumor tissue composition in order to maximize treatment potency and improve outcomes. We will integrate advanced, multiparameter MR with active CBCT imaging and create valuable biomarkers derived from novel machine learning methods for image and data analysis. By providing essential, quantitative information, drug delivery to tumors can be maximized because it will be based on inherent tumor properties. In the same way, the assessment of therapy will be much more precise and therefore useful to identify responders. Project Narrative This grant is aimed at enhancing our ability to deliver minimally invasive catheter-based treatments for liver cancer using drug delivery platforms which simultaneously embolize the tumor vasculature and locally deliver chemotherapy agents, and assess their efﬁcacy. At the core of the effort is the development, evaluation and translation to clinical practice of advanced imaging and analysis methods to characterize the tumor microen- vironment and derive feature information from novel multiparameter, multimodal images to classify tissue and quantify the response to therapy. The resulting methodology will lead to improved patient care through more precise delivery and more accurate response assessment.",Quantitative Multimodal Image Guidance for Improved Liver Cancer

"Targeting Tumors with NF1 Loss ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Genomic information can allow investigators to devise precision therapies that target molecular lesions specific to a patient's cancer. One of the molecular lesions present in many malignant tumors is loss of the NF1 tumor suppressor, which is a driver in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), one of the most frequently inherited genetic disorders. NF1 exhibits a broad clinical spectrum including benign nervous system tumors called neurofibromas, low-grade astrocytomas, pheochromocytoma, and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. Plexiform neurofibromas (PN) occur in deep nerves and can degenerate into malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), chemo- and radiation-resistant sarcomas with a dismal 20% five-year survival rate. In NF1 carriers, the lifetime risk is 30% for PN and 8-15% for MPNST. NF1 mutations are also found in sporadic tumors including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), melanoma, pheochromocytoma, ovarian, uterine, and lung cancers. Furthermore, in animal models and human tumor lines NF1 loss has been shown to drive GBM. A targeted molecular therapy designed to inhibit tumor-initiating and -promoting cells would substantially advance our ability to treat tumors that develop as a result of NF1 loss. Using complementary screening platforms, we identified small molecules that selectively killed or stopped the growth of cells carrying a mutation in NF1 as well as their molecular targets. In this application we focus on our top small molecule leads and the power of our model systems to test the hypothesis that aggressive neurological cancers that are known to be driven by NF1 loss and for which no cure exists, including PN, MPNST and GBM, will respond to molecules that we identified as synthetic lethal with NF1 loss. For this, we will determine pharmacokinetic properties of our top small molecule leads and, where needed, conduct structure-activity relationship studies to improve kinetics and/or reduce toxicity in order to test their efficacy in pre-clinical models of PN and GBM. We will leverage our model systems to define the mechanisms of action of our small molecule leads and add to our pipeline drugs in clinical trials that share the same targets. In addition to mutational inactivation, some GBM tumors exhibit down-regulation of the NF1 protein. Our lead compounds also stopped the growth of human GBM and neuroblastoma cells with low NF1 protein in vitro, supporting the broad application of the small molecule leads that we have identified. To capture tumors that have lost NF1 by any mechanism, we constructed an RNA-based classifier, which is capable of identifying downstream transcriptomic effects that indicate NF1 inactivation in GBM, using machine learning. We will apply the RNA-based classifier, along with targeted sequencing of NF1, to identify additional patient derived xenograft (PDX) GBM tumors that have an inactivating mutation of NF1 or molecular signatures of NF1 loss and test their response to our lead compounds in pre-clinical models. We expect that this work will provide new targets and therapeutic leads for aggressive neurological cancers driven by NF1 loss. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The work described in this proposal aims to find the Achilles heel of aggressive neurological cancers driven by NF1 loss for which no cure exists. These cancers include neurofibromas, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, glioblastoma (GBM), and neuroblastomas, all with dismal 5-year survival rates.

"Development of automated web-based spectroscopic MRI clinical interface Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common adult primary brain tumor and is highly aggressive in its disease course. Infiltration of glioma cells into surrounding normal brain make curative surgical resection of GBM impossible, and almost all will eventually recur. Thus, extraordinary significance is placed on radiation therapy (RT) strategies, which have been shown to be effective, but require strong imaging evidence to guide RT planning. Currently employed clinical imaging modalities include T1-weighted contrast-enhanced (CE) MRI, which only identifies leaky neovasculature associated with high grade tumor, and T2-weighted MRI, which is not specific for tumor infiltration. Through advances in neurosurgery, it is now possible to achieve complete or near-complete resection of the CE tumor component in many cases; thus, the region that is treated with the highest RT dose is limited to the empty resection cavity plus a small margin. Due to the generally larger size of the T2 area and unknown status of disease, it is treated to a lesser “microscopic disease” dose. Many times, however, this microscopic disease dose is inadequate to control the tumor. Spectroscopic MR imaging (sMRI) provides a highly sensitive and specific means of identifying these regions, although sMRI has not yet seen use in RT planning due to a lack of clinical decision support software for the analysis, display, and management of sMRI data. Three key hurdles to be overcome are: 1) lack of an automatic, fast and reliable method for spectral quality control; 2) the necessity of quantification of metabolite levels relative to a patient's baseline metabolism; and 3) a clinician- friendly display of the sMRI spectra encoded as a high-resolution, continuous, 3D image set for direct registration and incorporation into the RT planning process. Currently, sMRI processing requires skilled user intervention and shepherding data between several tools, resulting in a complex workflow that takes hours and is impractical for routine use in a fast-paced clinical RT environment. To automate this pipeline and provide clinically useful information to radiation oncologists, we seek to develop a software framework for the automated and expedient processing of sMRI for use in RT planning. We will use novel advances in the fields of high performance computing and deep learning. Specifically, we will develop algorithmic filters for identifying (and eliminating) spectral artifacts, algorithms for personalized localization of tumor infiltration, and methods and interfaces for the volumetric display of sMRI data needed for RT planning and review. Success in the proposed work will produce an automated “scanner-to-clinician” platform for quantitative, expedient, and objective analysis methods to integrate sMRI into routine clinical applications. This tool will also be highly valuable in the MRS-based diagnosis and evaluation of numerous other neuropathologies, including other primary (and metastatic) brain tumors, stroke, multiple sclerosis (and other demyelinating diseases), inborn errors of metabolism, and neurodegenerative diseases. Project Narrative There is widespread agreement that MR spectroscopy can provide valuable information without the need for exogenous contrast agents, however the software tools needed to incorporate whole brain 3D spectroscopic MRI (sMRI) into clinical practice are lacking. We plan to develop a web-based sMRI clinical interface for the analysis, visualization and integration of sMRI data into patient management. This “scanner-to-clinician” platform is designed to provide quantitative, expedient, and objective analysis in order to integrate sMRI into the routine radiation therapy planning process. In addition, this user-friendly tool will be highly valuable in the sMRI-based diagnosis and evaluation of numerous other neuropathologies aside from cancer, including other primary (and metastatic) brain tumors, stroke, multiple sclerosis (and other demyelinating diseases), inborn errors of metabolism, and neurodegenerative diseases.",Development of automated web-based spectroscopic MRI clinical

"Brain Cancer Radio-Pathomics for Predicting Heterogeneous Cytology Abstract High-grade brain cancer (glioblastoma) is a devastating disease that very few patients survive long-term. The average life expectancy is 15 months, and throughout therapy patients undergo serial MR imaging for monitoring tumor response. It is not well understood how heterogeneity at the cellular and molecular levels affects the macroscopic imaging characteristics of these tumors.  The long-term goal of this project is to provide imaging tools and biomarker integration strategies for individualizing glioblastoma treatment. The overall objective is to combine radiographic imaging with histopathological samples (i.e., radio-pathomics) to create and validate predictive tools for accurately defining tumor margins and spatial molecular profiles. Our central hypothesis is that microscopic glioblastoma cytological features and spatially dependent molecular profiles are reliably detectable and quantifiable with macroscopic MR imaging. Two specific aims will objectively test this hypothesis by first determining which microscopic tissue features contribute to distinct measurements with MR imaging, and second, determining the performance of machine learning algorithms for predictively mapping these heterogeneous histological features. ! Project Narrative This project will provide a detailed understanding of how brain tumors at the cellular level appear on macroscopic imaging by examining whole brain human samples and clinical MRI scans. We will develop computational algorithms trained with histology to recognize patterns in MRI scans (i.e. radiopathomics), which will negate the need for tissue.

"Quantitative Analysis of GBM Invasion Mechanisms with New Imaging Protocol DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glioblastoma (GBM, WHO grade IV) is the most common and highest-grade astrocytoma with uniformly dismal prognosis. In contrast to the lower grade gliomas (grades II and III), GBMs present radial growth rates almost 10 times as fast. Three pathophysiologic features, including necrosis, cellular pseudopalisades surrounding necrosis, and microvascular hyperplasia, are considered as hallmarks for GBM prognosis and are believed to be relevant to the drastically accelerated disease progression. Additionally, a population of Glioma Stem Cells (GCSs) has been found pertinent to the new neovascular formation, leading to GBM tumor outward growth. However, the definitive roles of these pathologic features and the associated signaling networks in GBM progression and their interactive mechanisms remain ill defined, because of limited capacity of biomarker observation and data analysis. The proposed project will create a new avenue for GBM research by leveraging computational power and machine intelligence for analyses of large-scale pathology images and spatially referenced, multiplexed biomarker data. A comprehensive system and analytical infrastructure will be developed to quantitatively investigate 1) spatial distributions f GBM invasion-related pathologic structures and GSCs, 2) functions of the in-situ signaling genes and regulatory networks responsible for GBM progression, and 3) the significance of morphologic, molecular, and signaling network variation across GBM microenvironments. A set of scalable image processing algorithms for analyses of spatial distributions and co-localizations of phenotypic features and biomarkers will be developed and applied to whole-slide pathology brightfield and quantum dot immunohistochemistry images of GBMs. Derived features and boundaries of phenotypic structures, and spatial distributions of biomarkers will be archived and integrated in a database for pathology and in-situ molecular imaging data where scientific queries can be invoked to support the analysis of GBM tumor progression mechanisms. In particular, multiplexed quantum dot immunohistochemistry (mQD-IHC), a new biomarker staining technique, will be leveraged to show the locations and expressions of multiple biomarkers of interest within the same tissue spatial reference. The combined expertise in large-scale pathology image process, high performance data computation, mQD-IHC staining technique for multiplexed biomarker investigation, and phenotype- genotype data integration supported by high-throughput data query power from customized database enables a unique research vehicle to investigate GBM tumor expansion mechanisms. Notably, the proposed research work can be generalized to catalyze other computational cancer research involving large-scale data and phenotype-genotype information integration. Therefore, it will present a broad impact on future translational research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Integrated analysis of spatial configurations of tissue pathologic features and underlying molecular biomarkers accounting for cancer progression is an important way to understand tumor expansion mechanisms. To advance in this research field, I propose to develop automated image analysis tools, database-based spatial integration methods, and mathematical models for tumor microenvironment representation to support quantitative investigations on Glioblastoma (GBM) brain tumor invasion mechanisms with definitive pathology imaging and multiplexed molecular biomarker data from whole-slide images of GBM

"Deconvolution of Epigenomic Data to Characterize Cellular Subpopulations Abstract With the advent of new DNA sequencing technologies, genomic data has moved to the forefront in the quest for individualized medicine. However, the lack of new computational tools to interpret and exploit the deluge of genomic data has severely hampered its clinical benefit. A further complication is that clinical genomic data is often obtained from tissues containing a mixture of different cell types. For example, tumor samples are a mixture of tumor subclones and normal cell lineages. As a platform for understanding this heterogeneity in tumor cell populations, our studies will focus on DNA methylation changes in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most prevalent, aggressive form of Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL). DNA methylation is cell type- specific, likely contributes to the phenotypic variation in tumor subclones, and plays key roles in gene regulation and lymphoma pathogenesis. Defining the methylation and transcriptional profiles of tumor subclones is necessary to identify potential drug targets, predict disease progression, and identify overall prognosis. Further, current computational approaches to understand epigenetic heterogeneity are not well- suited for tumor analysis and do not link epigenetic changes to expression. Here, we propose to develop a new computational approach that uses genomic methylation data from bulk samples to define DNA methylation- and expression-based subclonal populations and relate these populations to disease progression. Our approach exploits the fact that methylation levels are an accurate measure of the underlying distribution of allelic methylation states in the tumor (e.g. 30% methylation means 30% of the alleles are methylated). Our approach takes genome-wide methylation data as input, and outputs the number of subpopulations, their respective proportions, and each underlying subpopulation’s DNA methylation profile. After deconvolution, we will extend our previous work showing that DNA methylation profiles are predictive of expression levels, and apply tools from machine learning to estimate the relative expression profiles in each subpopulation. This approach will allow us to take advantage of the vast amount of data currently being collected in large-scale sequencing projects and obtain genome-wide methylation information from cellular subpopulations even when surface markers cannot be used to physically separate the different subpopulations. Lastly, we will assess the clinical relevance of these approaches by using them to understand the molecular changes found in tumor subpopulations from samples of relapsed DLBCL. We envision these methods can be applied as investigative tools first, and later as cost-effective clinical tools, to analyze the epigenetic and transcriptomic heterogeneity in different tumor types and diseased tissues. Public Narrative Tumors, including B-cell lymphomas, are comprised of heterogeneous populations of cells. Decoding the regulatory circuitry in these sub-populations is critical to understanding tumor metastasis, therapy resistance and relapse.

"Predicting brain tumor progression via multiparametric image analysis and modelin DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High-grade brain gliomas, the most common of which is glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), have terrible prognosis and a median patient survival of about 12 months. Although combinations of surgical removal, radiotherapy and chemotherapy are used in the clinical practice, a  fundamental and persistent limitation in treating these aggressive tumors is that they tend to  infiltrate into normal tissue well beyond margins visible via imaging. Since assessing the spatial  extent of tumor infiltration is nearly impossible using current radiologic reading practices, clinical  treatment tends to be restricted to parts that are deemed to be clearly malignant, frequently only  the enhancing tumor. This failure to aggressively treat the infiltrating tumor accelerates tumor  recurrence, and eventually patient death. This proposal aims to develop computational modeling  and image analysis methods that will improve our ability to estimate GBM infiltration, as well as  to predict tissue that is likelyto present fastest tumor recurrence, thereby eventually opening the  way for more aggressive, yet targeted, treatment, such as targeted aggressive surgical removal  and/or radiosurgery. To achieve our goal, we will integrate information from several sources:  1)  advanced multi-parametric imaging, which captures many aspects of tumor anatomy and  physiology~ 2) computational modeling of tumor growth and infiltration~ 3) machine learning  methods which, after appropriate training, can learn subtle and potentially complex imaging  phenotypes of infiltrating tumors~ 4) statistical atlases, which capture population-based trends  that can offer additional insights into tumor growth, such as relationship of infiltration to  vasculature and to white matter fiber pathways~ 5) data from one of the largest patient  populations having advanced imaging, genotyping, follow-up till tumor recurrence, and  histological analysis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop advance computational imaging and informatics methods for analysis  of high-grade gliomas (brain tumors). It will compile a unique database of data from several  hundred patients and will construct predictive models of infiltrating malignant tumor and of later  recurrence. Therefore, it will pave the way for more refined and targeted treatments of peritumoral brain tissue, which is where most tumor recurrence occurs.",Predicting brain tumor progression via multiparametric image analysis and modelin,9293390,R01NS042645,"['Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomy ', ' Atlases ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' Biophysics ', ' Biopsy ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' tumors in the brain ', ' Brain Tumors ', ' Brain Neoplasia ', ' Brain Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Communities ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Hydrops ', ' Dropsy ', ' Edema ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Future ', ' Genotype ', ' spongioblastoma multiforme ', ' glioblastoma multiforme ', ' Grade IV Astrocytoma ', ' Grade IV Astrocytic Tumor ', ' Grade IV Astrocytic Neoplasm ', ' Glioblastoma ', ' neuroglia tumor ', ' neuroglia neoplasm ', ' glial-derived tumor ', ' Neuroglial Tumor ', ' Neuroglial Neoplasm ', ' Glial Tumor ', ' Glial Neoplasm ', ' Glial Cell Tumors ', ' Glioma ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physiology ', ' Biological Preservation ', ' preservation ', ' Biologic Preservation ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prognosis ', ' Radiation-Sensitizing Agents ', ' radiosensitizer ', ' Radiosensitizing Drugs ', ' Radiosensitizing Agents ', ' Radiation-Sensitizing Drugs ', ' Radiation Sensitizers ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' Radiology ', ' General Radiology ', ' Radiation therapy ', ' treatment with radiation ', ' radio-therapy ', ' radiation treatment ', ' Radiotherapy ', ' Radiotherapeutics ', ' Reading ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' statistics ', ' Supervision ', ' Technology ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Vascularization ', ' Work ', ' radio-surgery ', ' Sterotactic External Beam Radiation ', ' Stereotaxic Radiosurgery ', ' Stereotactic Radiosurgery ', ' Stereotactic External Beam Irradiation ', ' Radiation Surgery ', ' Radiosurgery ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Cell Density ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' cancer progression ', ' tumor progression ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Clinical ', ' Malignant ', ' Malignant -

"Precision lung cancer therapy design through multiplexed adapter measurement Project Summary Combination therapy holds considerable promise for overcoming intrinsic and acquired resistance to targeted therapies but will rely on our ability to precisely identify the best drug combination for particular tumors. While immense focus exists on using genomic information to direct therapeutic approach, many resistance mechanisms do not rely on genetic changes and, in fact, can arise from entirely tumor-extrinsic factors within the microenvironment. For example, though the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) AXL is widely implicated in resistance to targeted therapies such as those directed against EGFR, its regulation by phosphatidylserine, as opposed to mutation, amplification or autocrine ligand, make identifying the tumors that will respond to AXL- targeted therapy especially challenging.  We propose to study both downstream and receptor-proximal signaling during bypass resistance mediated by AXL, and then across a wider panel of RTKs. Integrating these measurements with quantitative modeling will identify the connectivity between receptors, interacting adapters, and downstream signaling events, thereby defining the essential set of signaling network changes required for tumor cell survival in response to targeted therapeutics. We will then apply this understanding by measuring RTK-adapter interaction using proximity ligation to predict the RTKs driving bypass resistance and test these predictions in a panel of patient-derived xenograft tumors.  This work will considerably improve our ability to identify effective drug combinations by (a) developing a mechanism-based assay for identifying which among many RTKs tumor cells are relying upon for survival, (b) improving our basic understanding of exactly how network-level bypass resistance arises due to activation of non-targeted RTKs both at the receptor-proximal and downstream signaling layer, and (c) expanding our understanding of the RTK AXL with links to resistance, tumor spread, and immune avoidance. Project Narrative The proposed research is of immediate relevance to the public health mission of the NIH as it will considerably improve our understanding of resistance to targeted lung cancer therapies, which currently greatly limits their efficacy. This will focus development of new targeted drugs to overcome resistance, and optimize the application of therapy combinations for individual patients.",Precision lung cancer therapy design through multiplexed adapter measurement,9388399,U01CA215709,"['inhibitor ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' driving ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Cell Viability ', ' Cell Survival ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' multimodality therapy ', ' combined treatment ', ' combined modality treatment ', ' combination therapy ', ' Multimodality Treatment ', ' Multimodal Treatment ', ' Multimodal Therapy ', ' Combined Modality Therapy ', ' Drug Combinations ', ' Elements ', ' Ligands ', ' Ligation ', ' Closure by Ligation ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Statistical Models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Patients ', ' Phosphatidylserines ', ' Serine Phosphoglycerides ', ' Phosphorylation ', ' Protein Phosphorylation ', ' Proteins ', ' Public Health ', ' Complement Receptor ', ' Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor ', ' proto-oncogene protein c-erbB-1 ', ' erbBl ', ' erbB-1 Proto-Oncogene Protein ', ' erbB-1 ', ' c-erbB-1 Protein ', ' c-erbB-1 ', ' Urogastrone Receptor ', ' Transforming Growth Factor alpha Receptor ', ' TGF-alpha Receptor ', ' HER1 ', ' Epidermal Growth Factor-Urogastrone Receptors ', ' Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinase ', ' Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Kinase ', ' ERBB Protein ', ' EGFR ', ' EGF Receptor ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' ufo receptor ', ' UFO oncogene protein ', ' Tyrosine-Protein Kinase Receptor UFO ', ' AXL Protein ', ' axl receptor tyrosine kinase ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Tyrosine Kinase Receptors ', ' Tyrosine Kinase Linked Receptors ', ' Transmembrane Receptor Protein Tyrosine Kinase ', ' Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Gene ', ' PTK Receptors ', ' Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases ', ' Link ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' Measurement ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Immune ', ' Immunes ', ' Event ', ' Xenograft procedure ', ' xeno-transplantation ', ' xeno-transplant ', ' Xenotransplantation ', ' Xenograft ', ' Heterologous Transplantation ', ' Heterograft ', ' autocrine ', ' Autocrine Systems ', ' mutant ', ' neoplastic cell ', ' Tumor Cell ', ' receptor ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' receptor expression ', ' Bypass ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Genomics ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Adaptor Signaling Protein ', ' adapter protein ', ' Adaptor Signaling Protein Gene ', ' Adaptor Protein Gene ', ' Adaptor Protein ', ' RIPK1 gene ', ' Receptor-Interacting Serine/Threonine Kinase 1 ', ' Receptor-Interacting Protein ', ' RIPK1 ', ' RIP1 ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Receptor Activation ', ' in vivo ', ' resistant mechanism ', ' resistance mechanism ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' treatment resistance ', ' therapeutic resistance ', ' resistant to therapy ', ' resistance to therapy ', ' therapy resistant ', ' tumor xenograft ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' tumor ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' novel therapy target ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' novel pharmacotherapy target ', ' novel druggable target ', ' novel drug target ', ' new therapy target ', ' new pharmacotherapy target ', ' new druggable target ', ' new drug target ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted therapy ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' individual patient ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,U01,2017,446226,CA-33,0.09113684963107378
"Engineering personalized micro-tumor ecosystems Abstract Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in the United States, accounting for near 1 in every 4 deaths. However, despite the recent development of subtype-specific personalized therapy based on achievements in the fields of molecular and genetic profiling, many cancer treatments still have low efficacy which mostly arise from the limited ability to predict the patient tumor responses to therapeutic agents. The major reason that current therapeutics often cannot translate into a successful clinical outcomes is because of the complex tumor microenvironment and heterogeneity that limit the predictive power of the biomarker-guided strategies for chemotherapy. Therefore, the successful engineering of personalized three-dimensional (3D) tumor ecosystem that can recapitulate the tumor microenvironment and heterogeneity in vitro is strongly desired to accurately predict patients’ responses to anti-cancer drugs and thus further improve patient outcome. Here we propose to develop a personalized breast-cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip platform for personalized screening of cancer chemotherapeutics with high accuracy by utilizing patient-derived tumor explant, defined tumor grade-matched biomaterial matrices and autologous patient serum to mimic patient-specific tumor hallmarks. The proposed cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip will also be tightly regulated under physiological fluid dynamics. In this project, we have hypothesized that 1) the use of tumor explant will embrace the critical components of the tumor heterogeneity of the patient, 2) the combination of defined tumor grade-matched matrix, autologous patient serum, and a microfluidic bioreactor will prevent the phenotype alteration of the tumor explant, and 3) the integration of a machine-learning algorithm with the cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip platform will provide more accurate, unbiased prediction of the patient responses to chemotherapeutics based on the data gathered from the engineered tumor model. Our preliminary results show that the combination of tumor explant culture and tumor-derived matrix constituents had predicted therapeutic responses with 100% sensitivity. Our preliminary results show high specificity throughout a range of cancers including breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and thus the findings can have broad applications, and can emerge as a paradigm shift in the management of cancer. Narrative Despite the recent development of subtype-specific personalized therapy based on achievements in the fields of molecular and genetic profiling, the cancer treatment still has low efficacy that mostly arise from the limited ability of existing models to recapitulate the tumor heterogeneity and therefore predict the patient tumor responses to therapeutic agents. We propose to develop a novel personalized breast-cancer-ecosystem platform for personalized screening of cancer chemotherapeutics with extremely high accuracy by utilizing patient-derived tumor explant culture, defined tumor grade-matched biomaterial matrices, and autologous patient serum to mimic patient-specific tumor hallmarks.

"The CSBC Research Center for Cancer Systems Immunology at MSKCC SUMMARY Exciting clinical breakthroughs with checkpoint blockade antibodies and adoptive T cell transfers have transformed the field of cancer immunotherapy, demonstrating the power of harnessing the immune system to eliminate cancer cells. However, fundamental challenges and questions remain. Significant clinical responses have only been observed in a subset of patients and cancer types, and it is currently not known what biological properties of tumors determine clinical responses, nor what strategies to adopt in clinical contexts where current immunotherapies are ineffective. To ultimately address these clinical challenges and to design predictably effective cancer treatments, we must deepen our fundamental understanding of interactions between tumors and the immune system at the molecular, cellular, and systems levels. The CSBC Research Center for Cancer Systems Immunology at MSKCC will bring the tools of systems biology to investigate cancer-immune system interactions at multiple stages of disease progression to answer central questions in cancer immunology and inform the design of novel immunotherapeutic interventions. We have organized our Research Center around three central scientific projects that examine cancer-immune interactions at distinct stages of disease progression: cancer initiation and early tumorigenesis (Project I); established and progressing tumors (Project II); latent disease and metastasis in (Project III). In Project I, we will combine new epigenomics technologies and innovative single-cell analyses with state-of-the-art systems biology approaches to decipher the underlying molecular and epigenetic programs of dysfunctional tumor- specific T cell differentiation in early tumorigenesis. We will further elucidate how dynamics in the mutational tumor antigen landscape and stromal and immune cell populations determine such states and model and test in mouse and human tumors how distinct T cell states determine sensitivity to immune checkpoint blockade. In Project II, we will use quantitative analysis of cell types and cell states by functional, flow cytometric, population RNA-seq and droplet RNA sequencing together with ecological models of cancer, immune, and stromal cell populations to study the response of the tumor ecosystem to immunotherapeutic perturbations in established tumors. In Project III, we will examine the evolutionary dynamics of innate immune system control of metastatic disease, a new area of investigation in cancer immunology. We will investigate the heterogeneity of latent cancer cells in their capacity for immune evasion, and we will use quantitative methods, including live cell imaging, to model latent tumor cell evasion of innate immune control and the dynamics of cycles of latent cell proliferation and potential editing by NK cells. A Shared Resource Core will provide state-of-the-art single-cell droplet sequencing technology and computational analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data (scRNA- seq). This Shared Resource Core will be tasked with droplet sequencing technology development and design of novel algorithmic approaches and will interact with all three scientific Projects. Our Research Center will also carry out an innovative program of outreach and training activities at the local, national, and global levels to disseminate research findings in cancer systems immunology and to train young scientists in this emerging field. NARRATIVE Cancer immunotherapies are designed to harness the human immune system to attack cancer cells and eliminate tumors. Recent breakthroughs in cancer immunotherapy, such as checkpoint blockade agents, have generated great excitement, but in fact only a fraction of patients and tumor types respond to these new treatments. Our proposed Research Center will deploy tools from systems biology to study tumor-immune system interactions at multiple stages to disease progression at the molecular, cellular, and systems levels,

"Dissecting Therapeutic Resistance and Progression in Metastatic Melanoma Through Clinical Computational Oncology Project Summary  The development of targeted therapy (BRAF/MEKi) and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) targeting the co-inhibitory receptors CTLA-4 and PD-1 have revolutionized the treatment of metastatic melanoma. However, only a subset of patients maintain durable responses, and many people experience substantial side effects of therapy. Predicting therapeutic response in individual patients remains a critical and unresolved issue. Furthermore, the series of key genomic and epigenetic events driving progression and resistance to therapy is incompletely understood. The guiding hypothesis of this proposal is that (a) resistance to ICB and targeted therapy is mediated by tumor intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms, some of which may be elucidated by systematic multi-modal molecular characterization of the tumor and tumor microenvironment; and (b) applying modern machine-learning and statistical approaches to molecular and clinical data from patient tumors will inform development of new therapeutic approaches and predictive models to improve patient care.  Identifying and validating predictors of intrinsic resistance to BRAF/MEKi and ICB across large human cohorts has been limited to date. Aim 1 of this proposal applies genomic and transcriptomic characterization of pre-treatment tumors to large cohorts of patients treated with BRAF/MEKi, PD-1i, and CTLA-4i in order to discover and to validate molecular and clinical markers of response and resistance. Machine learning approaches will integrate these markers into parsimonious models predicting response. A differential analysis using mutual information will be conducted to reveal markers that predict differential response to therapy.  A significant proportion of patients do not respond or maintained sustained responses to immunotherapy, and there is a critical need to characterize the acquisition or selection of drivers that confer resistance to immunotherapy. Aim 2 of this proposal develops algorithms using molecular characterization of longitudinally collected tumor samples across multiple anatomic sites to discover genomic and epigenetic drivers of progression and resistance to immunotherapy using phylogenetic analysis as the backbone of discovery.  Finally, the ability to detect novel tumor driver mutations present at low frequencies is strongly dependent on cohort size. Aim 3 of this proposal leverages all genomically characterized melanomas to perform a meta- analysis using state-of-the-art and novel algorithms to discover novel driver mutations present at low frequencies with a focus on tumor subsets that lack known targetable drivers.  These studies will expand the actionable landscape of genomic and epigenetic alterations in metastatic melanoma, advance our understanding of intrinsic and acquired resistance to targeted and immunotherapies in melanoma, and establish a framework to predict response in individual patients, which may impact patient care in melanoma and have applicability in other disease settings. Project Narrative  New targeted and immunotherapies have revolutionized the treatment and extended the prognosis of metastatic melanoma, but only a subset of patients have durable responses, and our ability to predict who will benefit from which treatment is limited. Further, the specific alterations driving tumor progression and resistance to therapy are not well characterized, but may inform the development of new therapeutic targets and combination therapies. This proposal aims to integrate molecular data from patient tumor samples and their clinical context to predict response to targeted and immunotherapies, and dissect the drivers of progression and resistance to therapy in individual patients.",Dissecting Therapeutic Resistance and Progression in Metastatic Melanoma Through Clinical Computational Oncology,9646469,K08CA234458,"['Algorithms ', '

"Quantifiable Thermal Therapy Using Magnetic Resonance Thermometry Imaging Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States, and is characterized with dismal odds due to advanced disease at late stage diagnosis. The 5-year survival rate ranges from 7% for patients with non-resectable disease (~80% of patients), to ~23% for patients with resectable tumors (< 20%of patients). PDAC, like most solid tumors, is highly hypoxic, resulting from both poor oxygen delivery due to leaky and chaotic vasculature and increased oxygen consumption due to high metabolic activity. This makes drug delivery to the tumor microenvironment more difficult and often ineffective. In the past 40 years, only marginal improvements in complete response (CR), progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and quality of life (QoL) have occurred despite the development of a number of promising chemotherapy, or chemoradiation regimens. New and improved therapeutic options are urgently needed to improve the treatment of this disease. Mild hyperthermia (HT) in the range of 39-42°C has shown to improve blood flow to tumors, enhancing the delivery of therapeutics to the hypoxic tumor microenvironment. Numerous randomized clinical trials have shown to provide CR, PFS, OR and QoL benefits but implementation in clinical practice has been lagging due to the inability to provide safe, quantifiable and controlled therapeutic thermal dose through accurate temperature monitoring. NTO has designed and built the VectronTTx device which can effectively deliver heat non-invasively in deep tissue without causing skin burns or excessive fat heating (the most common adverse effect encountered with current technologies) without the need for a cooling mechanism such as a water bolus that is a frequent cause for interrupted treatments due to patient discomfort. The heating elements of the device are integrated into an applicator with magnetic resonance (MR) transmit and receive channels to allow for real-time MR thermometry imaging (MRTI) measurements. In this Phase I proposal, we will develop novel MRTI methodologies that significantly improve the state-of-the-art by accurately measuring temperature over HT treatment time scales (30-60 minutes) in an abdominal environment compensating for interfering processes including field drift and motion-induced field variations. We will also develop a treatment- modeling architecture that combines virtual models, patient-specific features, and an artificial intelligence (AI)- based architecture to create extrapolated patient-specific treatment plans. Upon successful completion of Phase I and validation of the developed real-time MRTI monitoring techniques, we will develop methods in Phase II for accurate measurements of temperature in fat by incorporating interleaved or hybrid fat-based techniques into the field-corrected MRTI sequences. In phase II, we will also develop and implement the infrastructure to perform personalized treatment planning. This treatment planning will be based on conventional image transformations, conventional EM-solving, and AI learning of thermal sink and tissue properties. Numerous clinical trials have shown that mild hyperthermia in conjunction with chemotherapy or radiation therapy is a promising strategy to treat cancer. However, adoption in the clinic will require the ability to measure temperature in the heated regions both for safety and to verify tumor heating. NeoTherma Oncology (NTO) has developed a device that can heat tumors non-invasively within a Magnetic Resonance scanner (MR), which will allow the MR to be used to map temperatures inside the body. In this proposal, NTO and the University of Utah will develop MR methods that will provide accurate and precise measurement of temperature in near real-time, allowing evaluation of this device for clinical use.",Quantifiable Thermal Therapy Using Magnetic Resonance Thermometry Imaging,9623256,R43CA233401,"['Abdomen ', ' Abdominal ', ' Adoption ', ' Aftercare ', ' post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' Algorithms ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Burn injury ', ' burned ', ' Burns ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Fats ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Heating ', ' Hybrids ', ' In Vitro ', ' Industrialization ', ' Learning ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Maps ', ' Medical Device ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Motion ', ' Noise ', ' Oxygen ', ' O2 element ', ' O element ', ' Oxygen Consumption ', ' Paper ', ' Patients ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prognosis ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Radiation therapy ', ' treatment with radiation ', ' radio-therapy ', ' radiation treatment ', ' Radiotherapy ', ' Radiotherapeutics ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Safety ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Technology ', ' Temperature ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Utah ', ' Water ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Work ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Measures ', ' Drug Delivery Systems ', ' Drug Delivery ', ' Device Safety ', ' Visualization ', ' Imagery ', ' base ', ' dosage ', ' Organ ', ' Thermometry ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' hyperthermia therapy ', ' clinical hyperthermia ', ' hyperthermia treatment ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Blood flow ', ' Oxygen Deficiency ', ' Hypoxic ', ' Hypoxia ', ' Measurement ', ' Progression-Free Survivals ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' oncology ', ' Solid Tumor ', ' Solid Neoplasm ', ' Collaborations ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Metabolic ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Pulse ', ' Scientist ', ' Adopted ', ' chemoradiation ', ' radiochemotherapy ', ' radio-chemotherapy ', ' radio-chemo-therapy ', ' chemoradiotherapy ', ' chemo-radiotherapy ', ' chemo-radio-therapy ', ' chemo-/radio-therapy ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' respiratory ', ' Ablation ', ' experience ', ' treatment planning ', ' Adjuvant Therapy ', ' In complete remission ', ' complete response ', ' advanced disease ', ' advanced illness ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' Adverse effects ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Magnetic Resonance ', ' Skin ', ' Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma ', ' Pancreas Ductal Adenocarcinoma ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Bolus Infusion ', ' Bolus ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Interruption ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Resectable ', ' Therapeutic Studies ', ' Therapy Research ', ' in vivo ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' Cardiac ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' cancer microenvironment ', ' tumor microenvironment ', ' virtual ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' imaging Segmentation ', ' chemotherapy ', ' prototype ', ' tumor ', ' standard of care ', ' clinical practice ', ' Regimen ', ' Hyperthermia ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized medicine ', ' radio frequency ', ' crowdsource ', ' crowd-sourcing ', ' crowd source ', ' crowdsourcing ', ' improved outcome ', ' data archive ', ' real time monitoring ', ' Hypoxic tumor ', ' tumor hypoxia ', ' ']",NCI,"NEOTHERMA ONCOLOGY, INC.",R43,2018,299014,KS-04,0.06401072160789285
"Topology of Cancer Evolution and Heterogeneity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In solid tumors, current limitations in our ability to identify the cell(s) of origin, track the dynamics of tumor subclonal architecture over space and time, and predict drug sensitivities in a mechanistic fashion pose significant challenges to our ability to develop effective treatments and undermine the utility of available therapies, particularly in tumors that become resistant. In this proposal, we argue that approaches based in mathematics and physics are well suited for addressing these critical problems. Historically, the physical sciences have been successful in solving fundamental scientific problems by producing reductionist models that enable the development of conceptual premises, technological breakthroughs that enable new kinds of measurements, and mathematical tools that can accurately represent and predict future activity. In this new Columbia University Physical Sciences-Oncology Center for Topology of Cancer Evolution and Heterogeneity (CUPS-OC), our goal is to develop, validate, and deliver a set of complementary mathematical, technological, and computational approaches that will provide the cancer research community with a framework for unraveling complexity in solid tumors, with the long-term aim of improving diagnosis and treatment. More specifically, the Center's primary research focus will be to study evolution and heterogeneity of solid tumors at the single cell level, by developing lineage tracing techniques in organoid and in vivo systems, single cell sequencing in primary tumors, and emerging genomics-based approaches for identifying targeted therapies. These experimental approaches will be supported by the development of novel, robust, and effective mathematical and computational approaches based in the field of topology, which offers unique and powerful methods for addressing the essential challenge of interpreting the high-dimensional data sets that state-of-the- art genomics technologies generate. In addition, we will promote the integration of physical science approaches into cancer research by both training new researchers and engaging established researchers working at the intersection of the physical sciences and cancer biology. Each of the projects and cores will address technical, mathematical, and biological challenges, contributing to the global enterprise of cancer research and to the development of a broader network of interdisciplinary researchers committed to advancing the field. If successful, we will be able to provide the scientific community with experimentally validated geometric and topological structures of causal inference of clonal evolution, single cell genomic protocols for fast and reliable uncovering of clonal heterogeneity, experimentally validated machine learning approaches for predicting drug sensitivities, and a strong multi-institutional, interdisciplinary program that creates bridges between researchers in pure mathematics, the technology sector, and cancer research.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cancer heterogeneity has been postulated as a major evolutionary force behind drug resistance. The Columbia University Physical Sciences-Oncology Center for Topology of Cancer Evolution and Heterogeneity (CUPS-OC) will develop quantitative approaches to understand, study and find potential

"Predicting brain tumor progression via multiparametric image analysis and modelin DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High-grade brain gliomas, the most common of which is glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), have terrible prognosis and a median patient survival of about 12 months. Although combinations of surgical removal, radiotherapy and chemotherapy are used in the clinical practice, a  fundamental and persistent limitation in treating these aggressive tumors is that they tend to  infiltrate into normal tissue well beyond margins visible via imaging. Since assessing the spatial  extent of tumor infiltration is nearly impossible using current radiologic reading practices, clinical  treatment tends to be restricted to parts that are deemed to be clearly malignant, frequently only  the enhancing tumor. This failure to aggressively treat the infiltrating tumor accelerates tumor  recurrence, and eventually patient death. This proposal aims to develop computational modeling  and image analysis methods that will improve our ability to estimate GBM infiltration, as well as  to predict tissue that is likelyto present fastest tumor recurrence, thereby eventually opening the  way for more aggressive, yet targeted, treatment, such as targeted aggressive surgical removal  and/or radiosurgery. To achieve our goal, we will integrate information from several sources:  1)  advanced multi-parametric imaging, which captures many aspects of tumor anatomy and  physiology~ 2) computational modeling of tumor growth and infiltration~ 3) machine learning  methods which, after appropriate training, can learn subtle and potentially complex imaging  phenotypes of infiltrating tumors~ 4) statistical atlases, which capture population-based trends  that can offer additional insights into tumor growth, such as relationship of infiltration to  vasculature and to white matter fiber pathways~ 5) data from one of the largest patient  populations having advanced imaging, genotyping, follow-up till tumor recurrence, and  histological analysis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop advance computational imaging and informatics methods for analysis  of high-grade gliomas (brain tumors). It will compile a unique database of data from several  hundred patients and will construct predictive models of infiltrating malignant tumor and of later  recurrence.

"Systems biology modeling of radiation resistance and chemotherapy-radiation combination therapies in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma Tumor resistance to radiation therapy remains a significant obstacle to long-term cancer patient survival, especially for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), a cancer type with poor long-term outcomes (less than 50% advanced stage five-year survival). To overcome the problem of radiation resistance, radiation therapy is being combined with radiation-sensitizing chemotherapies. Prediction of an individual’s sensitivity to radiation and specific chemotherapy-radiation combination therapies prior to treatment would improve the development of personalized treatment plans for cancer patients. Efforts are being made to create systems biology models of cancer cells for biomarker discovery and prediction of treatment response; however, due to methodological shortcomings, failure to integrate multi-omic data on a genome-scale, and lack of specificity to individual patient tumors, these predictive models have yet to be implemented clinically. To address these needs, the objective of this project is to develop a personalized systems biology modeling platform for individualized prediction of HNSCC patient tumor response to radiation and chemotherapy-radiation combination therapies. These models will be created by first integrating comprehensive biological data on individual patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). This approach will allow for the comparison of metabolic, signaling, and phenotypic signatures between radiation-sensitive and radiation-resistant patient tumors. By then integrating the mechanisms of action of radiation therapy and radiation-sensitizing chemotherapies into the modeling framework, the response to particular chemotherapy-radiation combination therapies in individual radiation- resistant patient tumors can be predicted. Machine learning classifiers will be developed from TCGA patient data and model predictions to determine which biological and clinical factors are most predictive of radiation sensitivity and chemotherapy-radiation combination therapy success. It is hypothesized that differential response to chemotherapy-radiation combination therapies in radiation-resistant HNSCC tumors is accomplished through redox metabolism and signaling, and components of redox biology within the modeling framework will significantly enrich the list of predictive biomarkers for combination therapy success. Although the focus of this project will be on HNSCC, this systems biology modeling approach will be applicable to any cancer type. The outcomes of this project will be a reduced set of clinically-measurable biomarkers for accurate prediction of HNSCC patient response to radiation therapy and specific chemotherapy-radiation combination therapies, as well as a precision medicine platform to test clinically relevant therapeutic strategies. This project is innovative because it combines multi-omic cancer patient data with state-of-the-art systems biology modeling techniques to investigate the biological mechanisms of radiation resistance, as well as to predict chemotherapy-radiation combination therapy response in individual radiation-resistant patients. Combination therapies that include both radiation and chemotherapy are currently being developed for cancer patients that do not respond well to radiation therapy alone. This research will provide insights into why particular head and neck cancer patients do not respond well to radiation therapy, as well as predict which chemotherapy- radiation combination treatments will be most effective for individual patients. Findings from this research will improve our ability to develop personalized treatment plans for cancer patients, which will decrease healthcare costs and improve patient outcomes.",Systems biology

"(PQ2) PD-L1/PD-1 signals in aged hosts undergoing cancer immunotherapy This proposal combines a team with expertise in aging, tumor immunology, tumor immunotherapy, specific genetically modified animal models and early phase clinical trials with a computational team having great expertise in analyzing and modeling aging of the immune system. We will study age effects on PD-L1/PD-1 signaling in the host and the tumor focusing on melanoma with some bladder cancer work, two tumors that are highly responsive to αPD-1 and/or αPD-L1 as proofs-of-concept, and residing in distinct anatomic compartments. In Aim 1 we study tumor PD-L1 intrinsic effects on αPD-L1 and αPD-1 treatment in melanoma and bladder cancer using transplantable B16 and inducible Nras/Cdk2n melanoma models, and transplantable MB49 and BBN-induced tumors for bladder cancer studies. We also use novel melanoma and BC models with tumor cell- specific PD-L1KO. We study 3 cohorts of elderly versus younger humans getting αPD-L1 or αPD-1 for melanoma or bladder cancer for human validation. We measure high-dimensional cell phenotypes and signaling responses, proteins and genes to maximize the information collected from human samples and mice using 23-color FACS, CyTOF, Luminex, Nanostring and other approaches. In Aim 2 we use all the above models and analytic strategies in young and aged PD-L1KO mice and WT or bone marrow chimeras to test hematopoietic and non- hematopoietic (host) PD-L1 signals in treatment outcomes in melanoma and bladder cancer. In Aim 3 the Systems Immunology team will use their innovative and successful computational modeling to identify age- related co-predictors of immunotherapy response and to identify candidate mechanisms for responders and non- responders. We will define a trajectory of immune system aging in mice at ultra-high resolution by performing a systems level integrative analysis of aging in Collaborative Cross and BL6 mice tracked in a combined longitudinal and cross-sectional study. This trajectory will be used to understand how tumor response and treatment outcomes vary as a function of age, and to build a simple, low parameter (i.e., easily testable and clinically translated), predictive models of treatment response. We will test insights by analyzing immune data from aged versus young patients undergoing αPD-L1 and αPD-1 cancer immunotherapy in novel machine learning approaches that we pioneered to identify insights from mouse data that are relevant to humans. Coupling this disease information with the healthy human aging trajectory that we recently defined will allow us to adapt our mouse data to predict optimal treatments in humans based on chronological and immune aging. This combined trans-disciplinary approach will identify common age-related disabilities that reduce PD-L1/PD-1 based immunotherapy responses and suggest tailored treatments for optimal efficacy that could later be tested in validation sets. These data can also be applied to other types of immunotherapy as we will also test. Cancer is a disease of the aged, but therapies are generally modeled in the young. We study age effects on cancer immunotherapy in response to PQ2 to develop ways to optimize cancer immunotherapy in aged patients most at risk. We focus on the PD-L1/PD-1 axis that is the cornerstone of the most successful cancer immunotherapies to date.",(PQ2) PD-L1/PD-1 signals in aged hosts undergoing cancer

"Bayesian learning algorithms for identifying and classifying heterogeneity of cell types in variety of solid tumors Abstract Solid tumors are comprise the large majority of cancers (>90%). Standard of diagnosis and care often involved serial MR imaging for monitoring tumor response. It is not well understood how heterogeneity at the cellular and molecular levels affects the macroscopic imaging characteristics of these tumors. The long-term goal of this project is to provide computation tools for understanding the histopathologic variation of solid tumors and aid the development of image guided therapies for individualizing solid tumor treatment. The overall objective is to combine radiographic imaging with histopathological samples (i.e., radio-pathomics) to create and validate predictive tools for accurately defining tumor margins and spatial molecular profiles. Our central hypothesis is that microscopic cytological features and spatially dependent molecular profiles are reliably detectable and quantifiable with macroscopic MR imaging and that they can contribute towards the development of adaptive radiation therapy (ART). Two specific aims will objectively test this hypothesis by first determining which microscopic tissue features contribute to distinct measurements with MR imaging, and second, determining the development of fast and accurate computational tools for using MR image guided radiation therapy in clinical settings. Project Narrative The proposal aims to advance our current understanding of the association of malignant solid tumors at the cellular level. We plan to develop fast computational tools for real time image guided radiation, personalized to individual variations in cancer patients. Overall, this will help improve cancer diagnosis and treatment by better differentiation between healthy and aggressive cancer tissue, and by improved precision for targeted therapy.",Bayesian learning algorithms for identifying and classifying heterogeneity of cell types in variety of solid tumors,9603869,R21CA231892,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Computer-Assisted Image Analysis ', ' feature recognition ', ' feature detection ', ' content based retrieval ', ' Computer-Assisted Image Analyses ', ' Cytology ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Glioblastoma ', ' spongioblastoma multiforme ', ' glioblastoma multiforme ', ' Grade IV Astrocytoma ', ' Grade IV Astrocytic Tumor ', ' Grade IV Astrocytic Neoplasm ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Histology ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Maps ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Minor ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prognosis ', ' Prostate ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Radiation therapy ', ' treatment with radiation ', ' radio-therapy ', ' radiation treatment ', ' Radiotherapy ', ' Radiotherapeutics ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' United States ', ' Diagnostic radiologic examination ', ' X-Ray Medical Imaging ', ' X-Ray Imaging ', ' Roentgenography ', ' Radiography ', ' Diagnostic X-Ray Radiology ', ' Diagnostic X-Ray ', ' Diagnostic Radiology ', ' Conventional X-Ray ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Brain ', ' Brain Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of brain ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Malignant ', ' Malignant -

"Towards the automation of MR spectroscopic imaging in patients with glioblashoma Glioblastoma is the most common adult primary brain tumor and is highly aggressive in its disease course. Despite advances in neurosurgical resection, radiation targeting, and chemotherapy, the prognosis remains grim with a median survival of just 15 months. The effectiveness of current radiation therapy strategies is severely limited by shortcomings in the imaging modalities used to develop treatment plans. Current radiation therapy planning is mainly based on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI, which identifies high grade tumors that are immediately associated with leaky neovasculature. Although it is an excellent diagnostic tool to identify high grade from low grade tumors, it is unable to signal occult infiltration beyond the core of the tumor. Though many believe GBM to be an incurable disease, we believe we have identified a method for optimizing tumor targeting that will increase the effectiveness of radiation therapy. A significant component of the current problem in GBM therapy is the lack of treatment for non-enhancing regions that are significantly infiltrated by neoplastic glioma cells without neovascularization. This untreated population undoubtedly leads to early recurrence. The proposed study addresses an important step toward translating an advanced quantitative imaging modality that complements the conventional imaging that is capable of reliably revealing glioma- infiltrated regions for precise, personalized treatment targeting. Proton spectroscopic magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) is an alternative modality able to identify endogenous metabolism within tissue without the need for exogenous contrast, and has been shown to identify the metabolic abnormalities associated with tumor beyond the regions identified by T1-weighted MRI. The clinical integration of sMRI in patient management has been limited due to the computational challenges of analysis of sMRI data. Two key hurdles to be overcome are the insufficiency of filters to remove image artifacts and the necessity of quantification of metabolic levels relative to a patient's baseline metabolism. As a result, sMRI processing requires skilled user intervention and many hours of computational and user time. To automate this pipeline and provide clinically useful information to oncologists, we seek to develop a software framework for the automated and expedient processing of sMRI for use in radiation therapy planning. We will use novel advances in the fields of high performance computing and deep learning, an approach to computation that has shattered benchmarks in many medical and non-medical problems. Specifically, we will develop filters for removing artifacts, algorithms for personalized diagnosis of tumor infiltration, and explore deep learning as a method to synthesize sMRI data with anatomical and clinical metrics in a fully automated fashion. Success in the proposed work will produce a “scanner-to-clinician” platform for quantitative, expedient, and objective analysis methods to integrate sMRI into the clinical radiation therapy planning paradigm. Ultimately, we believe this additional modality in the physician's tool belt will lead to better outcomes in patients suffering from this debilitating disease. Project Narrative  Proton spectroscopic magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) is a molecular imaging modality that can accurately detect abnormalities in the metabolic signatures of tumor cells, making it ideal for the detection and monitoring of highly infiltrative brain tumors like glioblastoma. Clinical adoption of sMRI has been slow due to limited tools for expedient and objective processing of sMRI data into information that oncologists can use for therapy planning. This proposal addresses these challenges using recent advances in high performance computing and machine learning to develop a software framework for using sMRI in the clinical management of patients

"Targeting Tumors with NF1 Loss ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Genomic information can allow investigators to devise precision therapies that target molecular lesions specific to a patient's cancer. One of the molecular lesions present in many malignant tumors is loss of the NF1 tumor suppressor, which is a driver in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), one of the most frequently inherited genetic disorders. NF1 exhibits a broad clinical spectrum including benign nervous system tumors called neurofibromas, low-grade astrocytomas, pheochromocytoma, and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. Plexiform neurofibromas (PN) occur in deep nerves and can degenerate into malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), chemo- and radiation-resistant sarcomas with a dismal 20% five-year survival rate. In NF1 carriers, the lifetime risk is 30% for PN and 8-15% for MPNST. NF1 mutations are also found in sporadic tumors including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), melanoma, pheochromocytoma, ovarian, uterine, and lung cancers. Furthermore, in animal models and human tumor lines NF1 loss has been shown to drive GBM. A targeted molecular therapy designed to inhibit tumor-initiating and -promoting cells would substantially advance our ability to treat tumors that develop as a result of NF1 loss. Using complementary screening platforms, we identified small molecules that selectively killed or stopped the growth of cells carrying a mutation in NF1 as well as their molecular targets. In this application we focus on our top small molecule leads and the power of our model systems to test the hypothesis that aggressive neurological cancers that are known to be driven by NF1 loss and for which no cure exists, including PN, MPNST and GBM, will respond to molecules that we identified as synthetic lethal with NF1 loss. For this, we will determine pharmacokinetic properties of our top small molecule leads and, where needed, conduct structure-activity relationship studies to improve kinetics and/or reduce toxicity in order to test their efficacy in pre-clinical models of PN and GBM. We will leverage our model systems to define the mechanisms of action of our small molecule leads and add to our pipeline drugs in clinical trials that share the same targets. In addition to mutational inactivation, some GBM tumors exhibit down-regulation of the NF1 protein. Our lead compounds also stopped the growth of human GBM and neuroblastoma cells with low NF1 protein in vitro, supporting the broad application of the small molecule leads that we have identified. To capture tumors that have lost NF1 by any mechanism, we constructed an RNA-based classifier, which is capable of identifying downstream transcriptomic effects that indicate NF1 inactivation in GBM, using machine learning. We will apply the RNA-based classifier, along with targeted sequencing of NF1, to identify additional patient derived xenograft (PDX) GBM tumors that have an inactivating mutation of NF1 or molecular signatures of NF1 loss and test their response to our lead compounds in pre-clinical models. We expect that this work will provide new targets and therapeutic leads for aggressive neurological cancers driven by NF1 loss. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The work described in this proposal aims to find the Achilles heel of aggressive neurological cancers driven by NF1 loss for which no cure exists. These cancers include neurofibromas, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, glioblastoma (GBM), and neuroblastomas, all with dismal 5-year survival rates. Our multidisciplinary approach to develop an innovative conduit for identifying new targets with potential to cure such malignancies addresses an unmet clinical need.",Targeting Tumors with NF1

"Brain Cancer Radio-Pathomics for Predicting Heterogeneous Cytology Abstract High-grade brain cancer (glioblastoma) is a devastating disease that very few patients survive long-term. The average life expectancy is 15 months, and throughout therapy patients undergo serial MR imaging for monitoring tumor response. It is not well understood how heterogeneity at the cellular and molecular levels affects the macroscopic imaging characteristics of these tumors.  The long-term goal of this project is to provide imaging tools and biomarker integration strategies for individualizing glioblastoma treatment. The overall objective is to combine radiographic imaging with histopathological samples (i.e., radio-pathomics) to create and validate predictive tools for accurately defining tumor margins and spatial molecular profiles. Our central hypothesis is that microscopic glioblastoma cytological features and spatially dependent molecular profiles are reliably detectable and quantifiable with macroscopic MR imaging. Two specific aims will objectively test this hypothesis by first determining which microscopic tissue features contribute to distinct measurements with MR imaging, and second, determining the performance of machine learning algorithms for predictively mapping these heterogeneous histological features. ! Project Narrative This project will provide a detailed understanding of how brain tumors at the cellular level appear on macroscopic imaging by examining whole brain human samples and clinical MRI scans. We will develop computational algorithms trained with histology to recognize patterns in MRI scans (i.e. radiopathomics), which will negate the need for tissue. Patient care and clinical decision-making will improve dramatically as a complete picture of histological features underlying brain tumor imaging emerges from this proposal.",Brain Cancer Radio-Pathomics for Predicting Heterogeneous Cytology,9502939,R01CA218144,"['Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain Neoplasms ', ' tumors in the brain ', ' Brain Tumors ', ' Brain Neoplasia ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Contrast Media ', ' Radiopaque Media ', ' Contrast Drugs ', ' Contrast Agent ', ' Cytology ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Gadolinium ', ' Gd element ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Glioblastoma ', ' spongioblastoma multiforme ', ' glioblastoma multiforme ', ' Grade IV Astrocytoma ', ' Grade IV Astrocytic Tumor ', ' Grade IV Astrocytic Neoplasm ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Histology ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Learning ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' Radiology ', ' General Radiology ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Weight ', ' Wisconsin ', ' Diagnostic radiologic examination ', ' X-Ray Medical Imaging ', ' X-Ray Imaging ', ' Roentgenography ', ' Radiography ', ' Diagnostic X-Ray Radiology ', ' Diagnostic X-Ray ', ' Diagnostic Radiology ', ' Conventional X-Ray ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Brain ', ' Brain Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of brain ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Microscopic ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Histologically ', ' Histologic ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Oncologist ', ' radiologist ', ' cancer cell ', ' Malignant Cell ', ' Pathologist ', ' Brain Glioblastoma ', ' Grade IV Brain Astrocytoma ', ' Grade IV Brain Astrocytic Tumor ', ' Grade IV Brain Astrocytic Neoplasm ', ' Brain Glioblastoma Multiforme ', ' Specimen ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' brain tissue ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgeon ', ' Performance ', ' Biopsy Specimen ', ' Biopsy Sample ', ' novel ', ' Radiation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' MRI Scans ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' Tumor Cell Invasion ', ' Tumor Invasion ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' Radio ', ' Detection ', ' Imaging Device ', ' Imaging Tool ', ' Imaging Instrument ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' molecular signature ', ' molecular profile ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' Radiation Oncologist ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Pathologic ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' tumor imaging ', ' oncology imaging ', ' oncologic imaging ', ' cancer imaging ', ' Imaging technology ', ' prospective ', ' Stress Tests ', ' computer algorithm ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' tumor ', ' evidence base ', ' treatment strategy ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' unique treatment ', ' tailored treatment ', ' tailored therapy ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' individualized treatment ', ' individualized therapy ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' customized treatment ', ' customized therapy ', ' individualized medicine ', ' personalized cancer treatment ', ' individualized cancer therapy ', ' personalized cancer therapy ', ' contrast enhanced ', ' contrast imaging ', ' imaging marker ', ' imaging biomarker ', ' intratumor heterogeneity ', ' intra-tumoral heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneity in tumors ', ' Intratumoral heterogeneity ', ' tumor heterogeneity ', ' individualized strategies ', ' personalized strategies ', ' intertumoral heterogeneity ', ' Inter-tumoral heterogeneity ', ' Tissue imaging ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictive tools ', ' radiomics ', ' imaging study ', ' therapy optimization ', ' treatment optimization ', ' ']",NCI,MEDICAL COLLEGE OF WISCONSIN,R01,2018,352275,WI-05,0.1180022273500254
"(PQD-3) Spatiotemporal Molecular Interrogation of Early Metastatic Evolution In Situ ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every single cancer survivor fears relapse. While being free of the primary tumor after treatment is encouraging, it is emotionally devastating to step out of the clinic after a yearly checkup with a diagnosis of metastatic disease. Approximately 90% of cancer lethality is due to metastasis - the spreading of primary tumor cells to distant organs. Despite a dramatic increase in early screening methods and comprehensive treatment regimens for primary breast tumors, the overall mortality of patients who relapsed with metastatic cancer in the US has not changed in the past two decades. Clinical failure in treating metastatic tumors is largely due to the evolutionary nature of tumor metastasis. In order to survive and establish secondary tumors in a different tissue microenvironment at distant organs, disseminated tumor cells have to adapt (metastatic evolution) to the host environment. Clinically, metastatic tumors exhibit drastically different characteristics from their primary counterpart. Therefore, current cancer treatments, designed based on the features of primary tumors, are rarely effective.          Optimal design of breakthrough anti-metastasis therapies relies on our in-depth understanding of the common and functionally important traits during the early metastatic evolution. In this proposed study, we will use breast cancer brain metastasis as model system and take state-of-the-art approaches to trace and analyze a single cancer cell within its precise metastatic microenvironment from the initial moment of metastatic colonization. This collaborative effort from a multidisciplinary team, including a cancer biologist, a computational biologist, a mathematician and a bioinformatician will allow us to: 1) depict the dynamics of gene transcription during the different stages of brain metastasis at single cell level; 2) visualize th behavior of a single colonized metastatic tumor cell and its interaction with the microenvironment through real-time intravital imaging and deep tissue imaging; 3) mathematically integrate molecular (RNA-seq), behavioral (intravital) and structural (deep tissue imaging) information to identify the common and functionally important early metastatic evolutionary traits during the breast cancer brain metastasis in its native tissue context.          Shifting the current clinical treatment model relies on new in-depth mechanistic insight obtained through basic and pre-clinical innovative research. Utilizing cutting-edge sequencing and imaging modality in our proposed study, we will have the capacity to systematically dissect traits of early metastatic behavior and discover potential novel therapeutic targets for paradigm-shifting novel adjuvant therapy tailored to specific target metastatic evolution. The conceptual validation from our bold and pioneering attempt proposed in this study will serves as a blueprint for a new category of adjuvant therapies for effective anti-metastasis treatment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful anti-metastasis treatment is rooted deep in our mechanistic understanding of early metastatic evolution and our capability to stop metastatic progression before aggressive outgrowth occurs. Using single cell transcriptome sequencing and multiplexed single cell deep-tissue imaging, we aim to trace and analyze the lineage dynamics of a single cancer cell within its specific metastatic microenvironment from the initial moment of metastatic colonization. The conceptual advances validated from this study will serve as a blueprint for future adjuvant therapies targeting early metastatic evolution, providing more effective cancer treatments.",(PQD-3)

"Stimulated Raman imaging for label-free histology to guide brain tumor surgery ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of brain tumor surgery is to maximize removal of tumor without causing permanent neurologic deficits. Studies have shown that outcomes for patients depend strongly on these two variables. However, this is difficult because tumor tissue is often indistinguishable from healthy tissue in the operating room. Preoperative and intraoperative MRI through neuronavigation can be used to guide brain tumor surgery, but it is not able to accurately delineate the tumor margin due to the brain deformation and brain shift during surgery. H&E staining as the current gold standard is often performed intraoperatively for preliminary diagnosis, but it is not used to guide extent of resection routinely due to the limitations including tissue artifacts, labor-intensiveness, and time delay. Fluorescence guided surgery is beginning to be used to guided brain tumor surgery, but is generally not useful for low grade gliomas, the tumors which pose the greatest challenge and opportunity to extend survival and improve quality of life. Stimulated Raman imaging (SRI) has been used for rapid label-free biomolecular mapping in live tissue. Recently we have developed a novel approach with SRI to image nucleic acids, together with protein and lipids. Visualization of nucleic acids allows definition of nuclear morphology and chromatin structures, thereby enabling pathologic evaluation of clinically relevant cellular morphology, providing almost equivalent information to H&E staining. The goal of this translational research is to establish the methodology and practice for label-free histopathology with SRI for brain tumor diagnosis, and eventually develop it into a clinical device for ambient SR imaging of fresh tissue in the operating room in real time If the aims are achieved, this project will greatly improve the current clinical practice of brain tumor surgery by providing real time tissue diagnosis for more precise control of the extent of resection and preservation of neurologic function. Furthermore, this approach may be of value for all oncologic surgeries and other clinical pathology such as fine needle biopsies and bone marrow biopsy. The candidate for this award Dr. Fake Lu is a postdoctoral research fellow at Brigham and Women's Hospital. Dr. Lu has extensive experience and expertise in biophotonics and biomedical optics, specialized in system innovations of stimulated Raman microscopy and multiphoton microscopy for biomedical applications. BWH is an international leader in basic, clinical and translational research on human diseases, and has established multiple research programs to promote the work and professional career development of young investigators. BWH is also home to the National Center for Image Guided Therapy (P41) and the Advanced Multi-modality Image Guided operating suite (AMIGO) infrastructure which will greatly support to proposed research. Dr. Lu's long term research goal is to develop and apply advanced biophysical and optical technologies and devices to improve understanding, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases, such as cancers, for better health care. His long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator working at the frontier of translational research. The immediate objectives for the five-year award period is to 1) establish and evaluate label-free histopathology SRI for brain tumor diagnosis, 2) to demonstrate ambient imaging of surgically removed fresh tissue for diagnosis of brain tumors for real time guidance of neurosurgical resection, 3) to develop a novel stimulated Raman microscopy to collect full spectral data in parallel for label-free histopathology, as well as lipid biomarker screening, 4) t develop a computer algorithm for SR image analysis to realize automatic brain tumor diagnosis, and 5) finally by integrating the instrument and software to build and demonstrate a prototype of a clinical device for guiding neurosurgical resection of brain tumors. This device could also be used for other oncologic surgeries and will have great potential for commercialization. To conduct the proposed research, in addition to further develop his current strengths in biophotonics, stimulated Raman microscopy, and nonlinear optical microscopy, Dr. Lu plans to receive more education and training to enrich and expand his knowledge and expertise in the following four areas: 1) to receive critical training in conducting translational research, 2) to enrich his knowledge and deepen his understanding in brain tumor biology and medicine, 3) to learn skills in developing computer algorithms for SR image analysis, and 4) to prepare for writing grant applications and seeking funding independently. Dr. Lu will participate in 12 formal courses selected from those offered by Harvard Catalyst and Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. He will attend weekly seminars at BWH and Harvard University, seminar series on biomedical image analysis organized by MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. He will also attend one or two annual conferences per year to present his work for peer discussion. A strong mentoring team was organized to provide solid support to the proposed research and Dr. Lu's career development, including Dr. Alexandra Golby in neurosurgery at BWH, Prof. X. Sunney Xie in coherent Raman microscopy at Harvard, Prof. Nathalie Agar in molecular cancer diagnosis at BWH, Prof. Polina Golland in computer-based image analysis at MIT, and Dr. Sandro Santagata in neuropathology at BWH. This career development award will provide Dr. Lu with the training and skills needed to transition into an independent investigator in translational research.

"Quantifying Multiscale Competitive Landscapes of Clonal Diversity in Glioblastoma ABSTRACT  Glioblastoma (GBM) exhibits profound intratumoral molecular heterogeneity that contributes to treatment resistance and poor survival. Specifically, each tumor comprises multiple molecularly-distinct subpopulations with different treatment sensitivities. This heterogeneity not only portends the pre-existence of resistant molecular subpopulations, but also the communications between neighboring subpopulations that further modulate tumorigenicity and resistance. In fact, a minority tumor subpopulation with EGFRvIII mutation has been shown to potentiate a majority subpopulation with wild-type EGFR to increase tumor growth, cell survival, and drug resistance. This type of cooperativity presents clear implications for improving GBM treatment. Yet compared to other tumor types, the interactions in GBM remain critically understudied. A significant barrier to studying the interactions between molecularly-distinct subpopulations is the challenge of tissue sampling in GBM. In particular, contrast-enhanced MRI (CE-MRI) routinely guides surgical biopsy and resection of the MRI enhancing core, but fails to address the diverse subpopulations of the surrounding non-enhancing parenchyma (so called “brain around tumor” or BAT). These unresected residual subpopulations in BAT represent the main contributors to tumor recurrence, which can exhibit different therapeutic targets (and interactions) compared with enhancing biopsies. To address the limitations of tissue sampling, imaging techniques can help quantitatively characterize tumors in their entirety, including unresected BAT regions. Our group has used multi-parametric MRI and image-guided biopsies to develop and validate machine-learning (ML) models of intratumoral genomic heterogeneity, with particular focus on the BAT zone. In Aim 1, will we collect and molecularly profile a large set of image-recorded stereotactic biopsies in primary GBM patients to quantify the diversity of molecularly-distinct subpopulations, as well as their phenotypic niches, throughout the BAT zone. We will assess local heterogeneity at the biopsy level and also co-localize regional patterns and rates of recurrence on serial MRI. In Aim 2, we will use these biopsies and spatially matched MRI metrics to refine our existing ML predictive models. We will use these ML models to co- localize spatial patterns of molecularly-distinct subpopulations (and their phenotypic niches) to quantify their risk of regional recurrence. In Aim 3, we will functionally validate the subpopulation interactions observed in Aims 1 and 2 using patient derived xenograft (PDX) models. We will also validate these interactions in human GBM using a subset of spatially matched biopsies from primary and recurrent tumors in the same patients. This proposal leverages our unique expertise in image-guided tissue analysis and MRI-based computational modeling to study the diversity of molecularly-distinct subpopulations and the evolving competitive landscapes in human GBM. This work will help risk stratify patients in future targeted clinical drug trials and should also facilitate new strategies (e.g., adaptive therapy) to exploit subpopulation co-dependency for therapeutic benefit. PROJECT NARRATIVE  We propose here a novel strategy that identifies the potential molecular underpinnings of treatment resistance within the zone where tumor almost always recurs. By developing image-based models that quantify the diversity of molecularly-distinct subpopulations (and their interactions) within individual tumors, the proposed work will improve image-based diagnosis and therapeutic strategies in the paradigm of individualized oncology.",Quantifying Multiscale Competitive Landscapes of Clonal Diversity in Glioblastoma,9564081,U01CA220378,"['Behavior ', '

"Quantitative Multimodal Image Guidance for Improved Liver Cancer Treatment Project Summary/Abstract  Liver cancer is the second most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide and is likely to grow even more in the next decade given the epidemic levels of hepatitis B and C and the emergence of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) due to obesity in the US. Most liver cancer patients present with disease that cannot be treated surgically. Minimally invasive, catheter-based, intra-arterial therapies such as TACE (transarterial chemoembolization) have become the mainstay therapy and are included in all treatment guidelines because of their ability to achieve local tumor control and extend survival. TACE overcomes the problem of chemoresistance in cancer cells by delivering high dose chemotherapy through image guidance and embolization of the tumor feeding blood vessel. TACE most commonly uses an oily medium (Lipiodol) as a radiopaque drug delivery mate- rial by creating an emulsion between drugs and oil. The recent introduction of drug-eluting bead (DEB) technol- ogy provides an opportunity to achieve the goal of controlled and sustainable drug release to tumors, which was not possible with oily TACE. Although TACE clearly improves patient survival, limitations still exist – speciﬁcally, incomplete treatment and tumor recurrence – attributed to the stimulation of angiogenesis. Most of these issues can be addressed with a greater understanding of the tumor microenvironment, in particular the relationship that exists between hypoxia, acidosis and angiogenesis. In fact, the development of imaging biomarkers reﬂecting changes within the tumor microenvironment is increasingly being pursued to individualize cancer therapies and increase their potency. Yet, our ability to characterize the tumor microenvironment using current imaging tech- nology is extremely limited. TACE has had to rely on 2D X-ray angiography until recently when the emergence of intra-procedural dual phase cone beam CT (DP-CBCT) contributed signiﬁcantly to improving tumor visualization, microcatheter guidance, and treatment endpoint. It is precisely through the longstanding close partnership be- tween Philips, Johns Hopkins and now Yale that this technology was optimized and became broadly accepted as the new standard of practice for TACE, demonstrating the prompt successful translation of research ﬁndings to clinical practice. However, the targeting of tumors and assessment of outcomes continues to be limited, relying on qualitative/semi-quantitative enhancement patterns from DP-CBCT and single parameter MR images. The unique partnership between Yale & Philips provides innovative technology that will directly enhance the role of image-guided intervention and address this unmet need by quantitatively characterizing the tumor microenvi- ronment and tumor tissue composition in order to maximize treatment potency and improve outcomes. We will integrate advanced, multiparameter MR with active CBCT imaging and create valuable biomarkers derived from novel machine learning methods for image and data analysis. By providing essential, quantitative information, drug delivery to tumors can be maximized because it will be based on inherent tumor properties. In the same way, the assessment of therapy will be much more precise and therefore useful to identify responders. Project Narrative This grant is aimed at enhancing our ability to deliver minimally invasive catheter-based treatments for liver cancer using drug delivery platforms which simultaneously embolize the tumor vasculature and locally deliver chemotherapy agents, and assess their efﬁcacy. At the core of the effort is the development, evaluation and translation to clinical practice of advanced imaging and analysis methods to characterize the tumor microen- vironment and derive feature information from novel multiparameter, multimodal images to classify tissue and quantify the response to therapy. The resulting methodology will lead to improved patient care through more precise delivery and more accurate response assessment.",Quantitative Multimodal Image Guidance for Improved Liver Cancer

"Bronchoscope-guided microwave ablation of early-stage lung tumors PROJECT SUMMARY In this Industry-Academic partnership R01 research plan, we propose the development, optimization, and pilot first-in-human evaluation of a bronchoscope-guided microwave ablation (MWA) system for rapid and conformal thermal ablation of early stage pulmonary tumors. Minimally-invasive, image- guided MWA is a cost-effective treatment for thermal destruction of unresectable tumors in the liver, lung, kidney, and other organs. Current MWA technology for pulmonary tumors is limited to a percutaneous approach, which precludes treatment of central tumors and has a high associated risk of pneumothorax. Furthermore, limited intra-procedural feedback and lack of guidance and treatment planning tools places a substantial burden on the physician to precisely position applicators and ensure adequate ablation of the target, while limiting damage to non-targets. Virtual bronchoscopy and navigation, pioneered by Broncus Medical (industrial partner), affords accurate, minimally-invasive access to early-stage pulmonary tumors, with minimal risk of pneumothorax, compared to a percutaneous approach. The team at Kansas State University (academic partner) will develop optimized flexible microwave applicators for delivering localized thermal ablation to pulmonary tumors via a bronchoscopic approach. The proposed MWA devices include antennas with directional control of microwave power deposition for precise ablation of small targets, and will be extensively evaluated with computational models and experimentally, on the benchtop, and in an in vivo animal model. Transient changes in antenna impedance matching will be exploited as a feedback parameter for assessing ablation progress. A machine-learning based treatment planning and guidance platform will be developed and integrated with Broncus’ Archimedes planning and virtual bronchoscopy platform to guide the selection of optimal treatment parameters. The integrated system will be translated for first-in- human studies to evaluate the feasibility and safety of bronchoscopically delivering MWA for targeting pulmonary tumors (subaward with University of British Columbia, through Broncus Medical). The central hypothesis of this research is that a bronchoscopic MWA system integrating: (1) applicators with directional control of ablation profiles; (2) impedance-based intra-procedural feedback; and (3) bronchoscopic guidance and treatment planning tools, will afford the safe and effective treatment of localized early-stage pulmonary tumors. The proposed research will lead to the development of an integrated system for bronchoscopic ablation of pulmonary tumors, and its pilot feasibility assessment in human patients. If successful, this work will considerably expand the range of patients with lung tumors that can be treated with a cost-effective, minimally-invasive approach. PROJECT NARRATIVE Microwave ablation (MWA) is a minimally invasive treatment option for thermal destruction of tumors, that is in clinical use for treating tumors in the lung with a percutaneous approach. If successful, this research will lead to the development and first-in-human evaluation of MWA devices that can be delivered through a bronchoscope, and integrated with an image-guidance and treatment planning platform.",Bronchoscope-guided microwave ablation of early-stage lung tumors,9470702,R01CA218357,"['Animals ', ' British Columbia ', ' Bronchoscopy ', ' Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma ', ' nonsmall cell lung cancer ', ' Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ', ' NSCLC - Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ', ' NSCLC ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Environment ', ' Feedback ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Heating ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Industrialization ', ' Industry ', ' Kansas ', ' Kidney ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' hepatic body system ', ' Lung ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Lung diseases ', ' lung disorder ', ' disorder of the lung ', ' disease of the lung ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Lung Neoplasms ', ' Pulmonary Neoplasms ', ' Lung Tumor ', ' microwave electromagnetic radiation ', ' microwave radiation ', ' Microwaves ', ' Microwave Electromagnetic ', ' Nodule ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Pneumothorax ', ' pneumothorax disorder ', ' Pulmonary Emphysema ', ' emphysematous ', ' Emphysema ', ' Nonionizing Radiation ', ' Radiation-Non-Ionizing Total ', ' Nonionizing Electromagnetic Radiation ', ' Non-Ionizing Radiation ', ' Non-Ionizing Electromagnetic Radiation ', ' Radiation therapy ', ' treatment with radiation ', ' radio-therapy ', ' radiation treatment ', ' Radiotherapy ', ' Radiotherapeutics ', ' Research ', ' Research Support ', ' Respiratory physiology ', ' respiratory function ', ' lung function ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Impedance ', ' Electrical Impedance ', ' electric impedance ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' Bronchoscopes ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Interstitial Lung Diseases ', ' Thermal Destruction ', ' Incineration ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' Deposition ', ' Deposit ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Ablation ', ' experience ', ' animal data ', ' lung preservation ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' treatment planning ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Toxicities ', ' Thermal Ablation Therapy ', ' thermal tumor ablation ', ' thermal ablation ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Modality ', ' Devices ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' in vivo ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research ', ' Unresectable ', ' Monitor ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' cost ', ' virtual ', ' computerized ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Coupled ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' tumor ', ' minimally invasive ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' minimal risk ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' microwave ablation ', ' image guidance ', ' image guided ', ' tumor ablation ', ' safety and feasibility ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' first in man ', ' first-in-human ', ' optimal therapies ', ' optimal treatments ', ' real time monitoring ', ' ']",NCI,KANSAS STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,321353,KS-01,0.11640456408802437
"An Academic-Industry Partnership to Advance Functional Genomics for Personalized Oncology. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Oregon Health & Science University and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center have worked over the past decade to develop ex vivo drug profiling to guide a rationale decision-making in assigning drugs to cancer patients, thereby improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs. A number of recent breakthroughs, many developed through our partnership, have dramatically improved on nearly all aspects of ex vivo drug testing. Our work to date has led to numerous compassionate-use cases as well as new investigator initiated clinical trials. Recognizing the broad utility for a clinic-friendly ex vivo drug sensitivity platform, we set up a commercial entity, SEngine Precision Medicine, whose mission is to provide functional testing of patient derived tumor cells for research, clinical studies, and drug development. Here we seek to move beyond proof of concept in the assay toward wider adoption by cancer research centers, community hospitals, and individual users. We will benchmark the assay’s predictive performance in both “N of 1” settings and in prospective observational studies, and use this baseline performance to drive the development of methods to further improve its predictive value. We will continue to optimize drug selection by integrating ex vivo drug testing with patient specific genomic profiling and clinical data. In parallel, we will develop a reporting system, based upon requirements analysis, for potential end users such as clinicians and academic research centers. OHSU will provide expertise in precision medicine for AML, functional testing of primary leukemia cells, and clinical trials and will assist with assay optimization. FHCRC will provide expertise in functional testing of cells derived from solid tumors, focusing first on breast cancer, cancer genomics, and clinical trials; and will assist with assay optimization and benchmarking. SEngine will develop CLIA certified assays, optimize sample analysis workflows, and develop a reporting system for end users. All three sites will work together to demonstrate inter-institutional proficiency of the assays. At least five additional academic centers have agreed to provide patient derived tumor cells for this project and we anticipate this number will increase during the granting period. The partnering institutions will also provide essential feedback for our performance and reporting system. Our end goals for this project are to produce a refined functional genomic platform based on ex vivo drug screens, a user-friendly reporting interface, and adoption of the technology in the clinical care decision-making process. PROJECT NARRATIVE The ability to provide effective therapy recommendations to cancer patients is limited by our capacity to predict which drugs will work for a given patient. Our platform overcomes this limitation by testing a set of available anti- cancer drugs on tumor cells cultured directly from cancer patients. Through an extensive academic/industry partnership, we propose to refine and benchmark this platform, improve its predictive power, and provide a user- friendly reporting interface to facilitate its adoption by cancer care providers.  ",An Academic-Industry Partnership to Advance Functional Genomics for Personalized Oncology.,9446810,R01CA214428,"['Adoption ', ' Antineoplastic Agents ', ' anticancer drug ', ' anticancer agent ', ' anti-cancer drug ', ' Tumor-Specific Treatment Agents ', ' Neoplastic Disease Chemotherapeutic Agents ', ' Cancer Drug ', ' Antineoplastics ', ' Antineoplastic Drugs ', ' Anti-Cancer Agents ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Certification ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Decision Making ', ' Designer Drugs ', ' Customized Drugs ', ' Drug Combinations ', ' Drug Industry ', ' Pharmaceutical Industry ', ' Pharmaceutic Industry ', ' Drug resistance ', ' resistant to Drug ', ' resistance to Drug ', ' drug resistant ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Economics ', ' Feedback ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Community Hospitals ', ' leukemia ', ' Acute Myelocytic Leukemia ', ' acute myeloid leukemia ', ' acute granulocytic leukemia ', ' Acute Myelogenous Leukemia ', ' Acute Myeloblastic Leukemia ', ' AML -

"Precision lung cancer therapy design through multiplexed adapter measurement Project Summary Combination therapy holds considerable promise for overcoming intrinsic and acquired resistance to targeted therapies but will rely on our ability to precisely identify the best drug combination for particular tumors. While immense focus exists on using genomic information to direct therapeutic approach, many resistance mechanisms do not rely on genetic changes and, in fact, can arise from entirely tumor-extrinsic factors within the microenvironment. For example, though the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) AXL is widely implicated in resistance to targeted therapies such as those directed against EGFR, its regulation by phosphatidylserine, as opposed to mutation, amplification or autocrine ligand, make identifying the tumors that will respond to AXL- targeted therapy especially challenging.  We propose to study both downstream and receptor-proximal signaling during bypass resistance mediated by AXL, and then across a wider panel of RTKs. Integrating these measurements with quantitative modeling will identify the connectivity between receptors, interacting adapters, and downstream signaling events, thereby defining the essential set of signaling network changes required for tumor cell survival in response to targeted therapeutics. We will then apply this understanding by measuring RTK-adapter interaction using proximity ligation to predict the RTKs driving bypass resistance and test these predictions in a panel of patient-derived xenograft tumors.  This work will considerably improve our ability to identify effective drug combinations by (a) developing a mechanism-based assay for identifying which among many RTKs tumor cells are relying upon for survival, (b) improving our basic understanding of exactly how network-level bypass resistance arises due to activation of non-targeted RTKs both at the receptor-proximal and downstream signaling layer, and (c) expanding our understanding of the RTK AXL with links to resistance, tumor spread, and immune avoidance. Project Narrative The proposed research is of immediate relevance to the public health mission of the NIH as it will considerably improve our understanding of resistance to targeted lung cancer therapies, which currently greatly limits their efficacy. This will focus development of new targeted drugs to overcome resistance, and optimize the application of therapy combinations for individual patients.",Precision lung cancer therapy design through multiplexed adapter measurement,9571234,U01CA215709,"['inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Cell Line ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Survival ', ' Cell Viability ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Combined Modality Therapy ', ' multimodality therapy ', ' combined treatment ', ' combined modality treatment ', ' combination therapy ', ' Multimodality Treatment ', ' Multimodal Treatment ', ' Multimodal Therapy ', ' Drug Combinations ', ' Elements ', ' Ligands ', ' Ligation ', ' Closure by Ligation ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Statistical Models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Patients ', ' Phosphatidylserines ', ' Serine Phosphoglycerides ', ' Phosphorylation ', ' Protein Phosphorylation ', ' Proteins ', ' Public Health ', ' Complement Receptor ', ' Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor ', ' proto-oncogene protein c-erbB-1 ', ' erbBl ', ' erbB-1 Proto-Oncogene Protein ', ' erbB-1 ', ' c-erbB-1 Protein ', ' c-erbB-1 ', ' Urogastrone Receptor ', ' Transforming Growth Factor alpha Receptor ', ' TGF-alpha Receptor ', ' HER1 ', ' Epidermal Growth Factor-Urogastrone Receptors ', ' Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinase ', ' Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Kinase ', ' ERBB Protein ', ' EGFR ', ' EGF Receptor ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' axl receptor tyrosine kinase ', ' ufo receptor ', ' UFO oncogene protein ', ' Tyrosine-Protein Kinase Receptor UFO ', ' AXL Protein ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Tyrosine Kinase Receptors ', ' Tyrosine Kinase Linked Receptors ', ' Transmembrane Receptor Protein Tyrosine Kinase ', ' Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Gene ', ' PTK Receptors ', ' Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases ', ' Link ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' Measurement ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Immune ', ' Immunes ', ' Event ', ' Xenograft procedure ', ' xeno-transplantation ', ' xeno-transplant ', ' Xenotransplantation ', ' Xenograft ', ' Heterologous Transplantation ', ' Heterograft ', ' autocrine ', ' Autocrine Systems ', ' mutant ', ' neoplastic cell ', ' Tumor Cell ', ' receptor ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' receptor expression ', ' Bypass ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Genomics ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Adaptor Signaling Protein ', ' adapter protein ', ' Adaptor Signaling Protein Gene ', ' Adaptor Protein Gene ', ' Adaptor Protein ', ' RIPK1 gene ', ' Receptor-Interacting Serine/Threonine Kinase 1 ', ' Receptor-Interacting Protein ', ' RIPK1 ', ' RIP1 ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Receptor Activation ', ' in vivo ', ' resistant mechanism ', ' resistance mechanism ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' treatment resistance ', ' therapeutic resistance ', ' resistant to therapy ', ' resistance to therapy ', ' therapy resistant ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' tumor xenograft ', ' resistant ', ' Resistance ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' tumor ', ' novel therapy target ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' novel pharmacotherapy target ', ' novel druggable target ', ' novel drug target ', ' new therapy target ', ' new pharmacotherapy target ', ' new druggable target ', ' new drug target ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' targeted therapy ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted treatment ', ' individual patient ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,U01,2018,550445,CA-33,0.09113684963107378
"Integrative framework for identifying dysregulated mechanisms in the tumor-immune microenvironment Project Summary/Abstract Current cancer therapies provide targeted treatments attacking specific cells, however, tumor cells are heterogeneous and evolving. To develop personalized treatments, we need to understand the composition of cell types in the tumor and the disrupted regulatory mechanisms that lead to cancer stem cells (CSCs). CSCs are resistant to standard therapies and have the ability to form new tumors leading to relapse and metastasis. Immunotherapies harnessing the immune system can be particularly successful in targeting CSCs, however, their mechanisms of action are not well understood. I hypothesize that an unbiased study of the complex tumor microenvironment containing elusive resistant CSCs and interacting immune populations can be achieved with high-dimensional genome-wide data, such as state-of-the-art single-cell resolution transcriptional integrated with epigenetic measurements, using Bayesian statistical tools that are ideal for distinguishing technical noise from biological heterogeneity and integrating different data types. I capitalize on our previous work in collaboration with the Alexander Rudensky Lab on characterizing immune cell populations in breast cancer tumors, using a computational method we developed in the Dana Pe’er Lab for clustering cells in single-cell transcriptomic data while simultaneously normalizing cells and correcting batch effects. In my PhD work, I showed the power of incorporating epigenetic data in inferring regulatory programs. Hence, in my K99 mentored phase, I aim to develop a computational framework for integrating epigenetic data with single-cell transcriptomic data to infer leukemic stem cells and dysregulated mechanisms in Acute Myeloid Leukemia in collaboration with Ross Levine (Aim 1). I have chosen AML as it involves enrichment of epigenetic mutations and the normal hematopoiesis system is well-characterized and would serve as a reference. As an independent investigator in the R00 phase, I will extend this framework to infer CSCs and dysregulations in the tumor as well as composition of immune cells and their reprogramming in under-characterized solid tumors, in collaboration with Benjamin Neel and others in my future institute (Aim 2). I then aim to use this toolbox to study the impact of immunotherapy treatments on the tumor-immune microenvironment in collaboration with Catherine Wu and my future institute (Aim 3). We expect that our results lead to insights into regulatory mechanisms that are disrupted in cancer and drive heterogeneous populations. We would also infer mechanisms of action of immunotherapies in the tumor-immune microenvironment. This proposal describes a training plan to advance my career to an independent investigator at the interface of machine learning and cancer biology. During the K99 phase, I will be supported by an outstanding and interdisciplinary team of advisors and collaborators with expertise in all aspects of the proposed research.

Project Narrative  Cancer treatments lead to favorable outcomes only in a subset of patients due to significant heterogeneity in tumor cells. To develop treatments tailored to each patient and the composition of cell types in each tumor, we need to characterize the complex populations of tumor cells and their dysregulated mechanisms.

"Multi-parametric 4-D Imaging Biomarkers for Neoadjuvant Treatment Response ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Imaging plays a critical role in evaluating tumor response to treatment; however the currently used methods remain significantly limited. For example, standards such as the RECIST are subjective and cannot be used to adequately characterize irregular lesions; tumor volume measures alone do not account for detailed structural changes; and features from selected tumor regions, such as ""hot-spot"" peak-enhancement, do not capture information from the entire tumor. As such, current approaches fall short of capturing the multi-faceted effects of treatment, including phenotypic tumor heterogeneity and its longitudinal change during treatment, which is increasingly recognized as an important predictive indicator. To date, few studies have explored using richer imaging descriptors, which could result in more powerful predictive markers. Moreover, fewer have attempted to combine multi-modal biomarkers, such as imaging with histopathologic and molecular markers, to develop enhanced predictive models for specific tumor sub-types and individual patients. We propose to develop advanced computational tools that will enable to i) extract novel multi-parametric imaging signatures and ii) accurately characterize their longitudinal patterns of change during neoadjuvant treatment via deformable image registration. Our approach is thus geared towards knowledge discovery, for determining which imaging parameters have the highest predictive value out of many possible ways to quantify information provided by imaging. In SA1 we will develop robust 4D deformable image registration methods, based on principles of mutual saliency, for estimating transformations that will enable us to robustly register serial imaging scans and obtain anatomically precise spatio-temporal parametric maps of longitudinal tissue effects induced by treatment. In SA2 we will analyze whole-tumor and normal tissue effects by performing multi- parametric feature extraction, including a rich set of morphologic, textural, kinetic and parenchymal tissue descriptors, which in conjunction to registration will allow us to comprehensively capture the dynamically evolving imaging phenotype during treatment. In SA3 we will test our method in a major breast imaging study, the I-SPY 1/ACRIN 6657 trial. We will apply machine learning tools to identify high-dimensional associations of imaging patterns, in conjunction to histopathologic tumor subtyping, that can best predict pathologic complete response (pCR) and 5-year disease free survival (DFS). In SA4 we will independently test our models with the I-SPY 2/ACRIN 6698 trial, where we will also evaluate the robustness of our features to a diverse range of treatments. Our methods hold the promise to shift the current paradigm in personalizing neoadjuvant treatment by 1) improving the current standards of imaging-based assessment and 2) introducing new imaging biomarkers that can be of higher value as early predictors of treatment response and survival. Our tools will be shared as open-source software via NIH/NCI tool registries and open-challenge activities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Pattern analysis and machine learning methods are powerful knowledge discovery tools that can be very effective in identifying complex multi-parametric patterns from a diverse set of imaging and non-imaging biomarkers that can best predict treatment response and outcome. Our method will leverage the richness of available data to point to new imaging biomarkers that are better early predictors of response, enabling personalized treatment decisions for women undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer.",Multi-parametric 4-D Imaging Biomarkers for Neoadjuvant Treatment Response,9440279,R01CA197000,"['Anatomy ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences

"QUANTITATIVE IMAGE MODELING FOR BRAIN TUMOR ANALYSIS AND TRACKING MRI images have been used for a wide variety of medical applications for a long time because they are safe and highly sensitive at detecting of tissue abnormalities that indicate cancer. MRI is generated by measuring the response of tissue components to a magnetic field. Also, based on the published statistics, brain tumor is one of the most common causes of death and early detection and monitoring is crucial for treatment. Literature and market review suggests that although extensive research exists on brain tumor detection using MRI images, MRI–based systems designed for brain tumor detection that have ultimate clinical value and use are lacking. Accordingly, we propose a new software technology that effectively detect, segment, classify and monitor brain tumor in MRI images. There have been extensive efforts on brain tumor detection in MR images because early detection has been always crucial for success of treatment. For ongoing work in our parent RO1 grant we are developing new machine learning and image analysis methods that for automatic detection and segmentation of brain tumor in MRI images, which is expected to help patients to have a much better chance of successful treatment.

"Characterization of the functions of one-carbon metabolism across human cancers Project Summary/Abstract Cancerous cells reprogram their metabolism to accommodate their needs. A deep understanding of this metabolic reprograming can lead to novel and promising routes toward cancer treatment. Different human cancers differ with respect to aspects of their metabolic rewiring, however a profound knowledge in this field is lacking. The main goal of my thesis project is to characterize the ways in which one-carbon metabolism — a metabolic pathway highly altered in cancer— is utilized by different human cancers and elucidate its consequences on downstream processes such as epigenetics and biosynthesis. Using information in genomic profiles of individual tumors, I build computational models to infer metabolic landscapes, assess their implications in patient survival, and predict response to chemotherapy. By studying one-carbon metabolites in the human serum, I confirm the relevance of theses findings in human contexts and suggest potentials for dietary intervention approaches. In aim 1, I characterize the usage of serine through one-carbon metabolism across human cancers. I performed flux analysis using gene expression profiles of hundreds of human tumors, followed by experimental validation using metabolomics approaches. In aim 2, I identify the determinants of human serum methionine. Diet records, serum metabolomics, and clinical data from a cohort of human subjects were incorporated into computational models. The determinants of variability in serum methionine were then quantified, suggesting a mechanism for regulation of cellular epigenetics by the diet. In aim 3, I determine the sources of variation in DNA methylation across human cancers and the contribution of metabolism. I integrated molecular and clinical profiles of thousands of human tumors from the TCGA into machine-learning algorithms to identify their association with DNA methylation. A major contribution from one-carbon metabolism in regulating DNA methylation status in tumors was found. In aim 4, I predict response to anti-metabolic chemotherapies based on tumor genomics. I plan to translate my previous findings into clinical discoveries. To this end, I will demonstrate how tumor profiles can be used to model patient survival, predict response to chemotherapy, and move toward precision medicine. Narrative Alteration in cellular metabolism is one the hallmarks of cancer. This project aims to elucidate the consequences of these alterations in cancer and reveal how different human cancers differ with respect to their metabolism.

"Clinical Translation of Stimulated Raman Histology Accurate intraoperative tissue diagnosis is central to medical decision making during brain tumor surgery. Existing intraoperative histologic techniques deplete scant tissue biopsies, introduce freezing artifacts, and rely on highly- skilled technicians and neuropathologists working in dedicated surgical pathology laboratories to produce and interpret slides2. In addition, the number of centers where brain tumor surgery is performed far exceeds the number of board-certified neuropathologists, eliminating the possibility for expert consultation in many cases. Even in the most advanced, well-staffed hospitals, turnaround time for intraoperative pathology poses a major barrier for the efficient delivery of surgical care, highlighting the need for an improved system for rapid diagnosis. Stimulated Raman histology (SRH) creates high-resolution digital microscopic images of unprocessed tissue specimens in a fraction of the time of conventional techniques and eliminates reliance on a frozen section laboratory for sectioning, staining, mounting and reviewing slides. While SRH has been shown to reveal key diagnostic histologic features in brain tumor specimens5-7, major technical hurdles related to laser safety and performance have hindered its clinical translation. The existing academic-industrial partnership between established collaborators has resulted in the development and initial validation of a clinically-compatible SRH microscope in a patient care setting (Nature Biomedical Engineering 1:0027, 2017). We have demonstrated that SRH has diagnostic value comparable to conventional histologic techniques and that SRH images are well-suited for interpretation via an automated machine learning algorithm. The proposed research program represents a multi-disciplinary (neurosurgery, neuropathology, biostatistics, computer science and medical device manufacturing) academic-industry partnership to accelerate the development of an SRH imager for use during brain tumor surgery. The overall goal of the partnership is to create pathways for online collaboration between surgeons and pathologists using the SRH imager, provide strong evidence for the utility of SRH in the setting of a prospective randomized controlled trial and to enhance our capabilities for automated intraoperative diagnosis employing state-of the-art image classification methods including convolutional neural networks. Once completed, this research program will improve the care of brain tumor patients by streamlining the process for intraoperative diagnosis. It will also create a pathway for remote and automated diagnosis, extending expertise in neuropathology to more centers caring for brain tumor patients. SRH technology combined with algorithms for automated intraoperative diagnosis create the possibility of advancing the larger field of surgical oncology where histologic information is essential for making surgical decisions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Existing techniques for creating histologic images of tissue during surgery are time-consuming, prone to error, may complicate diagnosis and surgical-decision making. We have developed an optical imaging technology which streamlines tissue diagnosis during surgery, enabling a uniform workflow that will improve the care of cancer patients.

"Integrating Radiomics into S0819 and Lung-MAP, Biomarker Driven Clinical Trials for Lung Cancer The goal of this research is to clinically translate software tools we developed through the Quantitative Imaging Network and validate their ability to assess the response of cancer in clinical trials. Current RECIST response criteria are inadequate to detect tumor changes in targeted molecular therapy and immunotherapies, two of the most promising avenues for drug discovery. We hypothesize that innovative volumetric and radiomics signatures of response and progression, identified using our quantitative CT imaging tools, can be integrated into clinical trial workflow to meet the urgent need for alternatives to RECIST criteria. Two large multi-site trials present a unique opportunity to test this hypothesis in one disease treated with multiple therapeutic options driven by tissue biomarkers. S0819 is a completed Phase III trial with 1300+ patients and Lung- MAP (S1400) is an ongoing first-of-its-kind Phase II/III model projected to enroll up to 5,000 patients using a multi-drug, targeted screening approach to match patients with sub-studies testing investigational treatments based on their unique tumor profiles. Aim 1 tests whether change in tumor volume over time, measured by our advanced volumetric segmentation algorithms, outperforms unidimensional RECIST 1.1 response criteria. Aim 2 correlates genomic mutations identified in S0819 and Lung-MAP with radiomics signatures constructed by our machine learning models, with the goal of developing a non-invasive, easily repeatable virtual biopsy through CT imaging. Aim 3 validates the prediction of clinical outcomes using early biomarkers of response and progression based on quantitative CT-based radiomic features, hypothesized to outperform both RECIST and volumetrics alone across therapeutic options including chemotherapies, targeted molecular agents, and immune checkpoint blockade. Our work has substantial health significance because validation of volume and radiomic changes as early biomarkers of response or progression will guide clinical trials for drug discovery and help match patients to personalized treatment. Response criteria developed through this study will be widely applicable to clinical practice because CT is the most common cancer imaging modality and the quantitative image analysis tools can easily be incorporated into existing popular imaging platforms and clinical workflow, reducing the time required by radiologists. Data from this project, including anonymized imaging data (CT for all patients and PET for a large subset), clinical meta- data, and lesion mark-ups by independent radiologists, will be shared for use by other researchers through the TCGA Cancer Imaging Archive, continuing an extensive history of data sharing by this team. This work will improve drug discovery for promising new classes of therapies by creating innovative response criteria based on volumetric and radiomics signatures developed with prior support by the QIN and now validated in two large multi-site clinical trials studying multiple therapeutic options in the most important histologic types of lung cancer and most commonly used imaging modality, CT. Results are expected to be applied to other tumor types and help match patients to the treatment that works best for them.","Integrating Radiomics into S0819 and Lung-MAP, Biomarker Driven Clinical

"Engineering personalized micro-tumor ecosystems Abstract Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in the United States, accounting for near 1 in every 4 deaths. However, despite the recent development of subtype-specific personalized therapy based on achievements in the fields of molecular and genetic profiling, many cancer treatments still have low efficacy which mostly arise from the limited ability to predict the patient tumor responses to therapeutic agents. The major reason that current therapeutics often cannot translate into a successful clinical outcomes is because of the complex tumor microenvironment and heterogeneity that limit the predictive power of the biomarker-guided strategies for chemotherapy. Therefore, the successful engineering of personalized three-dimensional (3D) tumor ecosystem that can recapitulate the tumor microenvironment and heterogeneity in vitro is strongly desired to accurately predict patients’ responses to anti-cancer drugs and thus further improve patient outcome. Here we propose to develop a personalized breast-cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip platform for personalized screening of cancer chemotherapeutics with high accuracy by utilizing patient-derived tumor explant, defined tumor grade-matched biomaterial matrices and autologous patient serum to mimic patient-specific tumor hallmarks. The proposed cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip will also be tightly regulated under physiological fluid dynamics. In this project, we have hypothesized that 1) the use of tumor explant will embrace the critical components of the tumor heterogeneity of the patient, 2) the combination of defined tumor grade-matched matrix, autologous patient serum, and a microfluidic bioreactor will prevent the phenotype alteration of the tumor explant, and 3) the integration of a machine-learning algorithm with the cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip platform will provide more accurate, unbiased prediction of the patient responses to chemotherapeutics based on the data gathered from the engineered tumor model. Our preliminary results show that the combination of tumor explant culture and tumor-derived matrix constituents had predicted therapeutic responses with 100% sensitivity. Our preliminary results show high specificity throughout a range of cancers including breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and thus the findings can have broad applications, and can emerge as a paradigm shift in the management of cancer. Narrative Despite the recent development of subtype-specific personalized therapy based on achievements in the fields of molecular and genetic profiling, the cancer treatment still has low efficacy that mostly arise from the limited ability of existing models to recapitulate the tumor heterogeneity and therefore predict the patient tumor responses to therapeutic agents. We propose to develop a novel personalized breast-cancer-ecosystem platform for personalized screening of cancer chemotherapeutics with extremely high accuracy by utilizing patient-derived tumor explant culture, defined tumor grade-matched biomaterial matrices, and autologous patient serum to mimic patient-specific tumor hallmarks.

"UCSC-Buck Specialized Genomic Data Analysis Center for the Genomic Data Analysis Network The “UCSC-Buck Genome Data Analysis Center for the Genomic Data Analysis Network” will develop state-of-the-art methods for integrating various types of data to discover the genetic pathways, the microenvironment, the originating cells, and the oncogenic processes driving the initiation and progression of tumors. The long term goals of the project are to identify highly accurate models detailing the faulty genetic circuitry at work in each subclone of a patient’s tumor, as well as any “normal” cells acting as accomplices by supporting the cancer microenvironment. The ultimate objective is to encode computer algorithms that can search a patient’s individual pathway diagram for the best combination of interventions to eliminate every tumor cell, while preserving the health of every normal cell, in their body. Integrative pathway analysis methods will be developed to reveal signatures of tumor subtypes from Pan-Cancer and external datasets. New technologies will be established for uncovering network models tailored to individual patients. The tools will be deployed as part of an active collaboration to support the specific projects of the Genome Data Analysis Network. Novel probabilistic graphical models will be used to infer disrupted signaling. Cellular signatures will be collected from the analysis of normal cells, cancer cell line models, and Pan-Cancer investigations. Novel machine-learning methods, guided by pathway mechanisms, will be established to identify cell state signatures in heterogeneous patient samples. This work will reveal rare mutations driving metastatic transformation that are currently of unknown significance. New clues about the genetic circuitry promoting response and resistance to treatment will be established. Finally, cross-tumor connections that relate tumors of one type to a different type will suggest new avenues for treatment. Computational strategies for interpreting the results of cancer genome sequencing projects are in  desperate need. To select appropriate treatment strategies for a patient, an accurate model of the  altered genetic wiring in the tumor is needed as well as how that wiring relates to other tumors  and to other normal cells at various stages of differentiation. The research will establish  resources and software to contribute such methodologies for the Genome Data Analysis Network  projects that will subsequently be released into the public domain to benefit the entire scientific  community.",UCSC-Buck Specialized Genomic Data Analysis Center for the Genomic Data Analysis Network,9549013,U24CA210990,"['Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Awareness ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cisplatin ', ' cis-Platinum ', ' cis-Dichlorodiammineplatinum(II) ', ' cis-Diamminedichloroplatinum(II) ', ' cis-Diamminedichloroplatinum ', ' cis-Diaminedichloroplatinum ', ' cis platinum compound ', ' cis dichlorodiammineplatinum ', ' Platinum Diamminodichloride ', "" Peyrone's Salt "", "" Peyrone's Chloride "", ' Dichlorodiammineplatinum ', ' Cysplatyna ', ' Cisplatinum ', ' Cisplatina ', ' Cis-platinum II Diamine Dichloride ', ' Cis-platinum II ', ' Cis-platinous Diamine Dichloride ', ' Cis-dichloroammine Platinum (II) ', ' Cis-diamminedichloro Platinum (II) ', ' Cis-diamminedichloridoplatinum ', ' Cis-diammine-dichloroplatinum ', ' CDDP ', ' Communities ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Institutes ', ' Leadership ', ' Libraries ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' North Carolina ', ' Paper ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' RNA ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Splicing ', ' Splicing ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Time ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Work ', ' Competence ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Public Domains ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' cancer progression ', ' tumor progression ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Investigation ', ' experience ', ' neoplastic cell ', ' Tumor Cell ', ' Protein Isoforms ', ' Isoforms ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Proteomics ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Functional RNA ', ' MicroRNAs ', ' miRNAs ', ' miRNA ', ' Micro RNA ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Normal Cell ', ' genome sequencing ', ' DNA Sequence Alteration ', ' genomic alteration ', ' Sequence Alteration ', ' Genetic mutation ', ' DNA mutation ', ' DNA Alteration ', ' Data ', ' mRNA Expression ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Tumor Subtype ', ' University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center ', ' MDACC ', ' University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Output ', ' cancer microenvironment ', ' tumor microenvironment ', ' oncogenomics ', ' cancer genomics ', ' tumor genome ', ' cancer cell genome ', ' cancer genome ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' Cancer cell line ', ' DNA copy number ', ' resistant ', ' Resistance ', ' Oncogenic ', ' computer algorithm ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' network models ', ' tumor ', ' treatment strategy ', ' TCGA ', ' The Cancer Genome Atlas ', ' genome analysis ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' positive responders ', ' extreme responders ', ' Extraordinary responder ', ' exceptional responders ', ' individual patient ', ' genomic data ', ' Genomic Data Analysis Network ', ' Genome Data Analysis Network ', ' Genomic Data Analysis Center ', ' Genome Data Analysis Center ', ' responsive patient ', ' patient response ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ,U24,2018,449240,CA-20,0.14313586798891617
"The CSBC Research Center for Cancer Systems Immunology at MSKCC SUMMARY Exciting clinical breakthroughs with checkpoint blockade antibodies and adoptive T cell transfers have transformed the field of cancer immunotherapy, demonstrating the power of harnessing the immune system to eliminate cancer cells. However, fundamental challenges and questions remain. Significant clinical responses have only been observed in a subset of patients and cancer types, and it is currently not known what biological properties of tumors determine clinical responses, nor what strategies to adopt in clinical contexts where current immunotherapies are ineffective. To ultimately address these clinical challenges and to design predictably effective cancer treatments, we must deepen our fundamental understanding of interactions between tumors and the immune system at the molecular, cellular, and systems levels. The CSBC Research Center for Cancer Systems Immunology at MSKCC will bring the tools of systems biology to investigate cancer-immune system interactions at multiple stages of disease progression to answer central questions in cancer immunology and inform the design of novel immunotherapeutic interventions. We have organized our Research Center around three central scientific projects that examine cancer-immune interactions at distinct stages of disease progression: cancer initiation and early tumorigenesis (Project I); established and progressing tumors (Project II); latent disease and metastasis in (Project III). In Project I, we will combine new epigenomics technologies and innovative single-cell analyses with state-of-the-art systems biology approaches to decipher the underlying molecular and epigenetic programs of dysfunctional tumor- specific T cell differentiation in early tumorigenesis. We will further elucidate how dynamics in the mutational tumor antigen landscape and stromal and immune cell populations determine such states and model and test in mouse and human tumors how distinct T cell states determine sensitivity to immune checkpoint blockade. In Project II, we will use quantitative analysis of cell types and cell states by functional, flow cytometric, population RNA-seq and droplet RNA sequencing together with ecological models of cancer, immune, and stromal cell populations to study the response of the tumor ecosystem to immunotherapeutic perturbations in established tumors. In Project III, we will examine the evolutionary dynamics of innate immune system control of metastatic disease, a new area of investigation in cancer immunology. We will investigate the heterogeneity of latent cancer cells in their capacity for immune evasion, and we will use quantitative methods, including live cell imaging, to model latent tumor cell evasion of innate immune control and the dynamics of cycles of latent cell proliferation and potential editing by NK cells. A Shared Resource Core will provide state-of-the-art single-cell droplet sequencing technology and computational analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data (scRNA- seq). This Shared Resource Core will be tasked with droplet sequencing technology development and design of novel algorithmic approaches and will interact with all three scientific Projects. Our Research Center will also carry out an innovative program of outreach and training activities at the local, national, and global levels to disseminate research findings in cancer systems immunology and to train young scientists in this emerging field. NARRATIVE Cancer immunotherapies are designed to harness the human immune system to attack cancer cells and eliminate tumors. Recent breakthroughs in cancer immunotherapy, such as checkpoint blockade agents, have generated great excitement, but in fact only a fraction of patients and tumor types respond to these new treatments. Our proposed Research Center will deploy tools from systems biology to study tumor-immune system interactions at multiple stages to disease progression at the molecular, cellular, and systems levels, with the ultimate goal of informing the development of novel cancer immunotherapeutic strategies.",The CSBC Research Center for Cancer Systems Immunology at MSKCC,9536765,U54CA209975,"['Algorithms ',

"Online Raman Diagnostics of Oncometabolites Project Abstract  Cancer cells utilize normal metabolic processes out of context to promote tumor survival. For example, Otto Warburg and others discovered that tumors have increased glucose uptake, glycolysis, and lactate production, often with a reduction in citric acid cycle. While “aerobic glycolysis” at first glance is energetically expensive for tumor cells because it circumvents high ATP production from the citric acid cycle, it allows cancer cells to survive under low nutrient or low oxygen conditions and to instead use glycolytic intermediates for the synthesis of essential cellular building blocks without further energy investment. This change in metabolite regulation suggests a powerful method for monitoring and diagnosing cancer.  This project seeks to develop surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) as online detection method for the characterization of metabolites from breast cancer tumor models. Using the SERS results from tumor lysates, diagnostic algorithms will be constructed to improve treatment for cancer. Results show that fluid dynamics can be used to increase the reproducibility and sensitivity of SERS detection in flowing liquids. We propose to develop methodology to enable the use this innovation to investigate metabolites in cancer cell lysates using capillary electrophoresis coupled to a SERS flow detector. We will investigate known metabolites that have been linked to cancer, as well as examine key metabolites associated with oncogenes. The SERS data collected will be used to formulate diagnostic algorithms that can provide a yes/no indicator of cancer.  The specific aims of this project are as follows:  · AIM 1. Demonstrate the utility of the novel flow detector to assess changes in key metabolites from  tumor cell lysates. The tumor cell lysates will be compared with non-cancerous cell lysates to  identify trends in these metabolites relevant to breast cancer.  · AIM 2. Compare the identification and quantification capabilities with the current gold standard, LC-  MS. This aim will assess how SERS characterization both compares with existing technology but  also increases coverage of the metabolome.  · AIM 3. We will use the metabolites to develop statistical machine learning algorithms to predict the  sample label (cancer or not). The predictor obtained will be used as a diagnostic tool of cancer. The development of new technologies that provide unique chemical specific information will enable improved diagnostic assays for the treatment of cancer. Relevance to Public Health. The proposed research seeks to develop new technology for the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. Cancer exhibits misregulation of metabolic process relative to normal cells.

"MDCT Quantification of hepatic tumor viability for assessment of cancer therapy Project Summary / Abstract Tumor imaging quantification is critical for diagnosis, staging, and treatment evaluation, and multi-detector CT (MDCT) is the clinical imaging modality commonly used for patients diagnosed with hepatic malignancy because of its relatively low cost and wide availability. Conventional tumor quantification using either linear or volumetric measurement has demonstrated significant limitations in the evaluation of malignant liver tumors such as for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) when being treated with targeted antiangiogenic therapies or locoregional therapies because changes in overall tumor size do not necessarily reflect tumor response to therapy. This leads to an unmet clinical demand to develop a functional tumor quantification biomarker for effective and accurate assessment of treatment response for liver cancer patients. The goal of this STTR project is to expand development of our functional tumor quantitative imaging biomarker (QIB), named hepatic tumor viability (HTV), for automated quantification of tumor viability of HCC using contrast-enhanced multi-phase hepatic MDCT images. The proposed HTV tool will be built upon existing technologies for quantitative imaging analysis of liver and liver tumors developed on the software platform “3DQI” in the 3D Imaging Lab at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), and will be evaluated using the MDCT datasets of 400 patients with advanced HCC treated with antiangiogenic therapies and trans-arterial chemoembolization (TACE) therapies collected at MGH Cancer Center. The specific aims of this Phase II project are: (1) Development of HTV biomarker: We will continue to enhance the HTV biomarker developed in our Phase I project to improve the accuracy of HCC tumor segmentation using machine-learning classifiers, and to expand the four-phase MDCT imaging protocol developed in Phase I to include that of three-phase MDCT by omitting pre-contrast imaging for flexible adoption in clinical practice, (2) Evaluation of HTV biomarker: We will integrate the HTV biomarker into our 3DQI platform to conduct a clinical study to evaluate the accuracy and clinical performance of the proposed HTV biomarker in the assessment of treatment response by assessing 400 advanced HCC cases treated with antiangiogenic and TACE therapies collected at MGH Cancer Center, and (3) Preparation of FDA 510(k) clearance submission: We will establish the quality management system for 3DQI/Liver to meet FDA regulation, and prepare the required documentation for FDA 510(k) clearance submission. This aim is important for the long-term project goal of clinical translation of advanced QIBs developed on the 3DQI/Liver platform for tumor monitoring and response assessment of varied hepatic diseases on both CT and MR images. The successful development and validation of the proposed HTV biomarker will have a high clinical impact by providing a more effective and accurate tumor quantification tool compared to conventional size-based methods for reliable assessment of tumor progression and evaluation of treatment response for patients with HCC. Project Narrative Tumor imaging quantification is indispensable for diagnosis, staging, and treatment evaluation, and multi-detector CT (MDCT) is often the modality used because of its relatively low cost and wide availability. This STTR phase II project continues to develop a quantitative imaging biomarker named hepatic tumor viability (HTV) for automated quantification of tumor viability of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using multi-phase hepatic MDCT images. The successful translation of the proposed HTV biomarker will provide a more effective and accurate tumor quantification biomarker compared to conventional tumor quantification using either linear or volumetric measurement for reliable assessment of tumor progression and evaluation of treatment response for patients with HCC.",MDCT Quantification of hepatic tumor viability for assessment of cancer

"Deconvolution of Epigenomic Data to Characterize Cellular Subpopulations Abstract With the advent of new DNA sequencing technologies, genomic data has moved to the forefront in the quest for individualized medicine. However, the lack of new computational tools to interpret and exploit the deluge of genomic data has severely hampered its clinical benefit. A further complication is that clinical genomic data is often obtained from tissues containing a mixture of different cell types. For example, tumor samples are a mixture of tumor subclones and normal cell lineages. As a platform for understanding this heterogeneity in tumor cell populations, our studies will focus on DNA methylation changes in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most prevalent, aggressive form of Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL). DNA methylation is cell type- specific, likely contributes to the phenotypic variation in tumor subclones, and plays key roles in gene regulation and lymphoma pathogenesis. Defining the methylation and transcriptional profiles of tumor subclones is necessary to identify potential drug targets, predict disease progression, and identify overall prognosis. Further, current computational approaches to understand epigenetic heterogeneity are not well- suited for tumor analysis and do not link epigenetic changes to expression. Here, we propose to develop a new computational approach that uses genomic methylation data from bulk samples to define DNA methylation- and expression-based subclonal populations and relate these populations to disease progression. Our approach exploits the fact that methylation levels are an accurate measure of the underlying distribution of allelic methylation states in the tumor (e.g. 30% methylation means 30% of the alleles are methylated). Our approach takes genome-wide methylation data as input, and outputs the number of subpopulations, their respective proportions, and each underlying subpopulation’s DNA methylation profile. After deconvolution, we will extend our previous work showing that DNA methylation profiles are predictive of expression levels, and apply tools from machine learning to estimate the relative expression profiles in each subpopulation. This approach will allow us to take advantage of the vast amount of data currently being collected in large-scale sequencing projects and obtain genome-wide methylation information from cellular subpopulations even when surface markers cannot be used to physically separate the different subpopulations. Lastly, we will assess the clinical relevance of these approaches by using them to understand the molecular changes found in tumor subpopulations from samples of relapsed DLBCL. We envision these methods can be applied as investigative tools first, and later as cost-effective clinical tools, to analyze the epigenetic and transcriptomic heterogeneity in different tumor types and diseased tissues. Public Narrative Tumors, including B-cell lymphomas, are comprised of heterogeneous populations of cells. Decoding the regulatory circuitry in these sub-populations is critical to understanding tumor metastasis, therapy resistance and relapse. We propose to develop a new computational approach to use genome-wide measurements of DNA methylation in primary tumors to understand the regulatory landscape of these subpopulations. All software will be made publically available to broadly advance cancer-research nationwide. Results from this work will improve our understanding of molecular mechanisms of B cell lymphoma development and relapse.",Deconvolution of Epigenomic Data to Characterize Cellular Subpopulations,9521585,R21LM012395,"['Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Antibodies ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cell Count ', ' Cell Number ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Complication ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Flow Cytometry ', ' flow cytophotometry ', ' Flow Microfluorometry ', ' Flow Microfluorimetry ', ' Flow Cytofluorometry ', ' Flow Cytofluorometries ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' lymph nodes ', ' lymph gland ', ' Lymph node proper ', ' Lymph Node Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Lymphoma ', ' Reticulolymphosarcoma ', ' Malignant Lymphoma ', ' Germinoblastoma ', ' Germinoblastic Sarcoma ', "" Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma "", ' non-Hodgkins disease ', ' Nonhodgkins Lymphoma ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Methylation ', ' Neoplasm Metastasis ', ' tumor cell metastasis ', ' cancer metastasis ', ' Secondary Tumor ', ' Secondary Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Tumor ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Mass ', ' Metastatic Lesion ', ' Metastasize ', ' Metastasis ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prognosis ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Technology ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Work ', ' B-Cell Lymphomas ', ' B lymphoma ', ' Measures ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Surface ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' prognostic ', ' Training ', ' Hematopoietic ', ' Measurement ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Germinal Center ', ' Structure of germinal center of lymph node ', ' Cell Lineage ', ' Therapeutic ', ' cancer cell ', ' Malignant Cell ', "" large cell Diffuse non-Hodgkin's lymphoma "", ' Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma ', ' DLBCL ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' programs ', ' cell type ', ' Techniques ', ' neoplastic cell ', ' Tumor Cell ', ' Primary Neoplasm ', ' Primary Tumor ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Advanced Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Advanced Cancer ', ' Genomics ', ' Normal Cell ', ' Address ', ' DNA Sequence Alteration ', ' genomic alteration ', ' Sequence Alteration ', ' Genetic mutation ', ' DNA mutation ', ' DNA Alteration ', ' Data ', ' Mixed Cellular Population ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Large-Scale Sequencing ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Output ', ' epigenomics ', ' cost ', ' cancer research ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' resistant ', ' Resistance ', ' transcriptomics ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' chemotherapy ', ' tumor ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' genome-wide ', ' global methylation ', ' genomewide methylation ', ' genome wide methylation ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' epigenome ', ' gDNA ', ' Genomic DNA ', ' unique treatment ', ' tailored treatment ', ' tailored therapy ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' individualized treatment ', ' individualized therapy ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' customized treatment ', ' customized therapy ', ' individualized medicine ', ' clinical sequencing ', ' intratumor heterogeneity ', ' intra-tumoral heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneity in tumors ', ' Intratumoral heterogeneity ', ' tumor heterogeneity ', ' genomic data ', ' DNAseq ', ' DNA seq ', ' DNA sequencing ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' ']",NLM,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,193265,MO-01,0.08067648933619254
"Proteogenomic Data Analysis for Cancer Systems Biology and Clinical Translation PROJECT SUMMARY It has become feasible to generate deep quantitative data for many of the molecules that are functional in cells, making it possible to survey a large number of tumors measuring genomic alterations and changes to transcripts, proteins and metabolites.

"Machine learning-based radiation toxicity mitigation in pediatric brain cancer Project Summary Radiation therapy (RT) has a proven record of efficacy in treating many forms of pediatric brain tumors. However, it is associated with long-term side effects due to damage to healthy tissue. This is especially important in the developing brain, where long-term deficits can be seen in the areas of intelligence, attention, memory and psychomotor processing. To mediate these deficits, there has been a push away from whole brain irradiation to more targeted treatment by using dose painting intensity modulated radiation therapy (DP-IMRT). However, in order to use these techniques, more information about how dosing to organs-at-risk (OARs) affects outcomes, including volumetric changes in the brain. Voxel Healthcare LLC (formerly Advanced Medical Systems LLC) is the developer of ClickBrain – an automatic pediatric MR brain segmentation tool that uses cloud-based deep learning (Google TensorFlow) technology for radiology clinical decision support. In Aim 1a, we extend ClickBrain to ClickBrain RT – a system that will combine ClickBrain's pre-treatment brain structure segmentation outputs with radiation planning CTs and MRs to calculate dosing to OARs. ClickBrain RT will also segment longitudinal MRIs (1 month, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years) to track outcomes via volumetric changes. We will use OAR dosing, demographics, tumor type and grade, chemotherapy information, OAR and tumor volumetric measurements to predict tumor and OAR volumetric outcomes. We will adapt our existing version of a multi-time point machine learning technique to do this prediction task. In Aim 1b, a user interface for this cloud computing-based proof-of-concept system will be built to allow the RT planner to import patient information and see changes in predicted longitudinal post-RT OAR and tumor volumes, based on adjusting OAR dosages for a particular patient. Our initial validation (Aim 2) will focus on an existing database of 51 germ cell tumor patients acquired as part of standard of care and previous studies at Children's Hospital Los Angeles. Germ cell tumors have relative uniform size and location and provide an ideal dataset to validate our proof-of-concept system. Our long-term goal for ClickBrain RT is to train the machine learning algorithm to provide optimized recommended OAR dosage ranges based on patient history and tumor information. Our software will allow radiation oncologists to optimize treatment and vastly improve long-term quality of life in pediatric brain tumor survivors. Narrative Mitigating radiation toxicity due to radiation therapy for the treatment of pediatric brain tumors is important to avoid long-term developmental side effects. Our ClickBrain RT software will use cloud computing-based deep learning technologies to automatically delineate key structures in the brain and to train a machine learning algorithm to predict volumetric changes due to treatment-related radiation dosing to these key structures. This will enable physicians to better avoid unnecessary radiation doses that may cause long-term deficits in children with brain tumors.",Machine learning-based radiation toxicity mitigation in pediatric brain cancer,9623177,R43CA233346,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Attention ', ' Award ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain Neoplasms ', ' tumors in the brain ', ' Brain Tumors ', ' Brain Neoplasia ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Cochlea ', ' Cochlear Organ ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hippocampus ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Pediatric Hospitals ', "" Children's Hospital "", ' Hypothalamic structure ', ' hypothalamic ', ' Hypothalamus ', ' Intelligence ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Manuals ', ' Maps ', ' Medical Records ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Microtomy ', ' Thin Sectioning ', ' Optic Chiasm ', ' Optic Decussation ', ' Optic Chiasmas ', ' Optic Chiasma ', ' Chiasma Opticum ', ' Chiasma ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Pituitary Gland ', ' Pituitary Nervous System ', ' Pituitary ', ' Hypophysis Cerebri ', ' Hypophysis ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Radiation Dosage ', ' Radiation therapy ', ' treatment with radiation ', ' radio-therapy ', ' radiation treatment ', ' Radiotherapy ', ' Radiotherapeutics ', ' Risk ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Technology ', ' Radiologic Technology ', ' Radiological Technology ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Cranial Irradiation ', ' cranial radiation ', ' brain radiation ', ' brain irradiation ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Mediating ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' dosage ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' morphometry ', ' brain visualization ', ' Brain imaging ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Germ Cell Neoplasms ', ' Germ cell tumor ', ' Survivors ', ' pediatric brain tumor ', ' pediatric brain neoplasm ', ' Childhood Brain Tumor ', ' Childhood Brain Neoplasm ', ' Training ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' Measurement ', ' Radiation Oncology ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' oncology ', ' radiation poisoning ', ' Acute Radiation Syndrome ', ' Radiation Toxicity ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Clinic ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' brain tissue ', ' Tumor Volume ', ' Height ', ' treatment planning ', ' Structure ', ' Lobe ', ' lobes ', ' Radiation ', ' Adverse effects ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' brain volume ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy ', ' Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy ', ' Intensity Modulated RT ', ' IMRT ', ' Prediction of Response to Therapy ', ' treatment response prediction ', ' treatment prediction ', ' therapy prediction ', ' predict treatment response ', ' predict therapy response ', ' predict therapeutic response ', ' Radiation Oncologist ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Scheme ', ' STTR ', ' Small Business Technology Transfer Research ', ' Validation ', ' sex ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Output ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' open source ', ' multi-task ', ' multitask ', ' chemotherapy ', ' demographics ', ' tumor ', ' standard of care ', ' pediatric brain cancer ', ' childhood brain cancer ', ' Pediatric Malignant Brain Tumor ', ' Childhood Malignant Brain Tumor ', ' cloud computer ', ' Cloud Infrastructure ', ' Cloud Computing ', ' cloud based ', ' targeted therapy ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted treatment ', ' behavior outcome ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' outcome prediction ', ' negative affectivity ', ' negative affect ', ' clinical decision support ', ' therapy optimization ', ' treatment optimization ', ' deep learning ', ' TensorFlow ', ' ']",NCI,"VOXEL HEALTHCARE, LLC",R43,2018,224726,CA-37,0.12949167540449108
"Integrated Discovery Pipeline for Tumor Neoantigens Project Summary Cancer immunotherapy is now established as a major therapeutic modality. Significant progress with checkpoint inhibitor monoclonal antibodies demonstrates durable tumor regression in metastatic melanoma, lung cancer and other malignancies. One conspicuous limitation is the paucity of validated tumor antigens, which impedes clinical investigators in their pursuit of developing new cancer immunotherapies. Tumor encoded non-synonymous mutations may provide a new source of potential target antigens. T cells recognize tumor missense mutations as amino acid substituted peptides presented in the context of major histocompatibility molecules on the cancer cell surface, thus implicating missense mutations as a source of patient-specific neoantigens. We recently described the first-in-human study to use next generation sequencing technologies to identify and validate tumor missense mutations as neoantigens. Our study demonstrates that vaccination increases the breadth and diversity of neoantigen-specific T cells resulting in a broad repertoire of effector CD8+ T cells that uniquely discriminates mutated antigens from wild type peptides ensuring tumor specificity. This proposal aims to find a unique solution to the scarcity of tumor antigens by developing a neoantigen discovery pipeline that integrates genomic and proteomic technologies. In this proposal, a unique academic-industry partnership comprised of an established team of experts, in cancer genomics, cancer proteomics, human immunology, and clinical oncology, aim to solve the challenging problem of tumor neoantigen discovery. The long-term goal is to develop a robust pipeline using cutting-edge technologies merged with machine learning algorithms to supply tumor neoantigens for clinical investigation. The goal of this proposal will be addressed in the experiments of the following specific aims: 1) to identify the repertoire of melanoma expressed somatic mutations by next generation sequencing technologies; 2) to develop a novel proteomics platform to identify melanoma neoantigens presented by HLA class I molecules; 3) to validate neoantigen identification in a vaccination protocol. The proposed pipeline will deliver a transformative solution for tumor antigen identification, should be translatable to other “immune responsive“ malignancies and enable the nascent discipline of precision medicine to provide effective and safe immunotherapies for cancer patients. Project Narrative This project is relevant to public health as it aims to develop a neoantigen discovery pipeline to address the paucity of validated cancer antigens available for immunotherapy. The pipeline integrates two powerful and well-established technologies, genomics and proteomics. If successful, this pipeline will enable the delivery of precision immunotherapy in a clinically relevant timeframe for patients with melanoma as well as other malignancies.",Integrated Discovery

"RADIOMICS-BASED PROGNOSTIC MODEL OF CERVICAL CANCER HABITATS Abstract Despite significant advances in disease prevention and screening, locally-advanced cervical cancer (LACC) continues to be an important world-wide public health problem. Responses to currently available treatments are highly variable among patients with similar constellations of accepted prognostic features, implying that chemo-radio sensitivity, patterns of local tumor proliferation, and the propensity of metastatic spread are highly dependent on each patient's potentially unique cervix cancer habitat. Radiomic analysis of pre-, in-, and post- treatment medical images is an exciting new class of prognostic cancer biomarkers for characterizing tumor habit and has shown promise in more accurately separating favorable- from unfavorable- prognosis for patients for several tumor sites. No such radiomic-based prognostic model has been developed, for LACC that supports meaningful personalization of local and systemic treatment or biologically treatment adaptation based on response of radiomic biomarker profiles to the initial fractions of radiotherapy. To support future personalized chemo-radiation therapy, we propose to exploit a large, prospectively collected database of ~400 LACC patients consisting of archived PET, MRI, and CT images, standard biomarkers, and clinical outcomes to develop an innovative and accurate radiomics-based prognostic model for predicting LACC treatment outcomes. Previous efforts to utilize high-dimensional radiomic feature spaces to predict cancer treatment outcomes have been compromised by small patient numbers relative to the feature space dimensionality; radiomic feature redundancy, feature heterogeneity and uncertainty; unbalanced outcome class patient cohorts; and intrinsic differences in prognostic information content for features extracted from different modality images. We propose a principled and systematic strategy to address these challenges: a novel combination of belief function theory (BFT) and more standard machine learning techniques. To achieve these goals, we propose the following specific aims. Aim 1: Develop a novel radiomics-based prognostic model for predicting outcomes of cervical cancer patients treated with definitive chemo-radiotherapy given longitudinal radiomic features from pre-, in-, and post treatment PET, CT, and MR images. Aim 2: Refine the developed prognostic model by use of the full 400 patient cases and systematically validate and test its performance. Aim 3: Investigate the potential clinical impact of the radiomic-based prognostic model and selected clinical applications. Clinical Impact and future plans: This project will result in a clinically useful family of models for predicting disease control outcomes from current LACC treatments. This clinical decision-making tool can be used to personalize initial treatment prescriptions as well as adaptive treatment prescription when combined with in-treatment radiomic biomarkers. We anticipate that many of the proposed methodological improvements investigated by this proposal will improve tumor response assessment in other disease sites.

"Accelerating Cancer Genomics with Cloud-scale Bioconductor PROJECT SUMMARY  The Bioconductor project is rooted in recognition that efﬁcient, rigorous, and reproducible analysis of high- dimensional data can be achieved when statisticians, biologists, and computer scientists federate efforts in a transparent and carefully engineered way. The project Accelerating Cancer Genomics with Cloud-scale Bio- conductor devises new approaches to carrying out genome-scale analysis of cancer data using cloud computing environments. The proposal is based on strategies that have proven highly effective in ﬁfteen years of supporting collaborative and carefully engineered software for genome scale analysis in computational biology in the Biocon- ductor project, based on the highly portable and widely adopted R language and environment for data analysis. In Aim 1 we develop architecture and infrastructure for scalably harvesting cloud-based representations of large- scale cancer genome studies such as The Cancer Genome Atlas, creating formal high-performance workﬂows for processing and interpreting cancer genome analyses, and providing packaging and data distribution schemes for moving data to the cloud for scalable analysis there. In Aim 2 we create and support independent creation of intuitive and cancer-relevant interface components supporting reproducible interactive exploration and analysis using the facilities of Rstudio. In Aim 3 we update and generalize the Bioconductor MLInterfaces metapackage to support advanced machine learning using the cancer-oriented strategies and facilities devised in Aims 1 and 2. Our proposal will beneﬁt large numbers of cancer researchers who will be taking advantage of cloud resources, probably with R close to hand, by marrying strengths of cloud-centric strategies for data archiving and query resolution, to the strengths of Bioconductor development and analysis capabilities. We have letters of support from the leadership of the three NCI Cancer Cloud Pilot projects for this project. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Despite major advances in elucidating mechanisms of tumor initiation and proliferation, treatment strategies for many cancers are ineffective, and patient-to-patient variation in treatment response suggests that personal targeting of cancer based on tumor molecular proﬁles will be necessary. This proposal takes a design and architecture approach from a widely used project for analyzing general data arising in genome-scale biology, and adapts it to new NCI-supported cloud-based data archives and analysis environments. The proposal will accelerate identiﬁcation of sources of variation of tumor responsiveness to treatment and will aid physicians in devising personalized antitumor strategies.",Accelerating Cancer Genomics with Cloud-scale Bioconductor,9478159,U01CA214846,"['Acceleration ', ' Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Awareness ', ' Base Sequence ', ' nucleic acid sequence ', ' Nucleotide Sequence ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biology ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Computers ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Hand ', ' Institutes ', ' Language ', ' Leadership ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Statistical Models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Motivation ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Engineering ', ' Computer Software Engineering ', ' Computer Software Development ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Ecological Systems ', ' Ecologic Systems ', ' Ecosystem ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Intuition ', ' Fostering ', ' data storage ', ' data retrieval ', ' Data Storage and Retrieval ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Collaborations ', ' Viewpoint ', ' Editorial Comment ', ' Commentary ', ' Comment ', ' Published Comment ', ' Letters ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Computational Biology ', ' computer biology ', ' Scientist ', ' Adopted ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' spelling ', ' Performance ', ' tumor initiation ', ' Informatics ', ' Structure ', ' Modality ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' response ', ' software development ', ' developing computer software ', ' develop software ', ' portability ', ' Genomics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Address ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Animal Cancer Model ', ' Data ', ' Harvest ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' molecular signature ', ' molecular profile ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' Mutation Spectra ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Resolution ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Collection ', ' Scheme ', ' Update ', ' Validation ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Output ', ' oncogenomics ', ' cancer genomics ', ' tumor genome ', ' cancer cell genome ', ' cancer genome ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' cancer type ', ' resistant ', ' Resistance ', ' computational resources ', ' computing resources ', ' Bioconductor ', ' usability ', ' prototype ', ' tumor ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' treatment response ', ' treatment strategy ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' genome-wide ', ' data format ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' TCGA ', ' The Cancer Genome Atlas ', ' genome analysis ', ' cloud computer ', ' Cloud Infrastructure ', ' Cloud Computing ', ' cloud based ', ' application programming interface ', ' Data Analytics ', ' driver mutation ', ' actionable variants ', ' actionable mutation ', ' cancer sub-types ', ' cancer subtypes ', ' data archive ', ' genomic data ', ' genomics cloud ', ' Genomic Data Commons ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' high dimensionality ', ' variation between patients ', ' variability between patients ', ' patient variation ', ' patient variability ', ' data deposition ', ' data submission ', ' TensorFlow ', ' ']",NCI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,U01,2018,438654,MA-07,0.06865803288931793
"MDCT Quantification of hepatic tumor viability for assessment of cancer therapy Project Summary / Abstract Tumor imaging quantification is critical for diagnosis, staging, and treatment evaluation, and multi-detector CT (MDCT) is the clinical imaging modality commonly used for patients diagnosed with hepatic malignancy because of its relatively low cost and wide availability. Conventional tumor quantification using either linear or volumetric measurement has demonstrated significant limitations in the evaluation of malignant liver tumors such as for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) when being treated with targeted antiangiogenic therapies or locoregional therapies because changes in overall tumor size do not necessarily reflect tumor response to therapy. This leads to an unmet clinical demand to develop a functional tumor quantification biomarker for effective and accurate assessment of treatment response for liver cancer patients. The goal of this STTR project is to expand development of our functional tumor quantitative imaging biomarker (QIB), named hepatic tumor viability (HTV), for automated quantification of tumor viability of HCC using contrast-enhanced multi-phase hepatic MDCT images. The proposed HTV tool will be built upon existing technologies for quantitative imaging analysis of liver and liver tumors developed on the software platform “3DQI” in the 3D Imaging Lab at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), and will be evaluated using the MDCT datasets of 400 patients with advanced HCC treated with antiangiogenic therapies and trans-arterial chemoembolization (TACE) therapies collected at MGH Cancer Center. The specific aims of this Phase II project are: (1) Development of HTV biomarker: We will continue to enhance the HTV biomarker developed in our Phase I project to improve the accuracy of HCC tumor segmentation using machine-learning classifiers, and to expand the four-phase MDCT imaging protocol developed in Phase I to include that of three-phase MDCT by omitting pre-contrast imaging for flexible adoption in clinical practice, (2) Evaluation of HTV biomarker: We will integrate the HTV biomarker into our 3DQI platform to conduct a clinical study to evaluate the accuracy and clinical performance of the proposed HTV biomarker in the assessment of treatment response by assessing 400 advanced HCC cases treated with antiangiogenic and TACE therapies collected at MGH Cancer Center, and (3) Preparation of FDA 510(k) clearance submission: We will establish the quality management system for 3DQI/Liver to meet FDA regulation, and prepare the required documentation for FDA 510(k) clearance submission. This aim is important for the long-term project goal of clinical translation of advanced QIBs developed on the 3DQI/Liver platform for tumor monitoring and response assessment of varied hepatic diseases on both CT and MR images. The successful development and validation of the proposed HTV biomarker will have a high clinical impact by providing a more effective and accurate tumor quantification tool compared to conventional size-based methods for reliable assessment of tumor progression and evaluation of treatment response for patients with HCC.

"Transforming family dogs into a powerful and accessible model for human cancer ABSTRACT There is an unmet need for novel approaches to cancer research, including improved model systems. Pet dogs are among the most promising natural models for translational cancer research​. They share our environment and develop cancers with clear clinical, histological, and genomic similarities to human cancer. We propose to use new genomic technology and a direct-to-dog-owner approach to overcome existing limitations of the canine model. To accomplish this, we will use new liquid biopsy technology, which makes it possible to sequence ​tumor exomes in circulating cell-free DNA from a blood sample, and thus achieve deeper understanding of tumor genomics without invasive biopsies. The power of these minimally invasive sampling technologies is greatest in application to very large sets of clinical samples. Family dogs, whose environments are shared with humans and for which tumor genomics are similar to human cancers, offer an unparalleled model in which to assemble clinical sets of size sufficient both to confirm the relevance of known genetic pathways, and to identify new ones. We propose to combine the power of cell-free DNA sequencing, ​the enthusiasm of citizen-scientist pet owners, and the clinical experience of veterinarians. We will create a research portal for collection of information on diagnosis, treatment, and outcome for thousands of dogs with cancer, as well as their environment and lifestyle. W​e will also develop new computational methodologies to identify genomic similarities between canine and human cancers. Comparison of these canine and human mutational profiles will enable matching of canine cancer subtypes with human cancer subtypes based on genetic pathways, facilitating canine trials to advance human clinical studies. We aim to:  Aim 1. ​Develop software to Identify canine models for human cancers using genomic data and  comprehensive, histology-blind analysis approach.  Aim 2. Develop and optimize ​cell-free DNA sampling and sequencing methods in dogs, including  ultra-low-pass whole genome sequencing and whole exome sequencing.  Aim 3. Implement a ​direct-to-dog-owner smartphone app to collect and validate detailed clinical, and  environmental data, paired with blood samples, for thousands of dogs. By combining the power of genome sequencing and new liquid biopsy technology with the opportunity to collect large sets of samples from a species whose cancers are genomically reflective of those in humans, our project​ will​ transform​ the scale and scope of translational cancer research and precision medicine. Project Narrative Pet dogs live in the same environments that we do, suggesting that profiling mutations in dog tumors could guide treatment of human cancers. With the help of veterinarians and citizen-scientist dog owners, we will build tools and resources needed to study cancer in thousands of dogs at once. This will help scientists find important genetic features of canine cancers, match them to specific human cancers, and translate what we learn into new cancer therapeutics.",Transforming family dogs into a powerful and accessible model for human cancer,9671372,R37CA218570,"['Biopsy ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' Diagnosis ', ' domestic dog ', ' canine ', ' Dogs Mammals ', ' Dogs ', ' Canine Species ', ' Canis familiaris ', ' Environment ', ' Evolution ', ' Genes ', ' Gold ', ' Histology ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Institutes ', ' Learning ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' longterm study ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Biological Models ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Silicones ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' base ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Blood Sample ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Histologic ', ' Histologically ', ' Veterinarians ', ' oncology ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Catalogs ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Inherited ', ' Hereditary ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Medical center ', ' experience ', ' Gene Mutation ', ' Gene Alteration ', ' human data ', ' cohort ', ' Chemical Exposure ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' Reporting ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' genetic risk factor ', ' inherited factor ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' software development ', ' developing computer software ', ' develop software ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' Dog family ', ' genome sequencing ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' molecular signature ', ' molecular profile ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' Mutate ', ' Collection ', ' Community Clinical Oncology Program ', ' Community Oncology ', ' CCOP ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' cancer genomics ', ' oncogenomics ', ' anticancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' blind ', ' open source ', ' chemotherapy ', ' comparative ', ' tumor ', ' minimally invasive ', ' exome ', ' exomes ', ' comparative genomics ', ' exome sequencing ', ' exome-seq ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted therapy ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' cell free DNA ', ' cell free circulating DNA ', ' citizen science ', ' scientific citizenship ', ' crowd-sourced science ', ' crowd science ', ' civic science ', ' citizen scientists ', ' amateur scientists ', ' amateur science ', ' predicting response ', ' response prediction ', ' predictor of response ', ' predictive response ', ' prediction of response ', ' genomic platform ', ' actionable mutation ', ' driver mutation ', ' actionable variants ', ' whole genome ', ' full genome ', ' entire genome ', ' cancer subtypes ', ' cancer sub-types ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic dataset ', ' genomic data-set ', ' liquid biopsy ', ' translational cancer research ', ' DNA sequencing ', ' DNAseq ', ' DNA seq ', ' smartphone Application ', ' iPhone Application ', ' iPhone App ', ' iOS application ', ' iOS app ', ' Smartphone App ', ' Smart Phone Application ', ' Smart Phone App ', ' Cellular Phone Application ', ' Cellular Phone App ', ' Cell phone App ', ' Cell Phone Application ', ' Android Application ', ' Android App ', ' translational model ', ' human model ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' analysis pipeline ', ' classifier algorithm ', ' ']",NCI,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R37,2019,634586,MA-02,0.04275733943404109
"Stimulated Raman imaging for label-free histology to guide brain tumor surgery ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of brain tumor surgery is to maximize removal of tumor without causing permanent neurologic deficits. Studies have shown that outcomes for patients depend strongly on these two variables. However, this is difficult because tumor tissue is often indistinguishable from healthy tissue in the operating room. Preoperative and intraoperative MRI through neuronavigation can be used to guide brain tumor surgery, but it is not able to accurately delineate the tumor margin due to the brain deformation and brain shift during surgery. H&E staining as the current gold standard is often performed intraoperatively for preliminary diagnosis, but it is not used to guide extent of resection routinely due to the limitations including tissue artifacts, labor-intensiveness, and time delay. Fluorescence guided surgery is beginning to be used to guided brain tumor surgery, but is generally not useful for low grade gliomas, the tumors which pose the greatest challenge and opportunity to extend survival and improve quality of life. Stimulated Raman imaging (SRI) has been used for rapid label-free biomolecular mapping in live tissue. Recently we have developed a novel approach with SRI to image nucleic acids, together with protein and lipids. Visualization of nucleic acids allows definition of nuclear morphology and chromatin structures, thereby enabling pathologic evaluation of clinically relevant cellular morphology, providing almost equivalent information to H&E staining. The goal of this translational research is to establish the methodology and practice for label-free histopathology with SRI for brain tumor diagnosis, and eventually develop it into a clinical device for ambient SR imaging of fresh tissue in the operating room in real time If the aims are achieved, this project will greatly improve the current clinical practice of brain tumor surgery by providing real time tissue diagnosis for more precise control of the extent of resection and preservation of neurologic function. Furthermore, this approach may be of value for all oncologic surgeries and other clinical pathology such as fine needle biopsies and bone marrow biopsy. The candidate for this award Dr. Fake Lu is a postdoctoral research fellow at Brigham and Women's Hospital. Dr. Lu has extensive experience and expertise in biophotonics and biomedical optics, specialized in system innovations of stimulated Raman microscopy and multiphoton microscopy for biomedical applications. BWH is an international leader in basic, clinical and translational research on human diseases, and has established multiple research programs to promote the work and professional career development of young investigators. BWH is also home to the National Center for Image Guided Therapy (P41) and the Advanced Multi-modality Image Guided operating suite (AMIGO) infrastructure which will greatly support to proposed research. Dr. Lu's long term research goal is to develop and apply advanced biophysical and optical technologies and devices to improve understanding, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases, such as cancers, for better health care. His long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator working at the frontier of translational research. The immediate objectives for the five-year award period is to 1) establish and evaluate label-free histopathology SRI for brain tumor diagnosis, 2) to demonstrate ambient imaging of surgically removed fresh tissue for diagnosis of brain tumors for real time guidance of neurosurgical resection, 3) to develop a novel stimulated Raman microscopy to collect full spectral data in parallel for label-free histopathology, as well as lipid biomarker screening, 4) t develop a computer algorithm for SR image analysis to realize automatic brain tumor diagnosis, and 5) finally by integrating the instrument and software to build and demonstrate a prototype of a clinical device for guiding neurosurgical resection of brain tumors. This device could also be used for other oncologic surgeries and will have great potential for commercialization. To conduct the proposed research, in addition to further develop his current strengths in biophotonics, stimulated Raman microscopy, and nonlinear optical microscopy, Dr. Lu plans to receive more education and training to enrich and expand his knowledge and expertise in the following four areas: 1) to receive critical training in conducting translational research, 2) to enrich his knowledge and deepen his understanding in brain tumor biology and medicine, 3) to learn skills in developing computer algorithms for SR image analysis, and 4) to prepare for writing grant applications and seeking funding independently. Dr. Lu will participate in 12 formal courses selected from those offered by Harvard Catalyst and Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. He will attend weekly seminars at BWH and Harvard University, seminar series on biomedical image analysis organized by MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. He will also attend one or two annual conferences per year to present his work for peer discussion. A strong mentoring team was organized to provide solid support to the proposed research and Dr. Lu's career development, including Dr. Alexandra Golby in neurosurgery at BWH, Prof. X. Sunney Xie in coherent Raman microscopy at Harvard, Prof. Nathalie Agar in molecular cancer diagnosis at BWH, Prof. Polina Golland in computer-based image analysis at MIT, and Dr. Sandro Santagata in neuropathology at BWH. This career development award will provide Dr. Lu with the training and skills needed to transition into an independent investigator in translational research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Surgery is the standard treatment for brain tumors, and the goal of brain tumor surgery is to completely remove the tumor without causing neurologic deficits. However, it is often difficult to distinguish normal and cancerous tissue during surgery. This project aims to develop a novel tool based on stimulated Raman microscopy to image fresh brain tissue in a label-free manner, providing comparable histological information to conventional H&E staining, to guide brain tumor resection in real time in the operating room.",Stimulated Raman imaging for label-free histology to guide brain tumor surgery,9724467,R00EB020749,"['Agar ', ' Algorithms

"Integrated Informatic and Experimental Evaluations of Cancer Chronotherapy ABSTRACT Years of clinical experience and a growing body of basic research suggest that chemotherapeutic activity can change with time-of-day. But when should our patients take their medicines? Must we test each new agent for circadian modulation in both efficacy and toxicity? Which tumors are most sensitive to chemotherapy administration time? Can we tailor our recommendations for individual patients? Temporal variation in the abundance of drug targets, transporters, and metabolizing enzymes, in both tumors and normal tissues, underlies circadian variation in drug activity. Until recently almost all we knew about tissue specific circadian rhythms came from normal mice. Without human data, a mechanistic, hypothesis-driven transition to medical practice has been slow. Recently we developed CYCLOPS (CYCLic Ordering by Periodic Structure) a machine-learning algorithm to uncover human transcriptional oscillations using existing, unordered biopsy samples. We used CYCLOPS to explore circadian rhythms in human lung and liver, identify disrupted rhythms in hepatocellular carcinoma, and predict circadian changes in drug effectiveness. This proposal will greatly expand that work and accelerate its translation to clinical oncology. Using public data, we will describe the molecular rhythms in an array of normal human tissues and thus the times of day when these tissues are least sensitive to specific drug toxicities. We will also describe rhythms in select tumors, identifying circadian times and cell cycle phases when cancers are most distinct from surrounding tissue and thus uniquely sensitive to various treatments. We will explore the influence of specific mutations and tumor markers on the rhythms observed in patients. Mapping these data onto pharmacogenomics databases we can make testable prediction as to the drugs and side effects most influenced by circadian time. Finally using both experimental mouse data and our preliminary human results, we have compiled a list of some of the most promising chronotheraputic candidates. We will expand and refine this list over the course of the study, testing several of these predictions in established animal models, and exploring the promise and practical principles of cancer chronotherapy. Taken together these aims will help catalyze chronotheraputic translation to clinical oncology and help delineate the role of time in precision cancer therapy. PROJECT NARRATIVE Circadian, or daily, rhythms influence nearly every aspect of our physiology. The influence of daily rhythms on cancer biology and treatment is particularly strong.

"Quantifying Multiscale Competitive Landscapes of Clonal Diversity in Glioblastoma ABSTRACT  Glioblastoma (GBM) exhibits profound intratumoral molecular heterogeneity that contributes to treatment resistance and poor survival. Specifically, each tumor comprises multiple molecularly-distinct subpopulations with different treatment sensitivities. This heterogeneity not only portends the pre-existence of resistant molecular subpopulations, but also the communications between neighboring subpopulations that further modulate tumorigenicity and resistance. In fact, a minority tumor subpopulation with EGFRvIII mutation has been shown to potentiate a majority subpopulation with wild-type EGFR to increase tumor growth, cell survival, and drug resistance. This type of cooperativity presents clear implications for improving GBM treatment. Yet compared to other tumor types, the interactions in GBM remain critically understudied. A significant barrier to studying the interactions between molecularly-distinct subpopulations is the challenge of tissue sampling in GBM. In particular, contrast-enhanced MRI (CE-MRI) routinely guides surgical biopsy and resection of the MRI enhancing core, but fails to address the diverse subpopulations of the surrounding non-enhancing parenchyma (so called “brain around tumor” or BAT). These unresected residual subpopulations in BAT represent the main contributors to tumor recurrence, which can exhibit different therapeutic targets (and interactions) compared with enhancing biopsies. To address the limitations of tissue sampling, imaging techniques can help quantitatively characterize tumors in their entirety, including unresected BAT regions. Our group has used multi-parametric MRI and image-guided biopsies to develop and validate machine-learning (ML) models of intratumoral genomic heterogeneity, with particular focus on the BAT zone. In Aim 1, will we collect and molecularly profile a large set of image-recorded stereotactic biopsies in primary GBM patients to quantify the diversity of molecularly-distinct subpopulations, as well as their phenotypic niches, throughout the BAT zone. We will assess local heterogeneity at the biopsy level and also co-localize regional patterns and rates of recurrence on serial MRI. In Aim 2, we will use these biopsies and spatially matched MRI metrics to refine our existing ML predictive models. We will use these ML models to co- localize spatial patterns of molecularly-distinct subpopulations (and their phenotypic niches) to quantify their risk of regional recurrence. In Aim 3, we will functionally validate the subpopulation interactions observed in Aims 1 and 2 using patient derived xenograft (PDX) models. We will also validate these interactions in human GBM using a subset of spatially matched biopsies from primary and recurrent tumors in the same patients. This proposal leverages our unique expertise in image-guided tissue analysis and MRI-based computational modeling to study the diversity of molecularly-distinct subpopulations and the evolving competitive landscapes in human GBM. This work will help risk stratify patients in future targeted clinical drug trials and should also facilitate new strategies (e.g., adaptive therapy) to exploit subpopulation co-dependency for therapeutic benefit. PROJECT NARRATIVE  We propose here a novel strategy that identifies the potential molecular underpinnings of treatment resistance within the zone where tumor almost always recurs. By developing image-based models that quantify the diversity of molecularly-distinct subpopulations (and their interactions) within individual tumors, the proposed work will improve image-based diagnosis and therapeutic strategies in the paradigm of individualized oncology.",Quantifying Multiscale Competitive Landscapes of Clonal Diversity in Glioblastoma,9767744,U01CA220378,"['Biopsy ', '

"Isolating and mitigating sequentially dependent perceptual errors in clinical visual search Project Summary When looking at an x-ray, radiologists are typically asked to localize a tumor (if present), and to classify it, judging its size, class, position and so on. Importantly, during this task, radiologists examine on a daily basis hundreds and hundreds of x-rays, seeing several images one after the other. A main underlying assumption of this task is that radiologists’ percepts and decisions on a current X-ray are completely independent of prior events. Recent results showed that this is not true: our perception and decisions are strongly biased by our past visual experience. Although serial dependencies were proposed to be a purposeful mechanism to achieve perceptual stability of our otherwise noisy visual input, serial dependencies play a crucial and deleterious role in the everyday task performed by radiologists. For example, an x-ray containing a tumor can be classified as benign depending on the content of the previously seen x-ray. Given the importance and the impact of serial dependencies in clinical tasks, in this proposal, we plan to (1) establish, (2) identify and (3) mitigate the conditions under which serial effects determine our percepts and decisions in tumor search tasks. In Aim 1, we will establish the presence of serial effects in four different clinically relevant domains: tumor detection, tumor classification, tumor position and recognition speed. In Aim 2, we plan to identify the specific boundary conditions under which visual serial dependence impacts tumor search in radiology. In Aim 3, once we will fully understand these boundary conditions in Aim 2, we will propose a series of task and stimulus manipulations to control and mitigate the deleterious effects of visual serial dependence on tumor search. As a result of these manipulations, visual search performance should improve in measurable ways (detection, classification, position, speed). Aim 3 is particularly crucial because it will allow us to propose new guidelines which will greatly improve tumor recognition in x-ray images, making this task even more effective and reliable. Taken together, the proposed studies in Aim 1, 2, and 3 will allow us to establish, identify, and mitigate the deleterious effect of serial dependencies in radiological search tasks, which could have a significant impact on the health and well-being of patients everywhere. ! ! ! Project Narrative Our proposal is designed to investigate the detrimental impact of visual serial dependencies in clinical settings. Serial dependencies significantly impact our perceptual experience, but little is known about their detrimental consequences when radiologists are asked to detect tumors in x-rays. Crucially, the final goal of our research project is to develop recommendations and guidelines to mitigate the negative effect of serial effects and, thus, improve diagnosis accuracy.",Isolating and mitigating sequentially dependent perceptual errors in clinical visual search,9707393,R01CA236793,"['Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' computer vision ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Judgment ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Play ', ' Radiology ', ' General Radiology ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' Reading ', ' Recommendation ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' X-Ray Medical Imaging ', ' X-Ray Imaging ', ' Roentgenography ', ' Radiography ', ' Diagnostic X-Ray Radiology ', ' Diagnostic X-Ray ', ' Diagnostic Radiology ', ' Conventional X-Ray ', ' Diagnostic radiologic examination ', ' Xrays ', ' X-Rays Radiation ', ' X-Rays ', ' X-Radiation ', ' Roentgen Rays ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' Stimulus ', ' Visual ', ' radiologist ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Dependence ', ' Event ', ' Scanning ', ' Visual system structure ', ' Visual System ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' diagnostic accuracy ', ' Accuracy of Diagnosis ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' Reporting ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' visual search ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Measurable ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Impairment ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' tumor ', ' laboratory experiment ', ' laboratory exercise ', ' laboratory assignment ', ' laboratory activity ', ' lab experiment ', ' lab assignment ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2019,313021,CA-13,0.06375684556286822
"Brain Cancer Radio-Pathomics for Predicting Heterogeneous Cytology Abstract High-grade brain cancer (glioblastoma) is a devastating disease that very few patients survive long-term. The average life expectancy is 15 months, and throughout therapy patients undergo serial MR imaging for monitoring tumor response. It is not well understood how heterogeneity at the cellular and molecular levels affects the macroscopic imaging characteristics of these tumors.  The long-term goal of this project is to provide imaging tools and biomarker integration strategies for individualizing glioblastoma treatment. The overall objective is to combine radiographic imaging with histopathological samples (i.e., radio-pathomics) to create and validate predictive tools for accurately defining tumor margins and spatial molecular profiles. Our central hypothesis is that microscopic glioblastoma cytological features and spatially dependent molecular profiles are reliably detectable and quantifiable with macroscopic MR imaging. Two specific aims will objectively test this hypothesis by first determining which microscopic tissue features contribute to distinct measurements with MR imaging, and second, determining the performance of machine learning algorithms for predictively mapping these heterogeneous histological features. ! Project Narrative This project will provide a detailed understanding of how brain tumors at the cellular level appear on macroscopic imaging by examining whole brain human samples and clinical MRI scans. We will develop computational algorithms trained with histology to recognize patterns in MRI scans (i.e. radiopathomics), which will negate the need for tissue.

"Phase 1 cross over biodistribution study of [203Pb]VMT01 for single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and [68Ga]VMT02 for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of stage 4 melanoma SIGNIFICANCE: Melanoma incidence is rising faster than any other cancer and metastatic melanoma is typically fatal. Responses to targeted and immunotherapies can be remarkable, but low response rates, acquired resistance, and adverse side effects limit long-term quality of life for these patients. The overall response rate to all therapies remains dismally near 50% and the 5-year survival is <25%. Preclinical studies have identified radiolabeled peptides that target the melanocortin receptor 1 (MC1R) as a potential therapeutic alternative. While this approach using -particle emitters has been largely ineffective preclinically, previous publications and our Phase I data have demonstrated efficacy of Viewpoint’s MC1R-targeted VMT01 -particle therapy in mice bearing melanoma tumors. Thus, VMT01 is designed to meet the significant unmet medical need to improve outcomes for these patients (initial indication of progressive stage 4 metastatic melanoma), with potential for expanded indications in combination with FDA-approved melanoma drugs (e.g., immunotherapies). In this revised Phase II SBIR project, Viewpoint will complete a Phase 1 first-in-human clinical trial to determine the safety of its companion diagnostics. It is further expected that the company will have gained a preliminary understanding of the effectiveness of [68Ga]VMT02 imaging (PET) to identify MC1R positive tumors and the utility of [203Pb]VMT01 imaging (SPECT) for performing patient dosimetry for personalized [212Pb]VMT01 -therapy. PREDICATE PHASE I MILESTONES include: efficacy (therapy and imaging) in mice; pharm/tox of lead VMT01; automated radiopharmaceutical production with GMP kits; exclusive licenses to IP; clinical consortium with Mayo Clinic and 203Pb supply with Lantheus Medical Imaging; CRO for statistics/clinical data (Compleware, Inc.); and a radiopharmacy partner (Hotshots Nuclear Medicine) for manufacturing/distribution of [203Pb]VMT01. EQUITY INVESTMENTS: Viewpoint has secured $650,000 in equity investment to establish manufacturing of 212Pb generators for future clinical therapy trials. The company will complete the following Aims toward its goals. AIM 1. Secure FDA “safe to proceed” designation to conduct the Phase 1 imaging trial of [203Pb]VMT01 and [68Ga]VMT02 under IND. AIM 2. Complete a Phase 1 safety and biodistribution study of [203Pb]VMT01 and [68Ga]VMT02 imaging in human subjects and demonstrate their utility for identifying MC1R positive tumors and performing patient-specific dosimetry. OUTCOMES: We expect to demonstrate the clinical safety of [203Pb]VMT01 and [68Ga]VMT02.

"Multi-Omic Single-Cell System for Improved Combination Cancer Immunotherapy Monitoring and Implementation IsoPlexis proposes to deliver a novel multi-omic method for targeted profiling of both the TCR sequence and proteome from an array of 1000+ single cells. Specifically, we will deliver a single-cell, TCR sequencing and protein capture assay for identifying responsive antigen specific TCRs, and concurrently evaluate these T-cells for functional response to that antigen. The challenge remains to link the activation of quiescent T-cell embedded in tumors by combination immunotherapies to patient outcome. Determining the combination of therapies to which each individual patient best responds indicates the best course of treatment. The quality of single-cell polyfunctional response of these immune cells correlates to positive outcomes far better than traditional bulk analysis. For example, PD-1 is upregulated upon T-cell activation while PD-L1 is expressed by a range of cell types. Since PD-1/PD-L1 interactions negatively regulate T cell immune function, PD-1/PD-L1 blockade can rescue effector T cell function. Critical to analyzing TILs is to assess (1) these T-cells’ function in the tumor environment in order to enable trial leaders to predict responders vs non-responders, a critical problem in immuno-oncology, and (2) to understand the TCR Sequence of the highest functioning cells. IsoPlexis single- cell secretion analysis exceeds its competition in the generation and quantitation of highly-multiplexed, single- cell data. Additional single-cell data from the TCR sequence would help to link antigen specificity to polyfunctional T cells involved in patient response, for improved biomarkers and targeted T-cell therapy development. We propose the following specific aims: (1) develop SCBC flow cell for the dual capture of multiplexed proteins and transcriptome on-device. (2a) produce a miniaturized and benchtop automated instrument of the existing instrument for multi-omic applications. 2b) develop a software suite for automated data processing and intuitive integrated informatics of polyfunctional and transcriptome data. 3) Establish patient learning of phenotype & genotype information in multiple trials, applied with machine learning of large patient genotype/phenotype data. At the end of our Phase II grant, we will demonstrate a dual TCR/proteomic assay on a fully-automated miniaturized SCBC instrument, the IsoMini, and software suite that will be successfully used across three combination therapy trials at Yale, Stanford and Fred Hutch. As successes in personalized medicine have continued to move the field forward, there is a growing need to predict responder differences in combination cancer therapies. The challenge remains to link the activation of quiescent T-cell embedded in tumors (TILs) by combination immunotherapies to patient outcome. IsoPlexis automated high-throughput platform using highly-multiplexed, single-cell measurements allows the simultaneous identification of both antigen specificity by TCR sequencing and functional effects by polyfunctional cytokine secretion. This would allow clinicians to finally have a tool to identify the specific TCR of the highest responding TILs necessary for the effective development of combination therapies.",Multi-Omic Single-Cell

"Quantifying Multiscale Competitive Landscapes of Clonal Diversity in Glioblastoma ABSTRACT  Glioblastoma (GBM) exhibits profound intratumoral molecular heterogeneity that contributes to treatment resistance and poor survival. Specifically, each tumor comprises multiple molecularly-distinct subpopulations with different treatment sensitivities. This heterogeneity not only portends the pre-existence of resistant molecular subpopulations, but also the communications between neighboring subpopulations that further modulate tumorigenicity and resistance. In fact, a minority tumor subpopulation with EGFRvIII mutation has been shown to potentiate a majority subpopulation with wild-type EGFR to increase tumor growth, cell survival, and drug resistance. This type of cooperativity presents clear implications for improving GBM treatment. Yet compared to other tumor types, the interactions in GBM remain critically understudied. A significant barrier to studying the interactions between molecularly-distinct subpopulations is the challenge of tissue sampling in GBM. In particular, contrast-enhanced MRI (CE-MRI) routinely guides surgical biopsy and resection of the MRI enhancing core, but fails to address the diverse subpopulations of the surrounding non-enhancing parenchyma (so called “brain around tumor” or BAT). These unresected residual subpopulations in BAT represent the main contributors to tumor recurrence, which can exhibit different therapeutic targets (and interactions) compared with enhancing biopsies. To address the limitations of tissue sampling, imaging techniques can help quantitatively characterize tumors in their entirety, including unresected BAT regions. Our group has used multi-parametric MRI and image-guided biopsies to develop and validate machine-learning (ML) models of intratumoral genomic heterogeneity, with particular focus on the BAT zone. In Aim 1, will we collect and molecularly profile a large set of image-recorded stereotactic biopsies in primary GBM patients to quantify the diversity of molecularly-distinct subpopulations, as well as their phenotypic niches, throughout the BAT zone. We will assess local heterogeneity at the biopsy level and also co-localize regional patterns and rates of recurrence on serial MRI. In Aim 2, we will use these biopsies and spatially matched MRI metrics to refine our existing ML predictive models. We will use these ML models to co- localize spatial patterns of molecularly-distinct subpopulations (and their phenotypic niches) to quantify their risk of regional recurrence. In Aim 3, we will functionally validate the subpopulation interactions observed in Aims 1 and 2 using patient derived xenograft (PDX) models. We will also validate these interactions in human GBM using a subset of spatially matched biopsies from primary and recurrent tumors in the same patients. This proposal leverages our unique expertise in image-guided tissue analysis and MRI-based computational modeling to study the diversity of molecularly-distinct subpopulations and the evolving competitive landscapes in human GBM. This work will help risk stratify patients in future targeted clinical drug trials and should also facilitate new strategies (e.g., adaptive therapy) to exploit subpopulation co-dependency for therapeutic benefit. PROJECT NARRATIVE  We propose here a novel strategy that identifies the potential molecular underpinnings of treatment resistance within the zone where tumor almost always recurs. By developing image-based models that quantify the diversity of molecularly-distinct subpopulations (and their interactions) within individual tumors, the proposed work will improve image-based diagnosis and therapeutic strategies in the paradigm of individualized oncology.",Quantifying Multiscale Competitive Landscapes of Clonal Diversity in Glioblastoma,9895187,U01CA220378,"['Biopsy ', '

"Targeting Tumors with NF1 Loss ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Genomic information can allow investigators to devise precision therapies that target molecular lesions specific to a patient's cancer. One of the molecular lesions present in many malignant tumors is loss of the NF1 tumor suppressor, which is a driver in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), one of the most frequently inherited genetic disorders. NF1 exhibits a broad clinical spectrum including benign nervous system tumors called neurofibromas, low-grade astrocytomas, pheochromocytoma, and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. Plexiform neurofibromas (PN) occur in deep nerves and can degenerate into malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), chemo- and radiation-resistant sarcomas with a dismal 20% five-year survival rate. In NF1 carriers, the lifetime risk is 30% for PN and 8-15% for MPNST. NF1 mutations are also found in sporadic tumors including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), melanoma, pheochromocytoma, ovarian, uterine, and lung cancers. Furthermore, in animal models and human tumor lines NF1 loss has been shown to drive GBM. A targeted molecular therapy designed to inhibit tumor-initiating and -promoting cells would substantially advance our ability to treat tumors that develop as a result of NF1 loss. Using complementary screening platforms, we identified small molecules that selectively killed or stopped the growth of cells carrying a mutation in NF1 as well as their molecular targets. In this application we focus on our top small molecule leads and the power of our model systems to test the hypothesis that aggressive neurological cancers that are known to be driven by NF1 loss and for which no cure exists, including PN, MPNST and GBM, will respond to molecules that we identified as synthetic lethal with NF1 loss. For this, we will determine pharmacokinetic properties of our top small molecule leads and, where needed, conduct structure-activity relationship studies to improve kinetics and/or reduce toxicity in order to test their efficacy in pre-clinical models of PN and GBM. We will leverage our model systems to define the mechanisms of action of our small molecule leads and add to our pipeline drugs in clinical trials that share the same targets. In addition to mutational inactivation, some GBM tumors exhibit down-regulation of the NF1 protein. Our lead compounds also stopped the growth of human GBM and neuroblastoma cells with low NF1 protein in vitro, supporting the broad application of the small molecule leads that we have identified. To capture tumors that have lost NF1 by any mechanism, we constructed an RNA-based classifier, which is capable of identifying downstream transcriptomic effects that indicate NF1 inactivation in GBM, using machine learning. We will apply the RNA-based classifier, along with targeted sequencing of NF1, to identify additional patient derived xenograft (PDX) GBM tumors that have an inactivating mutation of NF1 or molecular signatures of NF1 loss and test their response to our lead compounds in pre-clinical models. We expect that this work will provide new targets and therapeutic leads for aggressive neurological cancers driven by NF1 loss. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The work described in this proposal aims to find the Achilles heel of aggressive neurological cancers driven by NF1 loss for which no cure exists. These cancers include neurofibromas, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, glioblastoma (GBM), and neuroblastomas, all with dismal 5-year survival rates. Our multidisciplinary approach to develop an innovative conduit for identifying new targets with potential to cure such malignancies addresses an unmet clinical need.",Targeting Tumors with NF1

"The CSBC Research Center for Cancer Systems Immunology at MSKCC SUMMARY Exciting clinical breakthroughs with checkpoint blockade antibodies and adoptive T cell transfers have transformed the field of cancer immunotherapy, demonstrating the power of harnessing the immune system to eliminate cancer cells. However, fundamental challenges and questions remain. Significant clinical responses have only been observed in a subset of patients and cancer types, and it is currently not known what biological properties of tumors determine clinical responses, nor what strategies to adopt in clinical contexts where current immunotherapies are ineffective. To ultimately address these clinical challenges and to design predictably effective cancer treatments, we must deepen our fundamental understanding of interactions between tumors and the immune system at the molecular, cellular, and systems levels. The CSBC Research Center for Cancer Systems Immunology at MSKCC will bring the tools of systems biology to investigate cancer-immune system interactions at multiple stages of disease progression to answer central questions in cancer immunology and inform the design of novel immunotherapeutic interventions. We have organized our Research Center around three central scientific projects that examine cancer-immune interactions at distinct stages of disease progression: cancer initiation and early tumorigenesis (Project I); established and progressing tumors (Project II); latent disease and metastasis in (Project III). In Project I, we will combine new epigenomics technologies and innovative single-cell analyses with state-of-the-art systems biology approaches to decipher the underlying molecular and epigenetic programs of dysfunctional tumor- specific T cell differentiation in early tumorigenesis. We will further elucidate how dynamics in the mutational tumor antigen landscape and stromal and immune cell populations determine such states and model and test in mouse and human tumors how distinct T cell states determine sensitivity to immune checkpoint blockade. In Project II, we will use quantitative analysis of cell types and cell states by functional, flow cytometric, population RNA-seq and droplet RNA sequencing together with ecological models of cancer, immune, and stromal cell populations to study the response of the tumor ecosystem to immunotherapeutic perturbations in established tumors. In Project III, we will examine the evolutionary dynamics of innate immune system control of metastatic disease, a new area of investigation in cancer immunology. We will investigate the heterogeneity of latent cancer cells in their capacity for immune evasion, and we will use quantitative methods, including live cell imaging, to model latent tumor cell evasion of innate immune control and the dynamics of cycles of latent cell proliferation and potential editing by NK cells. A Shared Resource Core will provide state-of-the-art single-cell droplet sequencing technology and computational analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data (scRNA- seq). This Shared Resource Core will be tasked with droplet sequencing technology development and design of novel algorithmic approaches and will interact with all three scientific Projects. Our Research Center will also carry out an innovative program of outreach and training activities at the local, national, and global levels to disseminate research findings in cancer systems immunology and to train young scientists in this emerging field. NARRATIVE Cancer immunotherapies are designed to harness the human immune system to attack cancer cells and eliminate tumors. Recent breakthroughs in cancer immunotherapy, such as checkpoint blockade agents, have generated great excitement, but in fact only a fraction of patients and tumor types respond to these new treatments.

"Integrative framework for identifying dysregulated mechanisms in the tumor-immune microenvironment Project Summary/Abstract Current cancer therapies provide targeted treatments attacking specific cells, however, tumor cells are heterogeneous and evolving. To develop personalized treatments, we need to understand the composition of cell types in the tumor and the disrupted regulatory mechanisms that lead to cancer stem cells (CSCs). CSCs are resistant to standard therapies and have the ability to form new tumors leading to relapse and metastasis. Immunotherapies harnessing the immune system can be particularly successful in targeting CSCs, however, their mechanisms of action are not well understood. I hypothesize that an unbiased study of the complex tumor microenvironment containing elusive resistant CSCs and interacting immune populations can be achieved with high-dimensional genome-wide data, such as state-of-the-art single-cell resolution transcriptional integrated with epigenetic measurements, using Bayesian statistical tools that are ideal for distinguishing technical noise from biological heterogeneity and integrating different data types. I capitalize on our previous work in collaboration with the Alexander Rudensky Lab on characterizing immune cell populations in breast cancer tumors, using a computational method we developed in the Dana Pe’er Lab for clustering cells in single-cell transcriptomic data while simultaneously normalizing cells and correcting batch effects. In my PhD work, I showed the power of incorporating epigenetic data in inferring regulatory programs. Hence, in my K99 mentored phase, I aim to develop a computational framework for integrating epigenetic data with single-cell transcriptomic data to infer leukemic stem cells and dysregulated mechanisms in Acute Myeloid Leukemia in collaboration with Ross Levine (Aim 1). I have chosen AML as it involves enrichment of epigenetic mutations and the normal hematopoiesis system is well-characterized and would serve as a reference. As an independent investigator in the R00 phase, I will extend this framework to infer CSCs and dysregulations in the tumor as well as composition of immune cells and their reprogramming in under-characterized solid tumors, in collaboration with Benjamin Neel and others in my future institute (Aim 2). I then aim to use this toolbox to study the impact of immunotherapy treatments on the tumor-immune microenvironment in collaboration with Catherine Wu and my future institute (Aim 3). We expect that our results lead to insights into regulatory mechanisms that are disrupted in cancer and drive heterogeneous populations. We would also infer mechanisms of action of immunotherapies in the tumor-immune microenvironment. This proposal describes a training plan to advance my career to an independent investigator at the interface of machine learning and cancer biology. During the K99 phase, I will be supported by an outstanding and interdisciplinary team of advisors and collaborators with expertise in all aspects of the proposed research. Together with institutional support from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and formal coursework and training, I will bridge my knowledge gap in cancer biology and gain the communication and leadership skills vital for my transition. Project Narrative  Cancer treatments lead to favorable outcomes only in a subset of patients due to significant heterogeneity in tumor cells. To develop treatments tailored to each patient and the composition of cell types in each tumor, we need to characterize the complex populations of tumor cells and their dysregulated mechanisms. I propose that an unbiased characterization can be achieved with an interdisciplinary framework of single-cell resolution transcriptional and epigenetic measurements, that are integrated with principled computational tools.",Integrative framework for identifying dysregulated mechanisms in the tumor-immune microenvironment,9743114,K99CA230195,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Bone Marrow ', ' Bone Marrow Reticuloendothelial System ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Communication ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Epithelium Part ', ' Epithelium ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Faculty ', ' oviduct ', ' Uterine Tubes ', ' Salpinx ', ' Fallopian Tubes ', ' Mammalian Oviducts ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' blood cell formation ', ' Hematopoietic Cellular Control Mechanisms ', ' Hematopoiesis ', ' Hematopoietic Body System ', ' Hematologic Organ System ', ' Hematologic Body System ', ' Hematopoietic System ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' Immune system ', ' immuno therapy ', ' immune-based treatments ', ' immune-based therapies ', ' immune therapy ', ' immune therapeutic strategy ', ' immune therapeutic regimens ', ' immune therapeutic interventions ', ' immune therapeutic approach ', ' immune drugs ', ' Immunologically Directed Therapy ', ' Immunotherapy ', ' Institutes ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Leadership ', ' Learning ', ' acute myeloid leukemia ', ' acute granulocytic leukemia ', ' Acute Myelogenous Leukemia ', ' Acute Myeloblastic Leukemia ', ' AML -

"High-Throughput Functional Genomics to Guide Precision Oncology in Gastrointestinal Tumors Abstract:  This is an application for a K22 award for Dr. John Paul Shen, a medical oncologist currently at the University of California, San Diego. Dr. Shen is establishing himself as a young translational investigator in the field of cancer genomics. This K22 award will provide Dr. Shen with the resources and training to accomplish the following objectives; (1) implement advanced computational methods on genome scale datasets (2) become an expert in functional genomics, (3) achieve proficiency experimenting in mouse models of cancer, (4) successfully manage an independent laboratory. To achieve these objectives, after accepting a faculty position Dr. Shen will assemble a diverse advisory committee including experts in bioinformatics, experimental cancer biology, and clinical oncology.  It was proposed by many that the ability to sequence a tumor genome, now made possible by next- generation sequencing, would bring about a new era of precision oncology in which chemotherapy choices would be individualized to match a single tumor and patient. However, the use genomic information in clinical practice remains limited by the fact that currently very few mutations are associated with response to a specific drug. This is particularly true in Gastrointestinal (GI) malignancies, where there are few targeted therapy options and few effective biomarkers help guide chemotherapy selection. Dr. Shen seeks to address this pressing need by employing high-throughput functional genomic methods to identify tumor specific vulnerabilities that could be exploited therapeutically.  Recognizing that there will be great heterogeneity from one tumor to the next, even within the same cancer type, the functional genomic data created here will be combined with systems biology methods to identify how the vulnerabilities of each unique tumor can be predicted with information readily available to a clinical oncologist. Using network-based machine learning methods applied to chemo-genomic viability data in molecularly characterize cell lines it is expected that predictive biomarkers will be identified for both novel targeted agents and currently used chemotherapy drugs. This will allow oncologists to design individualized chemotherapy regimens for each patient. Project Narrative  Although the development of targeted anti-cancer therapies has had a major impact on many tumor types, there is currently a lack of effective targeted drugs for patients with cancers of the Gastrointestinal (GI) tract. This proposal seeks to address this pressing need by using novel high-throughput functional genomic methods to identify tumor specific vulnerabilities that could be exploited therapeutically.

"An Academic-Industry Partnership to Advance Functional Genomics for Personalized Oncology. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Oregon Health & Science University and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center have worked over the past decade to develop ex vivo drug profiling to guide a rationale decision-making in assigning drugs to cancer patients, thereby improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs. A number of recent breakthroughs, many developed through our partnership, have dramatically improved on nearly all aspects of ex vivo drug testing. Our work to date has led to numerous compassionate-use cases as well as new investigator initiated clinical trials. Recognizing the broad utility for a clinic-friendly ex vivo drug sensitivity platform, we set up a commercial entity, SEngine Precision Medicine, whose mission is to provide functional testing of patient derived tumor cells for research, clinical studies, and drug development. Here we seek to move beyond proof of concept in the assay toward wider adoption by cancer research centers, community hospitals, and individual users. We will benchmark the assay’s predictive performance in both “N of 1” settings and in prospective observational studies, and use this baseline performance to drive the development of methods to further improve its predictive value. We will continue to optimize drug selection by integrating ex vivo drug testing with patient specific genomic profiling and clinical data. In parallel, we will develop a reporting system, based upon requirements analysis, for potential end users such as clinicians and academic research centers. OHSU will provide expertise in precision medicine for AML, functional testing of primary leukemia cells, and clinical trials and will assist with assay optimization. FHCRC will provide expertise in functional testing of cells derived from solid tumors, focusing first on breast cancer, cancer genomics, and clinical trials; and will assist with assay optimization and benchmarking. SEngine will develop CLIA certified assays, optimize sample analysis workflows, and develop a reporting system for end users. All three sites will work together to demonstrate inter-institutional proficiency of the assays. At least five additional academic centers have agreed to provide patient derived tumor cells for this project and we anticipate this number will increase during the granting period. The partnering institutions will also provide essential feedback for our performance and reporting system. Our end goals for this project are to produce a refined functional genomic platform based on ex vivo drug screens, a user-friendly reporting interface, and adoption of the technology in the clinical care decision-making process. PROJECT NARRATIVE The ability to provide effective therapy recommendations to cancer patients is limited by our capacity to predict which drugs will work for a given patient. Our platform overcomes this limitation by testing a set of available anti- cancer drugs on tumor cells cultured directly from cancer patients. Through an extensive academic/industry partnership, we propose to refine and benchmark this platform, improve its predictive power, and provide a user- friendly reporting interface to facilitate its adoption by cancer care providers.  ",An Academic-Industry Partnership to Advance Functional Genomics for Personalized Oncology.,9613231,R01CA214428,"['Adoption ', ' Antineoplastic Agents ', ' anticancer drug ', ' anticancer agent ', ' anti-cancer drug ', ' Tumor-Specific Treatment Agents ', ' Neoplastic Disease Chemotherapeutic Agents ', ' Cancer Drug ', ' Antineoplastics ', ' Antineoplastic Drugs ', ' Anti-Cancer Agents ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Certification ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Decision Making ', ' Customized Drugs ', ' Designer Drugs ', ' Drug Combinations ', ' Pharmaceutical Industry ', ' Pharmaceutic Industry ', ' Drug Industry ', ' resistant to Drug ', ' resistance to Drug ', ' drug resistant ', ' Drug resistance ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Economics ', ' Feedback ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Community Hospitals ', ' acute myeloid leukemia ', ' acute granulocytic leukemia ', ' Acute Myelogenous Leukemia ', ' Acute Myeloblastic Leukemia ', ' AML -

"Regulators of Cancer Immunotherapy Response PROJECT SUMMARY Despite enormous success in treating several types of cancer, immune checkpoint blocker (ICB) therapy still only shows efficacies in a subset of patients. Identifying novel regulators of immunotherapy response as well as improving the response rate of cancer immunotherapies remain open questions. Recently, we used CRISPR screens in mouse models to investigate T-cell infiltration, proliferation, and killing efficacy, and identified PBAF of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex as one novel regulator of T-cell mediated cytotoxicity. We also developed a computational model, TIDE, to identify gene signatures of CD8 T-cell dysfunction in immune hot tumors and T-cell exclusion in immune cold tumors. The resulting signatures, computed from tumor profiles in non-immunotherapy setting, show promising results in predicting melanoma and lung cancer patient response to immune checkpoint blockade based on pre-treatment tumor expression profiles. This proposed project aims to improve the TIDE biomarkers, identify novel regulators, and elucidate their mechanisms underlying ICB response. In Aim 1, we will develop machine learning approaches on large collection of clinical tumor transcriptome profiles from non-ICB settings to refine the TIDE predictive biomarker of ICB response, and develop a web server to comprehensively evaluate different ICB response biomarkers in all the available ICB cohorts. In Aim 2, we will conduct in vivo CRISPR screens in mouse syngeneic tumor models to identify cancer-cell intrinsic regulators of ICB response, which can serve as novel targets to improve ICB response. In Aim 3, we will elucidate the mechanism underlying two novel regulators of ICB response and characterize their effects on the tumor immune microenvironment using single-cell RNA-seq, single-cell ATAC- seq, and computational modeling. Our investigative team has combined expertise in computational methodology immunotherapy. immunology and big data mining, functional genomics profiling Our proposed studies, if successfully executed, and translational benefits to cancer immunotherapy. and screening, cancer immunology and could provide new insights into cancer PROJECT NARRATIVE Cancer immunotherapies have emerged over the last decade as highly promising approaches for cancer treatment, although only subsets of patients respond to immunotherapies.

"Molecular Mechanisms of Large Oncosome-Induced Prostate Cancer Progression and Metastasis Abstract Prostate cancer (PC) is one of the most frequent tumors in men. Despite recent progress, the disease is still incurable once resistance to castration therapy occurs. Tumor progression is strongly mediated by altered molecular exchanges between cancer cells and the surrounding milieu that originate at the primary sites. However, the mechanisms regulating the response of the stroma to the tumor, which ultimately promote PC progression are still largely unknown. Our laboratory discovered a new type of tumor-derived extracellular vesicle (EV), which are referred to as “large oncosomes” (LO), can harbor more abundant molecular cargo that is distinct and more potently bioactive than that carried by exosomes. The rationale for this proposal derives from our preliminary observations in patients that LO abundance in the circulation correlates with PC progression. Our functional data demonstrate that LO can activate oncogenic signaling in fibroblasts, which respond to LO uptake by activating MYC and SPI1 and by induce a transcriptional program that promotes angiogenesis and stimulates tumor growth. The overarching goal of this project is to determine the functional role of LO in PC progression and metastasis. We hypothesize that LO functionally reprogram normal prostate-associated fibroblasts (NAF) toward a phenotype that is driven by MYC and SPI1 activation. These results strongly suggest that tumor-derived LO might activate intercellular responses that are specific to this subtype of extracellular vesicle. Our hypothesis will be tested with three Specific Aims: Aim 1: To investigate the role of LO-induced fibroblast activation in PC progression. Aim 2: To find evidence that the LO- induced transcriptional program is active in PC patients with clinically significant disease. Aim 3: To test if LO and/or Exo derived from PC patient and PDX specimens promote castration resistance and/or bone metastasis. We will use a combination of complementary in vitro and animal orthotopic models as well as focused approaches involving genome editing, molecular barcodes, and a Cre-Lox reporter in vivo system. Our study will determine if the transcriptional program induced by LO in vitro drives tumor progression and metastasis in vivo. Additionally we will determine if this transcriptional program can also be identified in patient specimens and if it indicative of tumor progression. Finally, our study will provide evidence for LO abilities to induce metastasis of indolent PC cells. PROJECT NARRATIVE In this project we will perform functional tests of a newly-identified class of tumor-derived extracellular vesicle, referred to as large oncosomes. These shed vesicles are products of metastatic prostate cancer cells and we have obtained evidence that they are potent effectors of conditioning of the tumor microenvironment in a manner that promotes disease progression. Here we will examine their potential role in stroma-supported tumor progression and metastasis and the novel molecular mechanisms underlying this process.",Molecular Mechanisms of Large Oncosome-Induced Prostate Cancer Progression and Metastasis,9840425,R01CA234557,"['Animals ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood Circulation ', ' Circulation ', ' Bloodstream ', ' Bone Marrow ', ' Bone Marrow Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Surgical Castration ', ' Castration ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Endothelium ', ' Fibroblasts ', ' Foundations ', ' gene deletion mutation ', ' Gene Deletion ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' In Vitro ', ' Laboratories ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Morphogenesis ', ' tumor cell metastasis ', ' cancer metastasis ', ' Secondary Tumor ', ' Secondary Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Tumor ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Mass ', ' Metastatic Lesion ', ' Metastasize ', ' Metastasis ', ' Neoplasm Metastasis ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma ', ' Play ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Prostate ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Metastatic to ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Work ', ' Mediating ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm to the Bone ', ' bone neoplasm secondary ', ' Skeletal metastasis ', ' Secondary malignant neoplasm of bone ', ' Secondary malignancy of bone ', ' Secondary cancer of bone ', ' Osseous metastasis ', ' Metastatic malignant neoplasm to bone ', ' Metastatic Tumor to the Bone ', ' Metastatic Cancer to the Bone ', ' Metastasis to bone ', ' Bony metastasis ', ' Bone cancer metastatic ', ' Bone Metastasis ', ' base ', ' tumor progression ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' cancer progression ', ' Site ', ' Solid ', ' Clinical ', ' Malignant -

"Multimodal Biomarkers For Oropharyngeal Cancer Abstract Head and neck cancers are the fifth most common cancer type in the United States, with an overall survival rate lower than 50%. Although the incidence of other sub-sites of head and neck cancer has decreased steadily in past decades, the number of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) cases has increased significantly. Most OPSCC patients receive standard cancer therapy.4 However, the clinical outcomes vary significantly and are difficult to predict. Predicting early in treatment whether a tumor is likely to respond to treatment is one of the most difficult yet important tasks in providing individualized cancer care.  Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a known driving oncogenic factor in oropharyngeal cancer, as well as a significant prognostic biomarker for patient survival. Retrospective studies conducted by the International Head and Neck Cancer Epidemiology Consortium (INHANCE) have demonstrated that clinical biomarkers have prognostic value in helping stratify OPSCC patients into groups with differing risks of death or disease progression. However, HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer patients have similar rates of metastatic spread to HPV-negative patients. The same is true for patient groups stratified with other clinical biomarkers. More robust prognostic biomarkers are needed to accurately stratify patients for optimally effective treatment.  MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of small non-coding RNA molecules that collectively control the expression of thousands of protein-coding genes. Multiple studies indicate that miRNAs are promising cancer biomarkers and play critical regulatory roles in oropharyngeal cancer. Imaging features extracted from medical images are an exciting new class of cancer biomarkers for characterizing tumor habitats. For several tumor sites, imaging biomarkers have shown promise in accurately separating favorable and unfavorable prognosis patients. However, current efforts to utilize high-dimensional multimodal biomarkers for treatment outcome prediction have been compromised by small patient numbers relative to the feature space dimensionality; feature redundancy, heterogeneity, and uncertainty; and patient cohorts with unbalanced outcomes. The correlation, independence, and complementary nature of multimodal biomarkers (imaging, miRNA, HPV, clinical, and histopathologic biomarkers) remains unexplored as well.  The major goal of this research is to develop a multimodal biomarker-based model that can reliably predict subsets of OPSCC patients with low and high risks for treatment failure. The model will serve as a clinical decision-making tool. Specifically, we propose a novel principle and systematic machine learning-based strategy to effectively identify and seamlessly combine prognostic information carried by multimodal biomarkers. Aim 1: Identify prognostic multimodal biomarkers, given OPSCC patient data. Aim 2: Develop and test a comprehensive multimodal biomarker-based model for predicting OPSCC treatment outcomes. Aim 3: Assess the clinical benefit of the model for OPSCC patient stratification and individualized treatment. Narrative The achievement of this project forms a basis of combining non-invasive imaging biomarkers with miRNAs, HPV, clinical, and histopathologic biomarkers for accurate cancer prognosis and discovering the correlation with genetic mechanisms leading to specific tumor phenotypes. This clinical decision-making tool can provide useful information to support patient stratification and individualized treatment. We anticipate that many of the methodological improvements established in this proposal will improve oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma treatment and tumor response assessment and treatment in other disease sites as well.",Multimodal Biomarkers For Oropharyngeal Cancer,9818602,R01CA233873,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Decision Making ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Incidence ', ' wart virus ', ' Infectious Human Wart Virus ', ' Human Papilloma Virus ', ' HPV ', ' Human Papillomavirus ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methodology ', ' oral pharyngeal neoplasm ', ' Oropharynx Tumor ', ' Oropharynx Neoplasms ', ' Oropharyngeal Tumor ', ' Oropharyngeal Neoplasms ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Retrospective Studies ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' malignant oropharynx neoplasm ', ' malignant oropharynx tumor ', ' Oropharynx Carcinoma ', ' Oropharynx Cancer ', ' Oropharyngeal Carcinoma ', ' Oropharyngeal Cancer ', ' Oropharnyx Cancers ', ' Malignant Oropharyngeal Tumor ', ' Malignant Oropharyngeal Neoplasm ', ' Treatment Failure ', ' therapy failure ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' prognostic ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Head and Neck Cancer ', ' malignant head and neck tumor ', ' Malignant Head and Neck Neoplasm ', ' Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma ', ' oropharynx squamous cell carcinoma ', ' oropharynx epidermoid carcinoma ', ' Oropharyngeal Epidermoid Carcinoma ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Dimensions ', ' Techniques ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Habitats ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Functional RNA ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer epidemiology ', ' MicroRNAs ', ' miRNAs ', ' miRNA ', ' Micro RNA ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Prognostic Marker ', ' prognostic indicator ', ' prognostic biomarker ', ' Prognosis Marker ', ' Molecular Marker of Prognosis ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Cancer Prognosis ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' trial treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' Validation ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' Outcome ', ' cancer type ', ' Oncogenic ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' tumor ', ' high risk ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' treatment strategy ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' non-invasive imaging ', ' noninvasive imaging ', ' precision oncology ', ' precision cancer medicine ', ' precision cancer care ', ' personalized oncology ', ' individualized cancer care ', ' individualized medicine ', ' unique treatment ', ' tailored treatment ', ' tailored therapy ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' individualized treatment ', ' individualized therapy ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' customized treatment ', ' customized therapy ', ' prognostic value ', ' prognostic utility ', ' prognostic power ', ' imaging biomarker ', ' imaging-based marker ', ' imaging-based biomarker ', ' imaging-based biological marker ', ' imaging marker ', ' patient stratification ', ' stratified patient ', ' cancer biomarkers ', ' cancer markers ', ' clinical biomarkers ', ' clinically useful biomarkers ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' patient biomarkers ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subtypes ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subgroups ', ' microRNA biomarkers ', ' microRNA markers ', ' miRNA markers ', ' miRNA biomarkers ', ' high dimensionality ', ' mortality risk ', ' death risk ', ' Patient imaging ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R01,2019,419721,IL-13,0.08411500308422826
"Dissecting Therapeutic Resistance and Progression in Metastatic Melanoma Through Clinical Computational Oncology Project Summary  The development of targeted therapy (BRAF/MEKi) and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) targeting the co-inhibitory receptors CTLA-4 and PD-1 have revolutionized the treatment of metastatic melanoma. However, only a subset of patients maintain durable responses, and many people experience substantial side effects of therapy. Predicting therapeutic response in individual patients remains a critical and unresolved issue. Furthermore, the series of key genomic and epigenetic events driving progression and resistance to therapy is incompletely understood. The guiding hypothesis of this proposal is that (a) resistance to ICB and targeted therapy is mediated by tumor intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms, some of which may be elucidated by systematic multi-modal molecular characterization of the tumor and tumor microenvironment; and (b) applying modern machine-learning and statistical approaches to molecular and clinical data from patient tumors will inform development of new therapeutic approaches and predictive models to improve patient care.  Identifying and validating predictors of intrinsic resistance to BRAF/MEKi and ICB across large human cohorts has been limited to date. Aim 1 of this proposal applies genomic and transcriptomic characterization of pre-treatment tumors to large cohorts of patients treated with BRAF/MEKi, PD-1i, and CTLA-4i in order to discover and to validate molecular and clinical markers of response and resistance. Machine learning approaches will integrate these markers into parsimonious models predicting response. A differential analysis using mutual information will be conducted to reveal markers that predict differential response to therapy.  A significant proportion of patients do not respond or maintained sustained responses to immunotherapy, and there is a critical need to characterize the acquisition or selection of drivers that confer resistance to immunotherapy. Aim 2 of this proposal develops algorithms using molecular characterization of longitudinally collected tumor samples across multiple anatomic sites to discover genomic and epigenetic drivers of progression and resistance to immunotherapy using phylogenetic analysis as the backbone of discovery.  Finally, the ability to detect novel tumor driver mutations present at low frequencies is strongly dependent on cohort size. Aim 3 of this proposal leverages all genomically characterized melanomas to perform a meta- analysis using state-of-the-art and novel algorithms to discover novel driver mutations present at low frequencies with a focus on tumor subsets that lack known targetable drivers.  These studies will expand the actionable landscape of genomic and epigenetic alterations in metastatic melanoma, advance our understanding of intrinsic and acquired resistance to targeted and immunotherapies in melanoma, and establish a framework to predict response in individual patients, which may impact patient care in melanoma and have applicability in other disease settings. Project Narrative  New targeted and immunotherapies have revolutionized the treatment and extended the prognosis of metastatic melanoma, but only a subset of patients have durable responses, and our ability to predict who will benefit from which treatment is limited. Further, the specific alterations driving tumor progression and resistance to therapy are not well characterized, but may inform the development of new therapeutic targets and combination therapies. This proposal aims to integrate molecular data from patient tumor samples and their clinical context to predict response to targeted and immunotherapies, and dissect the drivers of progression and

"Quantitative (Perfusion and Diffusion) MRI Biomarkers to Measure Glioma Response Abstract  The continuing goal of our research program is to optimize and disseminate effective imaging-based strategies to personalize brain tumor treatment. Current Response Assessment in NeuroOncology (RANO) criteria, which incorporate anatomic imaging only, are insufficient for distinguishing tumor from treatment effect (TE). Without definitive confirmation of tumor progression, no treatment changes are recommended for several months after standard therapies. Thus, patients are precluded from switching to potentially more effective therapies—a limitation that could be overcome with more reliable imaging techniques.  To this end, during the previous funding cycle, we demonstrated the feasibility of several quantitative imaging (QI) tools to reliably distinguish tumor from treatment effect and predict treatment response. These QI tools include a machine-learning approach to calibrate T1w images enabling the creation of quantitative delta T1 (qDT1) maps. The qDT1 enable the detection of true contrast enhancing lesion volume (CELV). The qDT1 together with our proven dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) MRI methods, for determination of rCBV (relative cerebral blood volume), are used to generate a new biomarker, fractional tumor burden (FTB), to delineate the extent of tumor within CELV on a voxel-wise basis. These perfusion-based QI tools in combination with our diffusion MRI technology, which includes functional diffusion maps (FDMs) and more recently RSI (restriction spectrum imaging), provide a comprehensive assessment of brain tumor and its distinction from treatment effect.  Now, in order to translate this technology for use in clinical trials and daily practice, some final updates and clinical validation studies are needed as proposed here. First, to ease adoption and testing in the clinical setting improvements are proposed for the individual QI technologies along with the development of a streamlined workflow (Aim 1). To improve the widespread adoption of DSC-MRI and FTB biomarker, studies will be performed to confirm that a single-dose DSC-MRI method can replace the standard double-dose method without affecting the accuracy of rCBV or the creation of FTB maps (Aim 1.1). Also, registration and segmentation algorithms will be updated to include deformable registration and recent advances in deep learning for longitudinal reporting of CELV, non-enhancing lesion volumes (NELV) and each of the QI metrics (Aim 1.2). Finally, a streamlined workflow that incorporates these improvements will be created (Aim 1.3). The Aim 2 studies will test the QI tools and workflow using clinical trial data (Aim 2.1-2.2) and daily clinical practice (Aim 2.3-2.4).  Clinical validation of this new QI-RANO workflow, with evidence showing improved prediction in comparison to current measures, has the potential to cause a paradigm shift in how brain tumor burden is assessed. Project Narrative The goal of our research program is to optimize and disseminate effective quantitative imaging (QI)-based strategies to provide earlier indications of brain tumor treatment response than is currently available. The QI tools, which include novel quantitative measures of enhancing lesion (qDT1), relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV), fractional tumor burden (FTB) and functional diffusion maps (fDM) will be updated and validated in the context of clinical trials.

"Integrating Radiomics into S0819 and Lung-MAP, Biomarker Driven Clinical Trials for Lung Cancer The goal of this research is to clinically translate software tools we developed through the Quantitative Imaging Network and validate their ability to assess the response of cancer in clinical trials. Current RECIST response criteria are inadequate to detect tumor changes in targeted molecular therapy and immunotherapies, two of the most promising avenues for drug discovery. We hypothesize that innovative volumetric and radiomics signatures of response and progression, identified using our quantitative CT imaging tools, can be integrated into clinical trial workflow to meet the urgent need for alternatives to RECIST criteria. Two large multi-site trials present a unique opportunity to test this hypothesis in one disease treated with multiple therapeutic options driven by tissue biomarkers. S0819 is a completed Phase III trial with 1300+ patients and Lung- MAP (S1400) is an ongoing first-of-its-kind Phase II/III model projected to enroll up to 5,000 patients using a multi-drug, targeted screening approach to match patients with sub-studies testing investigational treatments based on their unique tumor profiles. Aim 1 tests whether change in tumor volume over time, measured by our advanced volumetric segmentation algorithms, outperforms unidimensional RECIST 1.1 response criteria. Aim 2 correlates genomic mutations identified in S0819 and Lung-MAP with radiomics signatures constructed by our machine learning models, with the goal of developing a non-invasive, easily repeatable virtual biopsy through CT imaging. Aim 3 validates the prediction of clinical outcomes using early biomarkers of response and progression based on quantitative CT-based radiomic features, hypothesized to outperform both RECIST and volumetrics alone across therapeutic options including chemotherapies, targeted molecular agents, and immune checkpoint blockade. Our work has substantial health significance because validation of volume and radiomic changes as early biomarkers of response or progression will guide clinical trials for drug discovery and help match patients to personalized treatment. Response criteria developed through this study will be widely applicable to clinical practice because CT is the most common cancer imaging modality and the quantitative image analysis tools can easily be incorporated into existing popular imaging platforms and clinical workflow, reducing the time required by radiologists. Data from this project, including anonymized imaging data (CT for all patients and PET for a large subset), clinical meta- data, and lesion mark-ups by independent radiologists, will be shared for use by other researchers through the TCGA Cancer Imaging Archive, continuing an extensive history of data sharing by this team. This work will improve drug discovery for promising new classes of therapies by creating innovative response criteria based on volumetric and radiomics signatures developed with prior support by the QIN and now validated in two large multi-site clinical trials studying multiple therapeutic options in the most important histologic types of lung cancer and most commonly used imaging modality, CT. Results are expected to be applied to other tumor types and help match patients to the treatment that works best for them.","Integrating Radiomics into S0819 and Lung-MAP, Biomarker Driven Clinical

"Development and Dissemination of KiNet: A Novel Imaging Informatics Tool for Gastrointestinal and Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors PROJECT SUMMARY Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are one heterogeneous type of cancer affecting most organ systems. NETs must be correctly graded to ensure proper treatment and patient management. The proliferation index, as measured by Ki67 nuclear staining, is required for gastrointestinal (GI) and pancreatic NET grading per the criteria of the World Health Organization (WHO). Measuring the Ki67 labeling index (Ki67 LI) from pathology images requires accurate quantification of immunopositive tumor, immunonegative tumor and non-tumor cells. This process is an essential procedure in basic, translational and clinical research and in routine clinical practice. However, current Ki67 image analysis tools have a number of drawbacks: 1) Ki67 LI assessment is still mainly achieved with manual or semi-automated methods, leading to increased labor costs, awkward workflows, low-throughput image analysis and significant potential inter- and intra-observer variability; 2) computer-aided Ki67 counting is error-prone due to the multi-stage image processing design, where each stage itself is a very challenging task; 3) current algorithm design does not take into consideration the characteristics of Ki67 images such that it has technical difficulty in classifying different types of cells in Ki67 stained images. In this proposed research, we seek to develop and disseminate a novel deep learning-based imaging informatics system, KiNeT, specifically for better automated Ki67 LI measurement in GI and pancreatic NETs. KiNet will take advantage of cutting-edge machine learning algorithms, deep fully convolutional networks (FCNs), to develop an end-to-end, pixel-to-pixel model for single-stage Ki67 LI assessment. To this end, we will first formulate Ki67 counting as a cell identification problem and solve it using class-aware structured regression modeling within a novel FCN network. This network will simultaneously detect and classify immunopositive tumor, immunonegative tumor and non-tumor cells. Next, we will further enhance cell identification with another related task, extraction of regions of interest (ROIs), which will differentiate tumor from non-tumor regions by taking Ki67 image characteristics into consideration. These two tasks will be unified into one single neural network and jointly learned to benefit both cell identification and region classification. KiNet will provide a novel computational method for accurate Ki67 LI assessment, thereby enabling early detection and targeted treatments of the diseases. Compared to manual counting and current Ki67 image analysis methods, it will significantly improve the objectivity, consistency, reliability, reproducibility and efficiency. Additionally, the proposed single-stage Ki67 counting strategy, which is completely different from current multi-stage Ki67 image analysis pipelines, will provide a new perspective for Ki67 image quantification. PROJECT NARRATIVE Ki67 labeling index (LI) is a reliable and critical biomarker to grade gastrointestinal (GI) and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). This biomarker computation requires accurate quantification of immunopositive tumor, immunonegative tumor and non-tumor cells.

"Systems biology modeling of radiation resistance and chemotherapy-radiation combination therapies in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma Tumor resistance to radiation therapy remains a significant obstacle to long-term cancer patient survival, especially for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), a cancer type with poor long-term outcomes (less than 50% advanced stage five-year survival). To overcome the problem of radiation resistance, radiation therapy is being combined with radiation-sensitizing chemotherapies. Prediction of an individual’s sensitivity to radiation and specific chemotherapy-radiation combination therapies prior to treatment would improve the development of personalized treatment plans for cancer patients. Efforts are being made to create systems biology models of cancer cells for biomarker discovery and prediction of treatment response; however, due to methodological shortcomings, failure to integrate multi-omic data on a genome-scale, and lack of specificity to individual patient tumors, these predictive models have yet to be implemented clinically. To address these needs, the objective of this project is to develop a personalized systems biology modeling platform for individualized prediction of HNSCC patient tumor response to radiation and chemotherapy-radiation combination therapies. These models will be created by first integrating comprehensive biological data on individual patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). This approach will allow for the comparison of metabolic, signaling, and phenotypic signatures between radiation-sensitive and radiation-resistant patient tumors. By then integrating the mechanisms of action of radiation therapy and radiation-sensitizing chemotherapies into the modeling framework, the response to particular chemotherapy-radiation combination therapies in individual radiation- resistant patient tumors can be predicted. Machine learning classifiers will be developed from TCGA patient data and model predictions to determine which biological and clinical factors are most predictive of radiation sensitivity and chemotherapy-radiation combination therapy success. It is hypothesized that differential response to chemotherapy-radiation combination therapies in radiation-resistant HNSCC tumors is accomplished through redox metabolism and signaling, and components of redox biology within the modeling framework will significantly enrich the list of predictive biomarkers for combination therapy success. Although the focus of this project will be on HNSCC, this systems biology modeling approach will be applicable to any cancer type. The outcomes of this project will be a reduced set of clinically-measurable biomarkers for accurate prediction of HNSCC patient response to radiation therapy and specific chemotherapy-radiation combination therapies, as well as a precision medicine platform to test clinically relevant therapeutic strategies. This project is innovative because it combines multi-omic cancer patient data with state-of-the-art systems biology modeling techniques to investigate the biological mechanisms of radiation resistance, as well as to predict chemotherapy-radiation combination therapy response in individual radiation-resistant patients. Combination therapies that include both radiation and chemotherapy are currently being developed for cancer patients that do not respond well to radiation therapy alone. This research will provide insights into why particular head and neck cancer patients do not respond well to radiation therapy, as well as predict which chemotherapy- radiation combination treatments will be most effective for individual patients. Findings from this research will improve our ability to develop personalized treatment plans for cancer patients, which will decrease healthcare costs and improve patient outcomes.",Systems biology

"Clinical Translation of Stimulated Raman Histology Accurate intraoperative tissue diagnosis is central to medical decision making during brain tumor surgery. Existing intraoperative histologic techniques deplete scant tissue biopsies, introduce freezing artifacts, and rely on highly- skilled technicians and neuropathologists working in dedicated surgical pathology laboratories to produce and interpret slides. In addition, the number of centers where brain tumor surgery is performed far exceeds the number of board-certified neuropathologists, eliminating the possibility for expert consultation in many cases. Even in the most advanced, well-staffed hospitals, turnaround time for intraoperative pathology poses a major barrier for the efficient delivery of surgical care, highlighting the need for an improved system for rapid diagnosis. Stimulated Raman histology (SRH) creates high-resolution digital microscopic images of unprocessed tissue specimens in a fraction of the time of conventional techniques and eliminates reliance on a frozen section laboratory for sectioning, staining, mounting and reviewing slides. While SRH has been shown to reveal key diagnostic histologic features in brain tumor specimens, major technical hurdles related to laser safety and performance have hindered its clinical translation. The existing academic-industrial partnership between established collaborators has resulted in the development and initial validation of a clinically-compatible SRH microscope in a patient care setting (Nature Biomedical Engineering 1:0027, 2017). We have demonstrated that SRH has diagnostic value comparable to conventional histologic techniques and that SRH images are well-suited for interpretation via an automated machine learning algorithm. The proposed research program represents a multi-disciplinary (neurosurgery, neuropathology, biostatistics, computer science and medical device manufacturing) academic-industry partnership to accelerate the development of an SRH imager for use during brain tumor surgery. The overall goal of the partnership is to create pathways for online collaboration between surgeons and pathologists using the SRH imager, provide strong evidence for the utility of SRH in the setting of a prospective randomized controlled trial and to enhance our capabilities for automated intraoperative diagnosis employing state-of the-art image classification methods including convolutional neural networks. Once completed, this research program will improve the care of brain tumor patients by streamlining the process for intraoperative diagnosis. It will also create a pathway for remote and automated diagnosis, extending expertise in neuropathology to more centers caring for brain tumor patients. SRH technology combined with algorithms for automated intraoperative diagnosis create the possibility of advancing the larger field of surgical oncology where histologic information is essential for making surgical decisions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Existing techniques for creating histologic images of tissue during surgery are time-consuming, prone to error, may complicate diagnosis and surgical-decision making. We have developed an optical imaging technology which streamlines tissue diagnosis during surgery, enabling a uniform workflow that will improve the care of cancer patients. Through this academic-industrial partnership of successful collaborators, we aim to accumulate data which will propel this emerging technology towards becoming the new standard of care for intraoperative histology.",Clinical Translation of Stimulated Raman Histology,9980576,R01CA226527,"['Algorithms ', ' Archives ', ' Biomedical Engineering ', ' bioengineering ', ' bio-engineers ', ' bio-engineered ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biopsy ', ' Brain Neoplasms ', ' tumors in the brain ', ' Brain Tumors ', ' Brain Neoplasia ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Consultations ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diagnostic Imaging ', ' Freezing ', ' Freeze Sectioning ', ' Frozen Sections ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Goals ', ' Histological Technics ', ' Histologic Techniques ', ' Histologic Technics ', ' Histological Techniques ', ' Histology ', ' Hospitals ', ' intra-operative care ', ' Peroperative Care ', ' Intraoperative Care ', ' Laboratories ', ' Laser Radiation ', ' Laser Electromagnetic ', ' Lasers ', ' Medical Device ', ' Methods ', ' neurosurgery ', ' Operating Rooms ', ' Pathology ', ' Surgical Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Safety ', ' Staining method ', ' Stains ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Measures ', ' Artifacts ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' Microscope ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Histologic ', ' Histologically ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Collaborations ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Pathologist ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' Specimen ', ' Research Specimen ', ' programs ', ' Slide ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' Medical center ', ' Surgeon ', ' American ', ' Performance ', ' rapid diagnosis ', ' diagnostic accuracy ', ' Accuracy of Diagnosis ', ' computer science ', ' Structure ', ' neuropathology ', ' cancer care ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Surgical Oncology ', ' oncologic surgery ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Emerging Technologies ', ' Emergent Technologies ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Output ', ' optical imaging ', ' optic imaging ', ' virtual ', ' digital ', ' Imaging technology ', ' prospective ', ' Consumption ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' graphical user interface ', ' graphic user interface ', ' Graphical interface ', ' neuro-oncology ', ' neurooncology ', ' standard of care ', ' industry partner ', ' industry partnership ', ' industrial partnership ', ' imaging system ', ' Tissue imaging ', ' microscopic imaging ', ' microscopy imaging ', ' microscope imaging ', ' histological image ', ' histologic image ', ' clinical translation ', ' imager ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' ConvNet ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine ', ' DICOM ', ' ']",NCI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,524967,NY-12,0.1130551632498513
"Single-cell characterization of tumor and microenvironment co-evolution in Peripheral T-cell Lymphomas Project Summary Tumor and microenvironment constitute complex ecologies involving a multitude of stromal cells, immune cells, and in some cases coexisting microbes. A paradigmatic example of complex tumor-microenvironment interactions are peripheral T-cell lymphomas, aggressive and genetically complex tumors where tumor cells often constitute a minority cell population. Peripheral T-cell lymphomas are frequently associated with the presence of Epstein-Barr virus whose role in the disease remains largely uncharacterized. We have shown that the presence of specific macrophage populations and viral transcriptional programs are associated to survival. But, how do tumor and microenvironment coevolve and inform prognosis? Our project goal is to characterize the tumor- microenvironment interactions and coevolution in peripheral T-cell lymphomas using large collections of human transcriptomic data and longitudinal single-cell sequencing data from recently developed mouse models. We will develop an approach based on random matrix theory and topological data analysis for modelling the continuous aspect of tumor microenvironment evolution. We will further deploy our lab-developed methodology for in silico pathogen detection to study the interactions between the Epstein-Barr virus and peripheral T-cell lymphoma lymphomagenesis and progression. Successful completion of our goals will provide a general, experimentally validated strategy to uncover the dynamical nature of tumor-microenvironment interactions at the single-cell resolution in tumor types with complex stromal component. Additionally, our approach will help uncover new microenvironment driven targets supporting lymphoma cell growth, with potential therapeutic implications for the treatment of this deadly disease. Narrative Tumor and microenvironment coexist and coevolve determining clinical outcomes.

"Precision lung cancer therapy design through multiplexed adapter measurement Project Summary Combination therapy holds considerable promise for overcoming intrinsic and acquired resistance to targeted therapies but will rely on our ability to precisely identify the best drug combination for particular tumors. While immense focus exists on using genomic information to direct therapeutic approach, many resistance mechanisms do not rely on genetic changes and, in fact, can arise from entirely tumor-extrinsic factors within the microenvironment. For example, though the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) AXL is widely implicated in resistance to targeted therapies such as those directed against EGFR, its regulation by phosphatidylserine, as opposed to mutation, amplification or autocrine ligand, make identifying the tumors that will respond to AXL- targeted therapy especially challenging.  We propose to study both downstream and receptor-proximal signaling during bypass resistance mediated by AXL, and then across a wider panel of RTKs. Integrating these measurements with quantitative modeling will identify the connectivity between receptors, interacting adapters, and downstream signaling events, thereby defining the essential set of signaling network changes required for tumor cell survival in response to targeted therapeutics. We will then apply this understanding by measuring RTK-adapter interaction using proximity ligation to predict the RTKs driving bypass resistance and test these predictions in a panel of patient-derived xenograft tumors.  This work will considerably improve our ability to identify effective drug combinations by (a) developing a mechanism-based assay for identifying which among many RTKs tumor cells are relying upon for survival, (b) improving our basic understanding of exactly how network-level bypass resistance arises due to activation of non-targeted RTKs both at the receptor-proximal and downstream signaling layer, and (c) expanding our understanding of the RTK AXL with links to resistance, tumor spread, and immune avoidance. Project Narrative The proposed research is of immediate relevance to the public health mission of the NIH as it will considerably improve our understanding of resistance to targeted lung cancer therapies, which currently greatly limits their efficacy. This will focus development of new targeted drugs to overcome resistance, and optimize the application of therapy combinations for individual patients.",Precision lung cancer therapy design through multiplexed adapter measurement,9759874,U01CA215709,"['inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Cell Viability ', ' Cell Survival ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' multi-modal treatment ', ' multi-modal therapy ', ' combined treatment ', ' combined modality treatment ', ' combination therapy ', ' Multimodal Treatment ', ' Multimodal Therapy ', ' Combined Modality Therapy ', ' Drug Combinations ', ' Elements ', ' Ligands ', ' Closure by Ligation ', ' Ligation ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Statistical Models ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Serine Phosphoglycerides ', ' Phosphatidylserines ', ' Protein Phosphorylation ', ' Phosphorylation ', ' Proteins ', ' Public Health ', ' Complement Receptor ', ' proto-oncogene protein c-erbB-1 ', ' erbBl ', ' erbB-1 Proto-Oncogene Protein ', ' erbB-1 ', ' c-erbB-1 Protein ', ' c-erbB-1 ', ' Urogastrone Receptor ', ' Transforming Growth Factor alpha Receptor ', ' TGF-alpha Receptor ', ' HER1 ', ' Epidermal Growth Factor-Urogastrone Receptors ', ' Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinase ', ' Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Kinase ', ' ERBB Protein ', ' EGFR ', ' EGF Receptor ', ' Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' ufo receptor ', ' UFO oncogene protein ', ' Tyrosine-Protein Kinase Receptor UFO ', ' AXL Protein ', ' axl receptor tyrosine kinase ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases ', ' Tyrosine Kinase Receptors ', ' Tyrosine Kinase Linked Receptors ', ' Transmembrane Receptor Protein Tyrosine Kinase ', ' Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Gene ', ' PTK Receptors ', ' Link ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Measurement ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Immune ', ' Immunes ', ' Event ', ' Xenograft procedure ', ' xeno-transplantation ', ' xeno-transplant ', ' Xenotransplantation ', ' Xenograft ', ' Heterologous Transplantation ', ' Heterograft ', ' autocrine ', ' Autocrine Systems ', ' mutant ', ' neoplastic cell ', ' Tumor Cell ', ' receptor ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' receptor expression ', ' Bypass ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Genomics ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Adaptor Signaling Protein ', ' adapter protein ', ' Adaptor Signaling Protein Gene ', ' Adaptor Protein Gene ', ' Adaptor Protein ', ' RIPK1 gene ', ' Receptor-Interacting Serine/Threonine Kinase 1 ', ' Receptor-Interacting Protein ', ' RIPK1 ', ' RIP1 ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Receptor Activation ', ' in vivo ', ' resistance mechanism ', ' resistant mechanism ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' therapy resistant ', ' treatment resistance ', ' therapeutic resistance ', ' resistant to therapy ', ' resistance to therapy ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' tumor xenograft ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' tumor ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' novel therapy target ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' novel pharmacotherapy target ', ' novel druggable target ', ' novel drug target ', ' new therapy target ', ' new pharmacotherapy target ', ' new druggable target ', ' new drug target ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted therapy ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' individual patient ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,U01,2019,399937,CA-33,0.09113684963107378
"Engineering personalized micro-tumor ecosystems Abstract Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in the United States, accounting for near 1 in every 4 deaths. However, despite the recent development of subtype-specific personalized therapy based on achievements in the fields of molecular and genetic profiling, many cancer treatments still have low efficacy which mostly arise from the limited ability to predict the patient tumor responses to therapeutic agents. The major reason that current therapeutics often cannot translate into a successful clinical outcomes is because of the complex tumor microenvironment and heterogeneity that limit the predictive power of the biomarker-guided strategies for chemotherapy. Therefore, the successful engineering of personalized three-dimensional (3D) tumor ecosystem that can recapitulate the tumor microenvironment and heterogeneity in vitro is strongly desired to accurately predict patients’ responses to anti-cancer drugs and thus further improve patient outcome. Here we propose to develop a personalized breast-cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip platform for personalized screening of cancer chemotherapeutics with high accuracy by utilizing patient-derived tumor explant, defined tumor grade-matched biomaterial matrices and autologous patient serum to mimic patient-specific tumor hallmarks. The proposed cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip will also be tightly regulated under physiological fluid dynamics. In this project, we have hypothesized that 1) the use of tumor explant will embrace the critical components of the tumor heterogeneity of the patient, 2) the combination of defined tumor grade-matched matrix, autologous patient serum, and a microfluidic bioreactor will prevent the phenotype alteration of the tumor explant, and 3) the integration of a machine-learning algorithm with the cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip platform will provide more accurate, unbiased prediction of the patient responses to chemotherapeutics based on the data gathered from the engineered tumor model. Our preliminary results show that the combination of tumor explant culture and tumor-derived matrix constituents had predicted therapeutic responses with 100% sensitivity. Our preliminary results show high specificity throughout a range of cancers including breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and thus the findings can have broad applications, and can emerge as a paradigm shift in the management of cancer. Narrative Despite the recent development of subtype-specific personalized therapy based on achievements in the fields of molecular and genetic profiling, the cancer treatment still has low efficacy that mostly arise from the limited ability of existing models to recapitulate the tumor heterogeneity and therefore predict the patient tumor responses to therapeutic agents.

"Pathogenesis of the cART unresponsive Kaposi’s sarcoma tumor niche Abstract Kaposi's Sarcoma (KS) is the most common AIDS-defining cancer. Combined anti-retroviral therapy (cART) has greatly reduced KS-associated mortality among AIDS patients; however, a serous clinical problem exists in that up to 50% of HIV+KS+ patients in the United States and 61% in Sub-Saharan Africa never achieve complete remission even with chemotherapy and a reduction in HIV viral loads. No definitive study has identified if there are tumor-associated features or mechanisms are associated with cART-progressive KS (progressors) vs. the responder (responders) phenotype. Our study utilizes a robust pre-cART KS tissue collection (n = 224) from the ACSR that originated from the Antiretrovirals for Kaposi's Sarcoma (ARKS) clinical trial. 36% of ARKS participants experienced continued progression of KS despite a reduction in viral loads and restored T-cell counts, in contrast to the rest of the cohort who experienced a reduction or elimination of tumors by the 1-year trial endpoint. This application poses several hypotheses concerning the progressor phenotype: 1) prior to the initiation of cART, an increase in HIV and/or KSHV-infected immune cells enhances a stimulatory immunological profile in the progressor phenotype, 2) there are significant differences in the upregulation of KSHV lytic and immunomodulation genes, which stimulate increased immune cell recruitment into the pre-cART tumor microenvironment and promote tumor progression through cytokine-signaling inflammatory processes enhanced in part by the cART-revitalized immune system, 3) the highly inflammatory nature of KS tumors, comprising a complex mixture of immune cells with which to interact, selects for unique and/or elusive HIV genotypes, distinct from plasma HIV, that promote stimulatory processes to continue in the progressor phenotype. Our Specific Aims address these hypotheses using a combination of advanced immunohistochemistry, virus specific cellular localization (DNA and RNAscope), high-throughput gene expression analysis (RNAseq), and a novel deep sequencing approach applied to HIV. Innovations include the unprecedented amount pre-cART KS tumor material available for the study, advanced imagining technologies, in vivo KS tumors gene expression studies, the use of the newer PacBio SMRT sequencing approach applied to HIV, and machine-learning approaches that can define non-linear associations in complex data sets. This project will define the largest well-characterized set of combinatorial features related to cART-associated KS outcomes derived directly from KS-associated biomaterial. Identifying clinically relevant immune factors in the tumor niche pre-cART will pave the way for the development of future mechanistic studies on the functions of both viral and cellular genes that are involved in cART resistant tumor progression. Project Narrative Combined anti-retroviral therapy (cART) successfully reduces the risk of progressive Kaposi's sarcoma in the majority of HIV infected people; however, up to 50% of those treated will never retrieve remission, even when viral loads are reduced and the immune system is restored. In this project we will to determine the pre-cART tumor features that identify the progressor phenotype. With the ability to differentiate between the progressor and responder outcome categories, a simple biopsy prior to cART could elucidate a better combinatorial treatment approach.",Pathogenesis of the

"Automatic Volumetric Treatment Response Assessment and Determination of Regional Genetic Characteristics in Glioblastoma Project Summary Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary adult brain tumor with an incidence rate of 3.2 per 100,000 people. Due to its heterogeneous genetic characteristics, GBM carries a dismal prognosis, with a median survival of only 14 months and five-year survival rates are less than 10%. The current standard of care is maximal safe surgical resection, chemoradiation, and adjuvant temozolomide. Within the natural history of GBM, there are adaptive genetic changes within the tumor that lead to treatment resistance and inevitable recurrence, leading to patient death. While a variety of treatments can be administered for tumor recurrence, there is currently no consensus on therapy for recurrent tumor as none have been proven to provide substantial survival benefit. The major limitation of the current treatment strategy is that clinicians do not have a reliable method of longitudinally assessing tumor volumes and regional genetic characteristics of the tumor during the course of treatment. Rather, clinical decision-making is based on a manual and variable two- dimensional measure of tumor burden, a surrogate of tumor volume, and genetic characterization of select molecular markers at the time of initial surgery. A tool that can automatically assess tumor volumes and regional genetic characteristics longitudinally will substantially improve evaluation of treatment efficacy, allowing for an earlier switch to alternative treatment strategies and thus, more personalized tailoring of patient care. Thus, a critical need exists for automatic methods that non-invasively evaluate treatment efficacy on a patient-to-patient basis. To address this problem, we will develop a novel solution based on deep learning that leverages structural, diffusion, and perfusion information from multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging. At the core of our solution is a convolutional neural network; a machine learning technique that can be trained on raw image data to predict clinical outputs of interest. Firstly, we will develop a fully automatic technique for longitudinal tracking of tumor volumes. To do this, we will develop novel deep learning architectures through incorporation of state-of-the-art neural network components that can segment both whole tumor and tumor subregions (edema, non-enhancing tumor, and gadolinium contrast-enhancing tumor). To prove algorithm utility, we will automatically derive tumor volumes in a longitudinal patient cohort and correlate volumes with clinical outcomes. Secondly, we will develop a non-invasive, deep learning algorithm for evaluation of regional genetic characteristics of GBM. To train this algorithm, we will acquire imaging-localized surgical biopsies and genetic profiling of GBM patients undergoing surgery. Once trained, the algorithm can be used to non- invasively identify clonal populations and track genetic changes associated with clinical outcomes during the course of treatment. The development of these deep learning algorithms will transform physician’s capacity for clinical decision-making and dramatically improve outcomes for a devastating disease. Project Narrative The proposed research will provide automatic deep-learning tools to aid clinical decision-making for glioblastoma, the most common primary adult brain tumor that carries a dismal prognosis. The major limitation of the current treatment strategy is that clinicians do not have a reliable method of longitudinally assessing tumor volumes and regional genetic characteristics of the tumor during the course of treatment. A tool that can automatically assess tumor volumes and regional genetic characteristics longitudinally will substantially improve evaluation of treatment efficacy, allowing for an earlier switch to alternative treatment strategies and thus, more personalized tailoring of patient care and enhancement of clinical outcomes.",Automatic Volumetric Treatment Response Assessment and Determination of Regional Genetic Characteristics in Glioblastoma,9760521,F30CA239407,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Algorithms ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Biopsy ', ' Brain Neoplasms ', ' tumors in the brain ', ' Brain Tumors ', ' Brain Neoplasia ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diffusion ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Hydrops ', ' Dropsy ', ' Edema ', ' Gd element ', ' Gadolinium ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' spongioblastoma multiforme ', ' glioblastoma multiforme ', ' Grade IV Astrocytoma ', ' Grade IV Astrocytic Tumor ', ' Grade IV Astrocytic Neoplasm ', ' Glioblastoma ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Isocitrate Dehydrogenase ', ' Laboratories ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' Patients ', ' Perfusion ', ' Physicians ', ' Postoperative ', ' Post-Operative ', ' Postoperative Period ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' methazolastone ', ' Temodar ', ' Temodal ', ' temozolomide ', ' Measures ', ' Natural History ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Measurement ', ' Genetic Heterogeneity ', ' Oncologist ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Consensus ', ' Principal Component Analysis ', ' Principal Component Analyses ', ' chemoradiation ', ' radiochemotherapy ', ' radio-chemotherapy ', ' radio-chemo-therapy ', ' chemoradiotherapy ', ' chemo-radiotherapy ', ' chemo-radio-therapy ', ' chemo-/radio-therapy ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Tumor Volume ', ' Recurrent tumor ', ' neoplasm recurrence ', ' Recurrent Neoplasm ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Agreement ', ' Excision ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' Primary Brain Neoplasms ', ' Primary Brain Tumors ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Perfusion Weighted MRI ', ' Perfusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Address ', ' Tumor Burden ', ' Tumor Load ', ' Data ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Tumor-Derived ', ' Characteristics ', ' Adjuvant ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' therapy resistant ', ' treatment resistance ', ' therapeutic resistance ', ' resistant to therapy ', ' resistance to therapy ', ' genetic profiling ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' two-dimensional ', ' 2-dimensional ', ' tumor ', ' neuro-oncology ', ' neurooncology ', ' alternative treatment ', ' standard of care ', ' treatment response ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' treatment strategy ', ' molecular marker ', ' molecular biomarker ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' Radiogenomics ', ' clinical predictors ', ' contrast enhanced ', ' improved outcome ', ' actionable mutation ', ' driver mutation ', ' actionable variants ', ' mutational status ', ' mutation status ', ' deep learning ', ' neural network ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' ConvNet ', ' neural network architecture ', ' neural net architecture ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' ']",NCI,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,F30,2019,44949,MA-07,0.18121876220128916
"Integrated Discovery Pipeline for Tumor Neoantigens Project Summary Cancer immunotherapy is now established as a major therapeutic modality. Significant progress with checkpoint inhibitor monoclonal antibodies demonstrates durable tumor regression in metastatic melanoma, lung cancer and other malignancies. One conspicuous limitation is the paucity of validated tumor antigens, which impedes clinical investigators in their pursuit of developing new cancer immunotherapies. Tumor encoded non-synonymous mutations may provide a new source of potential target antigens. T cells recognize tumor missense mutations as amino acid substituted peptides presented in the context of major histocompatibility molecules on the cancer cell surface, thus implicating missense mutations as a source of patient-specific neoantigens. We recently described the first-in-human study to use next generation sequencing technologies to identify and validate tumor missense mutations as neoantigens. Our study demonstrates that vaccination increases the breadth and diversity of neoantigen-specific T cells resulting in a broad repertoire of effector CD8+ T cells that uniquely discriminates mutated antigens from wild type peptides ensuring tumor specificity. This proposal aims to find a unique solution to the scarcity of tumor antigens by developing a neoantigen discovery pipeline that integrates genomic and proteomic technologies. In this proposal, a unique academic-industry partnership comprised of an established team of experts, in cancer genomics, cancer proteomics, human immunology, and clinical oncology, aim to solve the challenging problem of tumor neoantigen discovery. The long-term goal is to develop a robust pipeline using cutting-edge technologies merged with machine learning algorithms to supply tumor neoantigens for clinical investigation. The goal of this proposal will be addressed in the experiments of the following specific aims: 1) to identify the repertoire of melanoma expressed somatic mutations by next generation sequencing technologies; 2) to develop a novel proteomics platform to identify melanoma neoantigens presented by HLA class I molecules; 3) to validate neoantigen identification in a vaccination protocol. The proposed pipeline will deliver a transformative solution for tumor antigen identification, should be translatable to other “immune responsive“ malignancies and enable the nascent discipline of precision medicine to provide effective and safe immunotherapies for cancer patients. Project Narrative This project is relevant to public health as it aims to develop a neoantigen discovery pipeline to address the paucity of validated cancer antigens available for immunotherapy. The pipeline integrates two powerful and well-established technologies, genomics and proteomics. If successful, this pipeline will enable the delivery of precision immunotherapy in a clinically relevant timeframe for patients with melanoma as well as other malignancies.",Integrated Discovery

"Characterization of the functions of one-carbon metabolism across human cancers Project Summary/Abstract Cancerous cells reprogram their metabolism to accommodate their needs. A deep understanding of this metabolic reprograming can lead to novel and promising routes toward cancer treatment. Different human cancers differ with respect to aspects of their metabolic rewiring, however a profound knowledge in this field is lacking. The main goal of my thesis project is to characterize the ways in which one-carbon metabolism — a metabolic pathway highly altered in cancer— is utilized by different human cancers and elucidate its consequences on downstream processes such as epigenetics and biosynthesis. Using information in genomic profiles of individual tumors, I build computational models to infer metabolic landscapes, assess their implications in patient survival, and predict response to chemotherapy. By studying one-carbon metabolites in the human serum, I confirm the relevance of theses findings in human contexts and suggest potentials for dietary intervention approaches. In aim 1, I characterize the usage of serine through one-carbon metabolism across human cancers. I performed flux analysis using gene expression profiles of hundreds of human tumors, followed by experimental validation using metabolomics approaches. In aim 2, I identify the determinants of human serum methionine. Diet records, serum metabolomics, and clinical data from a cohort of human subjects were incorporated into computational models. The determinants of variability in serum methionine were then quantified, suggesting a mechanism for regulation of cellular epigenetics by the diet. In aim 3, I determine the sources of variation in DNA methylation across human cancers and the contribution of metabolism. I integrated molecular and clinical profiles of thousands of human tumors from the TCGA into machine-learning algorithms to identify their association with DNA methylation. A major contribution from one-carbon metabolism in regulating DNA methylation status in tumors was found. In aim 4, I predict response to anti-metabolic chemotherapies based on tumor genomics. I plan to translate my previous findings into clinical discoveries. To this end, I will demonstrate how tumor profiles can be used to model patient survival, predict response to chemotherapy, and move toward precision medicine. Narrative Alteration in cellular metabolism is one the hallmarks of cancer. This project aims to elucidate the consequences of these alterations in cancer and reveal how different human cancers differ with respect to their metabolism.

"Integration of Genomic and Clinical Data to Enhance Subtyping of Colon Cancer ABSTRACT Colon cancer (CC) is a clinically and molecularly heterogeneous disease. While the TCGA data has implicated numerous molecular aberrations in cancer etiology and mechanisms, a direct link between genomic events and patient outcomes is lacking. While the TNM (tumor, node, metastasis) staging system is widely utilized and provides prognostic information, CCs show considerable stage-independent variability in outcome indicating that more robust classifiers are needed for prognostic stratification. Prognostic information is critical to guide patient management and surveillance after cancer resection and can inform treatment selection. Using only gene expression data, we identified four consensus molecular subtypes (CMS) of CC with distinct prognoses. We hypothesize that inclusion of additional genomic features will enable more granular molecular subtyping by identifying additional molecular patterns. Toward this objective (Aim 1), we will utilize multi-omics data sets generated from two completed phase III adjuvant chemotherapy trials in CC (NCCTG N0147, NSAPB C-08). We will also develop a supervised prognostic model by integrating comprehensive molecular data with clinicopathological variables and outcome data (Aim 2). Our unique resource for supervised learning is the high-quality survival data from the clinical trial cohorts. We hypothesize that integration of genomic alterations within clinically relevant genes and gene expression levels with clinicopathological variables can improve the prediction of recurrence/survival compared to traditional TNM staging alone. We will include in a step-wise fashion in our training models selected genes and miRNA expression, somatic mutations, minor allele frequencies, somatic copy number alterations as well as CMS and clinical features, to optimize predictive performance. Given that immune and stromal infiltrating cells are well recognized as determinants of prognosis in CC, we propose to characterize tumor immune and stromal markers among distinct CC molecular subtypes and determine their contribution to prognosis (Aim 3). Specifically, we will characterize these transcriptomic markers computationally, and determine whether they can refine molecular subtypes and improve prognostic modeling. Our proposal represents the first comprehensive prediction of CC patient survival using features from both genomic and transcriptomic alterations that will be integrated with immune and stromal markers using state-of-the-art supervised learning approaches. The impact of this work is substantial in that it will identify determinants of recurrence at the molecular pathway level or in the tumor microenvironment, which will help prioritize targets for therapeutic intervention. Furthermore, the outcome of this grant is expected to have practice-changing implications that can further advance the field of precision oncology. PROJECT NARRATIVE The survival of colon cancer patients varies considerably within the same tumor stage indicating the need for better predictors of outcome. We will use tumor molecular profiling data from clinical trial cohorts to identify subgroups of patients that show differences in outcome and then develop a model that includes both molecular and clinical data to predict survival. This information is critical for determining patient treatment and follow-up approaches that may be practice-changing.",Integration of Genomic and Clinical Data to Enhance Subtyping of Colon

"Accelerating Cancer Genomics with Cloud-scale Bioconductor PROJECT SUMMARY  The Bioconductor project is rooted in recognition that efﬁcient, rigorous, and reproducible analysis of high- dimensional data can be achieved when statisticians, biologists, and computer scientists federate efforts in a transparent and carefully engineered way. The project Accelerating Cancer Genomics with Cloud-scale Bio- conductor devises new approaches to carrying out genome-scale analysis of cancer data using cloud computing environments. The proposal is based on strategies that have proven highly effective in ﬁfteen years of supporting collaborative and carefully engineered software for genome scale analysis in computational biology in the Biocon- ductor project, based on the highly portable and widely adopted R language and environment for data analysis. In Aim 1 we develop architecture and infrastructure for scalably harvesting cloud-based representations of large- scale cancer genome studies such as The Cancer Genome Atlas, creating formal high-performance workﬂows for processing and interpreting cancer genome analyses, and providing packaging and data distribution schemes for moving data to the cloud for scalable analysis there. In Aim 2 we create and support independent creation of intuitive and cancer-relevant interface components supporting reproducible interactive exploration and analysis using the facilities of Rstudio. In Aim 3 we update and generalize the Bioconductor MLInterfaces metapackage to support advanced machine learning using the cancer-oriented strategies and facilities devised in Aims 1 and 2. Our proposal will beneﬁt large numbers of cancer researchers who will be taking advantage of cloud resources, probably with R close to hand, by marrying strengths of cloud-centric strategies for data archiving and query resolution, to the strengths of Bioconductor development and analysis capabilities. We have letters of support from the leadership of the three NCI Cancer Cloud Pilot projects for this project. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Despite major advances in elucidating mechanisms of tumor initiation and proliferation, treatment strategies for many cancers are ineffective, and patient-to-patient variation in treatment response suggests that personal targeting of cancer based on tumor molecular proﬁles will be necessary. This proposal takes a design and architecture approach from a widely used project for analyzing general data arising in genome-scale biology, and adapts it to new NCI-supported cloud-based data archives and analysis environments.

"Multi-parametric 4-D Imaging Biomarkers for Neoadjuvant Treatment Response ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Imaging plays a critical role in evaluating tumor response to treatment; however the currently used methods remain significantly limited. For example, standards such as the RECIST are subjective and cannot be used to adequately characterize irregular lesions; tumor volume measures alone do not account for detailed structural changes; and features from selected tumor regions, such as ""hot-spot"" peak-enhancement, do not capture information from the entire tumor. As such, current approaches fall short of capturing the multi-faceted effects of treatment, including phenotypic tumor heterogeneity and its longitudinal change during treatment, which is increasingly recognized as an important predictive indicator. To date, few studies have explored using richer imaging descriptors, which could result in more powerful predictive markers. Moreover, fewer have attempted to combine multi-modal biomarkers, such as imaging with histopathologic and molecular markers, to develop enhanced predictive models for specific tumor sub-types and individual patients. We propose to develop advanced computational tools that will enable to i) extract novel multi-parametric imaging signatures and ii) accurately characterize their longitudinal patterns of change during neoadjuvant treatment via deformable image registration. Our approach is thus geared towards knowledge discovery, for determining which imaging parameters have the highest predictive value out of many possible ways to quantify information provided by imaging. In SA1 we will develop robust 4D deformable image registration methods, based on principles of mutual saliency, for estimating transformations that will enable us to robustly register serial imaging scans and obtain anatomically precise spatio-temporal parametric maps of longitudinal tissue effects induced by treatment. In SA2 we will analyze whole-tumor and normal tissue effects by performing multi- parametric feature extraction, including a rich set of morphologic, textural, kinetic and parenchymal tissue descriptors, which in conjunction to registration will allow us to comprehensively capture the dynamically evolving imaging phenotype during treatment. In SA3 we will test our method in a major breast imaging study, the I-SPY 1/ACRIN 6657 trial. We will apply machine learning tools to identify high-dimensional associations of imaging patterns, in conjunction to histopathologic tumor subtyping, that can best predict pathologic complete response (pCR) and 5-year disease free survival (DFS). In SA4 we will independently test our models with the I-SPY 2/ACRIN 6698 trial, where we will also evaluate the robustness of our features to a diverse range of treatments. Our methods hold the promise to shift the current paradigm in personalizing neoadjuvant treatment by 1) improving the current standards of imaging-based assessment and 2) introducing new imaging biomarkers that can be of higher value as early predictors of treatment response and survival. Our tools will be shared as open-source software via NIH/NCI tool registries and open-challenge activities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Pattern analysis and machine learning methods are powerful knowledge discovery tools that can be very effective in identifying complex multi-parametric patterns from a diverse set of imaging and non-imaging biomarkers that can best predict treatment response and outcome. Our method will leverage the richness of available data to point to new imaging biomarkers that are better early predictors of response, enabling personalized treatment decisions for women undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer.",Multi-parametric 4-D Imaging Biomarkers for Neoadjuvant Treatment Response,9665259,R01CA197000,"['Anatomy ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences

"RADIOMICS-BASED PROGNOSTIC MODEL OF CERVICAL CANCER HABITATS Abstract Despite significant advances in disease prevention and screening, locally-advanced cervical cancer (LACC) continues to be an important world-wide public health problem. Responses to currently available treatments are highly variable among patients with similar constellations of accepted prognostic features, implying that chemo-radio sensitivity, patterns of local tumor proliferation, and the propensity of metastatic spread are highly dependent on each patient's potentially unique cervix cancer habitat. Radiomic analysis of pre-, in-, and post- treatment medical images is an exciting new class of prognostic cancer biomarkers for characterizing tumor habit and has shown promise in more accurately separating favorable- from unfavorable- prognosis for patients for several tumor sites. No such radiomic-based prognostic model has been developed, for LACC that supports meaningful personalization of local and systemic treatment or biologically treatment adaptation based on response of radiomic biomarker profiles to the initial fractions of radiotherapy. To support future personalized chemo-radiation therapy, we propose to exploit a large, prospectively collected database of ~400 LACC patients consisting of archived PET, MRI, and CT images, standard biomarkers, and clinical outcomes to develop an innovative and accurate radiomics-based prognostic model for predicting LACC treatment outcomes. Previous efforts to utilize high-dimensional radiomic feature spaces to predict cancer treatment outcomes have been compromised by small patient numbers relative to the feature space dimensionality; radiomic feature redundancy, feature heterogeneity and uncertainty; unbalanced outcome class patient cohorts; and intrinsic differences in prognostic information content for features extracted from different modality images. We propose a principled and systematic strategy to address these challenges: a novel combination of belief function theory (BFT) and more standard machine learning techniques. To achieve these goals, we propose the following specific aims. Aim 1: Develop a novel radiomics-based prognostic model for predicting outcomes of cervical cancer patients treated with definitive chemo-radiotherapy given longitudinal radiomic features from pre-, in-, and post treatment PET, CT, and MR images. Aim 2: Refine the developed prognostic model by use of the full 400 patient cases and systematically validate and test its performance. Aim 3: Investigate the potential clinical impact of the radiomic-based prognostic model and selected clinical applications. Clinical Impact and future plans: This project will result in a clinically useful family of models for predicting disease control outcomes from current LACC treatments. This clinical decision-making tool can be used to personalize initial treatment prescriptions as well as adaptive treatment prescription when combined with in-treatment radiomic biomarkers. We anticipate that many of the proposed methodological improvements investigated by this proposal will improve tumor response assessment in other disease sites.

"Rad-path-omic tools for rectal cancer treatment evaluation PROJECT SUMMARY: Of the estimated 43,030 patients who will be newly diagnosed with rectal cancer in 2018, a majority will receive neoadjuvant chemoradiation (NAC) to reduce tumor burden. All patients ultimately undergo an aggressive excision of the rectum, of which 25% exhibit complete pathologic response (pCR, i.e. disease- free after NAC) on the post-surgical specimen. These patients have therefore been subjected to an unnecessary, morbid procedure resulting in quality of life issues, in the absence of any definitive, non-invasive biomarkers for NAC response in vivo. While multi-parametric MRI is utilized to pre-operatively assess tumor response and regression to NAC, expert interpretation is confounded and variable due to overlapping appearance of benign treatment effects (e.g. fibrosis, ulceration) and residual tumor.  Recently, more quantitative characterization of lesions has been enabled via radiomics, involving high- throughput, computerized extraction of textural or kinetic attributes from imaging. Radiomic maps of the tumor environment can depict presence of different tissue types based on their structural and functional characteristics, visualized as regions of “low” and ‘high” feature expression. In fact, the post-NAC tumor environment on the excised rectal tissue specimen has been shown to reflect a variety and organization in different pathologic tissue types, also linked to patient prognosis and outcome. However, existing radiomic approaches only attempt to characterize the overall heterogeneity in a tissue region, as they lack “ground truth” to quantify tissue types and their organization on post-NAC MRI. A more comprehensive and accurate predictor for pCR based off multi- parametric MRI could thus be constructed by (a) quantifying the density and arrangement of structural and functional attributes on post-NAC rectal MRIs, and (b) optimizing radiomic descriptors against pathologically validated information of post-NAC tissue types on MRI, via spatial correlation with pathology.  In this proposal, I will develop novel radiomic tools in conjunction with spatially co-localized “ground truth” pathology to build a predictor for identifying rectal cancer patients exhibiting pCR via post-NAC MRI. Aim 1 will involve developing and evaluating a novel radiomic descriptor to quantify spatial organization of morphologic (via structural MRI) and physiologic (via contrast enhancement functional MRI) heterogeneity of the post-NAC lesion environment. Aim 2 will focus on optimizing this radiomic organization descriptor to capture distinctive tissue organization associated with pCR, via spatial mapping of post-surgical pathology information onto pre-operative MRI. My novel descriptor will be evaluated and validated via a machine learning predictor to identify patients exhibiting pCR using a discovery and a hold-out validation cohort, acquired from 2 different institutions; and compared with clinical markers of response. My project will build on promising preliminary results for my radiomic organization descriptor as well as a radiology-pathology co-registration framework, to result in a clinically reliable and impactful radiomics-based tool which could enable personalized management of rectal cancer patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE: This F31 proposal focuses on novel computational imaging tools for accurate identification and assessment of pathologic complete response to neoadjuvant chemoradiation via routine multi- parametric MRI. A comprehensive, quantitative assessment of post-chemoradiation tissue types and their tissue organization on imaging could enable (a) non-invasive identification of complete responders to avoid unneeded and highly morbid surgeries, and (b) more personalized management and follow-up for non-responders to NAC.",Rad-path-omic tools for rectal cancer treatment evaluation,9683190,F31CA216935,"['Rectal Cancer ', ' Rectum Carcinoma ', ' Rectum Cancer ', ' Rectal Carcinoma ', ' Clinical Markers ', ' Clinical Protocols ', ' colon and rectum surgery ', ' Colon and Rectal Surgery ', ' Colorectal Surgery ', ' Colostomy ', ' Colostomy Procedure ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Epidemiologic Confounding Factor ', ' Confounding Variables ', ' Confounding Factors (Epidemiology) ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Spillage ', ' Leakage ', ' Extravasation ', ' Fibrosis ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Kinetics ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Maps ', ' Mentors ', ' Methodology ', ' Tumor Staging ', ' Neoplasm Staging ', ' Cancer Staging ', ' Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging ', ' Paper ', ' Pathology ', ' Surgical Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Peer Review ', ' Perfusion ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Publishing ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Radiology ', ' General Radiology ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' Rectum ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' tumor specific biomarker ', ' tumor biomarker ', ' TM-MKR ', ' Tumor Markers ', ' Ulceration ', ' Ulcer ', ' X-Ray Medical Imaging ', ' X-Ray Imaging ', ' Roentgenography ', ' Radiography ', ' Diagnostic X-Ray Radiology ', ' Diagnostic X-Ray ', ' Diagnostic Radiology ', ' Conventional X-Ray ', ' Diagnostic radiologic examination ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' base ', ' density ', ' Procedures ', ' rectal ', ' Site ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Lesion ', ' uptake ', ' radiologist ', ' Functional disorder ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' oncology ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' Descriptor ', ' Morphology ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Specimen ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' chemoradiation ', ' radiochemotherapy ', ' radio-chemotherapy ', ' radio-chemo-therapy ', ' chemoradiotherapy ', ' chemo-radiotherapy ', ' chemo-radio-therapy ', ' chemo-/radio-therapy ', ' Texture ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Residual Tumors ', ' residual disease ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' Neoadjuvant Therapy ', ' Neoadjuvant Treatment ', ' Neoadjuvant ', ' NEOADJ ', ' Induction Therapy ', ' In complete remission ', ' complete response ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Appearance ', ' Excision ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Institution ', ' Sphincter ', ' Tumor Burden ', ' Tumor Load ', ' Data ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Imaging Device ', ' Imaging Tool ', ' Imaging Instrument ', ' in vivo ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' computer analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computational analyses ', ' Newly Diagnosed ', ' Validation ', ' Pathologic ', ' Characteristics ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' computerized ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' treatment effect ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' tumor ', ' treatment response ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' quantitative imaging ', ' contrast enhanced ', ' imaging biomarker ', ' imaging-based marker ', ' imaging-based biomarker ', ' imaging-based biological marker ', ' imaging marker ', ' response biomarker ', ' response markers ', ' personalized management ', ' precision management ', ' personalized disease management ', ' personalized clinical management ', ' individualized patient management ', ' individualized management ', ' radiomics ', ' patient response ', ' responsive patient ', ' digital pathology ', ' deep learning ', ' ']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,F31,2019,45016,OH-11,0.05393556275685546
"Harnessing protease activity for predictive monitoring of cancer immunotherapy Project Summary/Abstract The blockade of inhibitory immune checkpoints has transformed the treatment of cancer for patients across a broad range of malignancies. Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) is achieved by administering antibodies that block the cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) or the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) pathway to reinvigorate antitumor T cell activity. Despite treatment responses that are unprecedented and durable, the majority of patients do not experience a clinical benefit from treatment, and some responders relapse and acquire resistance. Moreover, response patterns of tumors treated with ICB are unconventional, and can be misinterpreted as disease progression by radiographic imaging. To maximize the precision and benefit of ICB therapy, identification of predictive and pharmacodynamic biomarkers to objectively assess immune responses has rapidly emerged as a clinical priority. The proposal aims to leverage protease activity as predictive biomarkers for monitoring ICB response and resistance. Proteases play a central role in the underlying biology of immunity, oncology, and anti-tumor responses. The mark of a “hot” tumor is signified by an effective immune infiltrate of cytotoxic T cells that lyse cancer cells via the classical perforin- and granzyme-mediated pathway – the latter of which comprise a family of potent serine proteases. Tumor expression of proteases, including inflammatory and matrix degrading proteases, is well-established as a hallmark of fundamental tumor processes including angiogenesis, growth, and metastasis. The central hypothesis is that quantifying the activity of T cell and tumor proteases early-on-treatment will allow identification of activity biomarkers that predict treatment efficacy and indicate resistance to ICB therapy. To achieve these goals, this proposal aims to develop a new class of checkpoint blockade antibodies that are endowed with the dual capacity to inhibit immune checkpoints and sense protease activity during treatment responses. These activity sensing ICB diagnostics, or IDB-Dx, comprise -PD-1 or -CTLA-4 antibodies that are site-specifically functionalized with a library of mass-barcoded peptide substrates. During responses to ICB, these peptides are cleaved by T cell and tumor proteases that are elevated in “hot” tumors, liberating a unique fingerprint of mass barcodes that are then filtered into the recipient’s urine for quantification by mass spectrometry. By applying machine learning algorithms, these signatures of protease activity are trained and validated as predictive classifiers to discriminate “hot” and “cold” tumors, responders from non-responders, and resistance to therapy. Project Narrative Cancer immunotherapy using immune checkpoint blockade is transforming the treatment of cancer patients. Although some patients experience durable responses, new methods are required to identify patient responders, evaluate unconventional immune responses, and detect immune resistance. We propose to develop a new class of checkpoint blockade therapies that harness protease activity for predictive monitoring of treatment response and resistance.",Harnessing protease activity for

"Quantitative Image Modeling for Brain Tumor Analysis and Tracking Project Summary Differentiation of tumor recurrence from radiation-induced necrosis (RN) is a critical step in the follow-up management of patients treated with stereotactic radiosurgery for brain tumor. A non-invasive method that is robust in discriminating RN from recurrent tumor using non-invasive method such as MRI is of a significant value for patients and physicians. The hypothesis of this proposed project is that advanced Machine-learning (ML) and image analysis of different MRI imaging information may hold potential for accurately detecting the difference between RN and recurrence of brain tumor is a substantial challenge in the daily practice in Neuro-Oncology.

"Radiogenomics framework for non-invasive personalized medicine Project summary Radiogenomics, is a burgeoning area of research that aims to link medical imaging with multi-omics molecular profiles of the same patients. Radiogenoimcs has shown its potential through its ability to predict clinical outcomes e.g. prognosis, and through predicting actionable molecular properties of tumors, e.g. the activity of EGFR, a major drug target in many cancers. The typical imaging genomics workflow consists of the following steps: (1) Identify the tumor through segmentation. This is often also defined as identifying Regions Of Interests or ROIs through a manual process with a radiologist or using computer vision algorithms. (2) Feature extraction, often also known as radiomics, whereby 100s of features are identified that capture the shape, the texture and the intensity distributions of lesions in 2D or 3D. (3) Supervised machine learning to predict clinical outcomes such as prognosis, overall survival or response to treatment, or predicting molecular profiles such as gene expression patterns or metagenes, or individual molecular properties such as the mutation status of a gene (e.g. EGFR). This workflow has been demonstrated in several cancers including lung cancer, brain tumors, hepatocellular carcinoma, breast cancer etc. Current radiogenomics applications are limited to study associations between imaging and molecular data, and predicting long term outcomes. However, no actionable information is gained from radiogenomics maps. In this renewal, we propose to develop a radiogenomics framework to support treatment response, treatment allocation and treatment monitoring: (1) we will develop informatics algorithms that integrate radiogenomic data for treatment response, (2) algorithms that allow combining radiogenomic data during treatment follow-up, and (3) algorithms that use the radiogenomic map to suggest novel drugs and predict drug target activities. Combining these complementary data sources in a radiogenomics framework for data fusion can have profound contributions toward predicting treatment outcomes by uncovering unknown synergies and relationships. More specifically, developing computational models integrating quantitative image features and molecular data to develop radiogenomics signatures, holds the potential to translate in benefit to tumor patients by investigating biomarkers that accurately predict therapy response of tumors. Readily, because medical imaging is part of the routine diagnostic work-up of cancer patients and molecular data of human tumors is increasingly being used in clinical workflows, therefore if reliable radiogenomic signatures can be found reflecting treatment response, translation to the clinical applications is feasible.

"Bayesian learning algorithms for identifying and classifying heterogeneity of cell types in variety of solid tumors Abstract Solid tumors are comprise the large majority of cancers (>90%). Standard of diagnosis and care often involved serial MR imaging for monitoring tumor response. It is not well understood how heterogeneity at the cellular and molecular levels affects the macroscopic imaging characteristics of these tumors. The long-term goal of this project is to provide computation tools for understanding the histopathologic variation of solid tumors and aid the development of image guided therapies for individualizing solid tumor treatment. The overall objective is to combine radiographic imaging with histopathological samples (i.e., radio-pathomics) to create and validate predictive tools for accurately defining tumor margins and spatial molecular profiles. Our central hypothesis is that microscopic cytological features and spatially dependent molecular profiles are reliably detectable and quantifiable with macroscopic MR imaging and that they can contribute towards the development of adaptive radiation therapy (ART). Two specific aims will objectively test this hypothesis by first determining which microscopic tissue features contribute to distinct measurements with MR imaging, and second, determining the development of fast and accurate computational tools for using MR image guided radiation therapy in clinical settings. Project Narrative The proposal aims to advance our current understanding of the association of malignant solid tumors at the cellular level. We plan to develop fast computational tools for real time image guided radiation, personalized to individual variations in cancer patients.

"Hybrid virtual-MRI/CBCT: A new paradigm for image guidance in liver SBRT ABSTRACT This proposal aims to establish a hybrid virtual-MRI/CBCT system for precision image guidance in radiation therapy of liver cancer. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) improves the treatment outcome over conventional fractionated radiotherapy by delivering high fractional dose in few fractions. However, SBRT of liver cancer still has high local failure rate up to 20-30% at 2-3 years and high overall grade>=3 toxicity rate up to 30% with patient deaths from the treatment. Previous studies demonstrated a strong correlation between the treatment outcome and the tumor localization accuracy of the image guidance technique used. Currently, cone beam CT (CBCT) is the most widely used imaging technique for liver SBRT. However, CBCT has extremely limited soft tissue contrast with no visualization of most liver tumors. As a result, its localization error is frequently over 6mm, and the dose coverage of tumor volume can fall below 90%, which is far from enough for tumor control. Drastically reducing localization errors is imperative to improve the outcome of liver SBRT. Combined MRI-Radiotherapy machines could provide MRI contrast for liver tumor localization. However, such machines are rare and expensive for most clinics. As such, an alternative solution is urgently required to meet the ubiquitous need of all radiation oncology departments: a solution in the form of a novel low-cost imaging system with MRI equivalent contrast. Since CBCT is readily available on most radiotherapy machines, creating CBCT-based imaging systems would be the most effective strategy. Our recent publication demonstrated the feasibility of such strategy. (Harris, Med Phys 2018) Our long-term goal is to establish the next generation of CBCT systems with virtual multi-modality imaging capabilities for high precision tumor localization and adaptive therapy in radiation therapy. In this application, our overall objective is to establish a novel system to generate hybrid virtual-MRI/CBCT from CBCT, with virtual-MRI inside the liver for target localization and augmented CBCT outside the liver for healthy tissue verification. The specific aims are: (1). Establish a 3D hybrid virtual- MRI/CBCT system for image guidance in breath-hold liver SBRT without respiratory motion. (2). Establish a 4D hybrid virtual-MRI/CBCT system for image guidance in free-breathing liver SBRT with respiratory motion. (3). Optimize and clinically evaluate the systems through simulation studies and a prospective clinical trial. Our expected deliverables through the academic-industrial partnership are novel hybrid virtual-MRI/CBCT systems ready to be integrated to all radiotherapy machines with only CBCT systems. This new imaging capability will have significant clinical impact because it will create a paradigm shift in image-guided radiation therapy by revolutionizing the widely used CBCT systems to enable a new era of low-cost high-precision virtual multi- modality guided radiotherapy. This precision guidance can lead to breakthrough in escalating the tumor control and minimizing the toxicities of liver SBRT as well as treatments of other sites with tumors in the soft tissue. Project Narrative The hybrid virtual-MRI/CBCT system will be a low-cost imaging system with superb soft tissue contrast to provide precise image guidance for liver SBRT, which paves the road to further margin reduction and dose escalation. As a result, this novel system has a great potential to enhance the tumor local control and reduce the normal tissue toxicities for all patients under liver SBRT treatments. Finally yet importantly, the hybrid virtual-MRI/CBCT system can also be potentially applicable for improving the image guidance precision of radiation therapy treatments of other clinical sites with tumors in the soft tissue, such as breast and prostate cancers.",Hybrid virtual-MRI/CBCT: A new paradigm for image guidance in liver SBRT,9801976,R01EB028324,"['Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Breathing ', ' inspiration ', ' Respiratory Inspiration ', ' Respiratory Aspiration ', ' Atlases ', ' Award ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Elements ', ' Goals ', ' Hybrids ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' hepatic body system ', ' Liver ', ' liver tumor ', ' hepatic tumor ', ' hepatic neoplasm ', ' hepatic neoplasia ', ' Hepatic Neoplasms ', ' Liver neoplasms ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Motion ', ' Patients ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Publishing ', ' treatment with radiation ', ' radio-therapy ', ' radiation treatment ', ' Radiotherapy ', ' Radiotherapeutics ', ' Radiation therapy ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' training transfer ', ' learning transfer ', ' Psychological Transfer ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' falls ', ' Imagery ', ' Visualization ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Surface ', ' Clinical ', ' Residual state ', ' Residual ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Ensure ', ' Financial compensation ', ' Compensation ', ' soft tissue ', ' Failure ', ' Hepatotoxicity ', ' hepatoxicity ', ' hepatic toxicity ', ' Toxic effect on liver cells ', ' Liver Toxicity ', ' Hepatotoxic effect ', ' Radiation Oncology ', ' oncology ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' Normal tissue morphology ', ' Normal Tissue ', ' Malignant neoplasm of liver ', ' malignant liver tumor ', ' liver cancer ', ' Hepatic Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Clinic ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' 3D ', ' 3-D ', ' Tumor Volume ', ' respiratory ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Toxicities ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Multimodal Imaging ', ' multimodality imaging ', ' multi-modality imaging ', ' multi-modal imaging ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cone-beam computed tomography ', ' volumetric computed tomography ', ' volume computed tomography ', ' volume CT ', ' cone-beam CT ', ' cost ', ' virtual ', ' next generation ', ' clinical research site ', ' clinical site ', ' prospective ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' tumor ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' industry partner ', ' industry partnership ', ' industrial partnership ', ' clinical practice ', ' image guided radiation therapy ', ' image-guided radiotherapy ', ' image guided radiation treatment ', ' IGRT ', ' image guided ', ' image guidance ', ' Fractionated radiotherapy ', ' imaging system ', ' improved outcome ', ' imaging capabilities ', ' recursive neural network ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' ConvNet ', ' random forest ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' ']",NIBIB,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,553348,NC-04,0.06766836828673355
"Proteogenomic Data Analysis for Cancer Systems Biology and Clinical Translation PROJECT SUMMARY It has become feasible to generate deep quantitative data for many of the molecules that are functional in cells, making it possible to survey a large number of tumors measuring genomic alterations and changes to transcripts, proteins and metabolites. It is, however, not clear what is the best way to integrate these data sets to extract as much information as possible about the biology that drives the cancer and how to best disrupt the tumor growth. Our proposed Proteogenomic Data Analysis Center for Cancer Systems Biology and Clinical Translation will develop new methods for better analyzing and integrating these data sets. In addition to developing statistical and machine learning methods, we also emphasize visual exploration of the data, and we will implement interactive web browser based visualization that will allow researchers to easily explore these vast data sets and gain novel insights by being able to quickly switch between summary information and details of the raw data. PROJECT NARRATIVE The mission of the proposed data analysis center is to leverage high dimensional large-scale data from tumor samples to identify new avenues for the development of clinical prognostics and therapeutics for cancer. This mission will be realized through analysis, integration and visualization of multi-omic datasets including genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data collected from patient samples to develop

"(PQ2) PD-L1/PD-1 signals in aged hosts undergoing cancer immunotherapy This proposal combines a team with expertise in aging, tumor immunology, tumor immunotherapy, specific genetically modified animal models and early phase clinical trials with a computational team having great expertise in analyzing and modeling aging of the immune system. We will study age effects on PD-L1/PD-1 signaling in the host and the tumor focusing on melanoma with some bladder cancer work, two tumors that are highly responsive to αPD-1 and/or αPD-L1 as proofs-of-concept, and residing in distinct anatomic compartments. In Aim 1 we study tumor PD-L1 intrinsic effects on αPD-L1 and αPD-1 treatment in melanoma and bladder cancer using transplantable B16 and inducible Nras/Cdk2n melanoma models, and transplantable MB49 and BBN-induced tumors for bladder cancer studies. We also use novel melanoma and BC models with tumor cell- specific PD-L1KO. We study 3 cohorts of elderly versus younger humans getting αPD-L1 or αPD-1 for melanoma or bladder cancer for human validation. We measure high-dimensional cell phenotypes and signaling responses, proteins and genes to maximize the information collected from human samples and mice using 23-color FACS, CyTOF, Luminex, Nanostring and other approaches. In Aim 2 we use all the above models and analytic strategies in young and aged PD-L1KO mice and WT or bone marrow chimeras to test hematopoietic and non- hematopoietic (host) PD-L1 signals in treatment outcomes in melanoma and bladder cancer. In Aim 3 the Systems Immunology team will use their innovative and successful computational modeling to identify age- related co-predictors of immunotherapy response and to identify candidate mechanisms for responders and non- responders. We will define a trajectory of immune system aging in mice at ultra-high resolution by performing a systems level integrative analysis of aging in Collaborative Cross and BL6 mice tracked in a combined longitudinal and cross-sectional study. This trajectory will be used to understand how tumor response and treatment outcomes vary as a function of age, and to build a simple, low parameter (i.e., easily testable and clinically translated), predictive models of treatment response. We will test insights by analyzing immune data from aged versus young patients undergoing αPD-L1 and αPD-1 cancer immunotherapy in novel machine learning approaches that we pioneered to identify insights from mouse data that are relevant to humans. Coupling this disease information with the healthy human aging trajectory that we recently defined will allow us to adapt our mouse data to predict optimal treatments in humans based on chronological and immune aging. This combined trans-disciplinary approach will identify common age-related disabilities that reduce PD-L1/PD-1 based immunotherapy responses and suggest tailored treatments for optimal efficacy that could later be tested in validation sets. These data can also be applied to other types of immunotherapy as we will also test. Cancer is a disease of the aged, but therapies are generally modeled in the young. We study age effects on cancer immunotherapy in response to PQ2 to develop ways to optimize cancer immunotherapy in aged patients most at risk. We focus on the PD-L1/PD-1 axis that is the cornerstone of the most successful cancer immunotherapies to date.",(PQ2) PD-L1/PD-1 signals in aged hosts undergoing cancer

"Bronchoscope-guided microwave ablation of early-stage lung tumors PROJECT SUMMARY In this Industry-Academic partnership R01 research plan, we propose the development, optimization, and pilot first-in-human evaluation of a bronchoscope-guided microwave ablation (MWA) system for rapid and conformal thermal ablation of early stage pulmonary tumors. Minimally-invasive, image- guided MWA is a cost-effective treatment for thermal destruction of unresectable tumors in the liver, lung, kidney, and other organs. Current MWA technology for pulmonary tumors is limited to a percutaneous approach, which precludes treatment of central tumors and has a high associated risk of pneumothorax. Furthermore, limited intra-procedural feedback and lack of guidance and treatment planning tools places a substantial burden on the physician to precisely position applicators and ensure adequate ablation of the target, while limiting damage to non-targets. Virtual bronchoscopy and navigation, pioneered by Broncus Medical (industrial partner), affords accurate, minimally-invasive access to early-stage pulmonary tumors, with minimal risk of pneumothorax, compared to a percutaneous approach. The team at Kansas State University (academic partner) will develop optimized flexible microwave applicators for delivering localized thermal ablation to pulmonary tumors via a bronchoscopic approach. The proposed MWA devices include antennas with directional control of microwave power deposition for precise ablation of small targets, and will be extensively evaluated with computational models and experimentally, on the benchtop, and in an in vivo animal model. Transient changes in antenna impedance matching will be exploited as a feedback parameter for assessing ablation progress. A machine-learning based treatment planning and guidance platform will be developed and integrated with Broncus’ Archimedes planning and virtual bronchoscopy platform to guide the selection of optimal treatment parameters. The integrated system will be translated for first-in- human studies to evaluate the feasibility and safety of bronchoscopically delivering MWA for targeting pulmonary tumors (subaward with University of British Columbia, through Broncus Medical). The central hypothesis of this research is that a bronchoscopic MWA system integrating: (1) applicators with directional control of ablation profiles; (2) impedance-based intra-procedural feedback; and (3) bronchoscopic guidance and treatment planning tools, will afford the safe and effective treatment of localized early-stage pulmonary tumors. The proposed research will lead to the development of an integrated system for bronchoscopic ablation of pulmonary tumors, and its pilot feasibility assessment in human patients. If successful, this work will considerably expand the range of patients with lung tumors that can be treated with a cost-effective, minimally-invasive approach. PROJECT NARRATIVE Microwave ablation (MWA) is a minimally invasive treatment option for thermal destruction of tumors, that is in clinical use for treating tumors in the lung with a percutaneous approach. If successful, this research will lead to the development and first-in-human evaluation of MWA devices that can be delivered through a bronchoscope, and integrated with an image-guidance and treatment planning platform.",Bronchoscope-guided microwave ablation of early-stage lung tumors,9624746,R01CA218357,"['Animals ', ' British Columbia ', ' Bronchoscopy ', ' Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma ', ' nonsmall cell lung cancer ', ' Nonsmall Cell Lung Carcinoma ', ' Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ', ' NSCLC - Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ', ' NSCLC ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Environment ', ' Feedback ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Heating ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Industrialization ', ' Industry ', ' Kansas ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' hepatic body system ', ' Liver ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Lung ', ' lung disorder ', ' disorder of the lung ', ' disease of the lung ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Lung diseases ', ' Pulmonary Neoplasms ', ' Lung Tumor ', ' Lung Neoplasms ', ' microwave radiation ', ' Microwaves ', ' Microwave Electromagnetic ', ' microwave electromagnetic radiation ', ' Nodule ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pneumothorax disorder ', ' Pneumothorax ', ' emphysematous ', ' Emphysema ', ' Pulmonary Emphysema ', ' Radiation-Non-Ionizing Total ', ' Nonionizing Electromagnetic Radiation ', ' Non-Ionizing Radiation ', ' Non-Ionizing Electromagnetic Radiation ', ' Nonionizing Radiation ', ' treatment with radiation ', ' radio-therapy ', ' radiation treatment ', ' Radiotherapy ', ' Radiotherapeutics ', ' Radiation therapy ', ' Research ', ' Research Support ', ' respiratory function ', ' lung function ', ' Respiratory physiology ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' electric impedance ', ' Impedance ', ' Electrical Impedance ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' Bronchoscopes ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Interstitial Lung Diseases ', ' Incineration ', ' Thermal Destruction ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Deposition ', ' Deposit ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Ablation ', ' experience ', ' animal data ', ' lung preservation ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' treatment planning ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Toxicities ', ' Thermal Ablation Therapy ', ' thermal tumor ablation ', ' thermal ablation ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Modality ', ' Devices ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' in vivo ', ' Translational Research ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Unresectable ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' cost ', ' virtual ', ' computerized ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' tumor ', ' minimally invasive ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' minimal risk ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' microwave ablation ', ' image guided ', ' image guidance ', ' tumor ablation ', ' safety and feasibility ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' first-in-human ', ' first in man ', ' optimal treatments ', ' optimal therapies ', ' real time monitoring ', ' realtime monitoring ', ' ']",NCI,KANSAS STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,295727,KS-01,0.11640456408802437
"Advanced preoperative assessment of meningiomas PROJECT SUMMARY Meningiomas, which arise from arachnoid cells, make up >1/3 of all intracranial tumors. While typically benign, these tumors induce clinical symptoms due to mass effect and peritumoral edema. In cases requiring intervention, gross total resection provides the best outcomes when possible. However, treatment strategy is ultimately decided by determining the proper balance between surgical difficulty and the patient's overall health. Two mechanical properties are important predictors of surgical difficulty: tumor stiffness and adherence to surrounding tissues. Knowledge of these properties before surgery would allow clinicians to more accurately assess surgical risk and identify the most effective treatment strategy. Mechanical properties are difficult to predict by conventional imaging approaches, but can be directly assessed by Magnetic Resonance Elastography (MRE) and related Slip Interface Imaging (SII). In published studies, we have shown that MRE-based stiffness estimates are significantly correlated with tumor stiffness in meningiomas and pituitary adenomas. Furthermore, SII accurately predicted tumor adherence in meningiomas and vestibular schwannomas. Still, challenges remain to make these findings clinically-impactful. For estimating stiffness, the primary limitation lies in resolution. Therefore, in Aim 1 we will develop a voxel- wise classifier of tumor stiffness. This aim will build on our recently published neural network-based inversion (NNI), which has demonstrated superior performance to conventional direct inversions in simulation and in the brain. In Aim 1a, we will advance NNI by implementing more complex neural network architectures and creating more realistic simulations for training. In Aim 1b, the advances will be validated in a phantom with inhomogeneous stiffness. Finally, in Aim 1c with the aid of our Neurosurgery collaborators, we will collect a large sample of surgical stiffness assessments. We will use these assessments to train a voxel-wise stiffness classifier, which will then be validated in a separate test set. This aim will result in a map that conveys both stiffness and confidence in the prediction on a scale that is clinically meaningful to surgeons. The most-pressing limitations in SII include the subjective interpretation of the images and the lack of spatially resolved predictions. Aim 2 will address these challenges by developing a voxel-wise slip interface classifier. In Aim 2a, we will investigate a neural network-based predictor of slip interfaces to add to our current methods. In Aim 2b, we will evaluate if this new method can improve predictions in phantom experiments. In Aim 2c, we will again leverage surgical assessments of meningioma adherence to train and test a voxel-wise classifier. The result of this aim will be a map of tumor adherence represented as an easily interpreted probability. Taken together, these aims will provide neurosurgeons with clinically-important information to improve patient management. More broadly, technical advances made in this project will impact the entire MRE field. PROJECT NARRATIVE Meningiomas are the most common type of intracranial tumor and are best treated by total resection when possible. The mechanical properties of these tumors are important factors in surgical difficulty, where soft, non- adherent tumors are more easily removed that firm or adherent tumors. This project will use Magnetic Resonance Elastography and related Slip Interface Imaging to directly measure these properties, providing new clinically-important information to neurosurgeons and patients.",Advanced preoperative assessment of meningiomas,9755633,R01EB027064,"['Algorithms ', ' Arachnoid mater ', ' Arachnoid ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Counseling ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Hydrops ', ' Dropsy ', ' Edema ', ' Environment ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Incidence ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Maps ', ' meningioma ', ' Methods ', ' vestibular Schwannoma ', ' Vestibular Neurilemmoma ', ' Acoustic Schwannoma ', ' Acoustic Neurinoma ', ' Acoustic Neurilemoma ', ' Acoustic Neurilemmoma ', ' Acoustic Neuroma ', ' neurosurgery ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Pituitary Adenoma ', ' Pituitary Gland Adenoma ', ' Probability ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' human subject ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' Neurosurgeon ', ' neuro-surgeon ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Skull Base Neoplasms ', ' skull base tumor ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' Location ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' magnetic field ', ' Surgeon ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' heuristics ', ' simulation ', ' Excision ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' imaging method ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Resolution ', ' Magnetic Resonance Elastography ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Intracranial Neoplasms ', ' Intracranial Tumor ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Tumors ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Neoplasms ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' Outcome ', ' Network-based ', ' tumor ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' treatment strategy ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' clinical practice ', ' treatment choice ', ' mechanical properties ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' imaging approach ', ' imaging based approach ', ' artificial neural network ', ' synthetic neural network ', ' computational neural network ', ' artificial neural net ', ' neural network ', ' neural network architecture ', ' neural net architecture ', ' surgical risk ', ' surgery risk ', ' ']",NIBIB,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2019,357750,MN-01,0.12556907389631064
"Towards the automation of MR spectroscopic imaging in patients with glioblashoma Glioblastoma is the most common adult primary brain tumor and is highly aggressive in its disease course. Despite advances in neurosurgical resection, radiation targeting, and chemotherapy, the prognosis remains grim with a median survival of just 15 months. The effectiveness of current radiation therapy strategies is severely limited by shortcomings in the imaging modalities used to develop treatment plans. Current radiation therapy planning is mainly based on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI, which identifies high grade tumors that are immediately associated with leaky neovasculature. Although it is an excellent diagnostic tool to identify high grade from low grade tumors, it is unable to signal occult infiltration beyond the core of the tumor. Though many believe GBM to be an incurable disease, we believe we have identified a method for optimizing tumor targeting that will increase the effectiveness of radiation therapy. A significant component of the current problem in GBM therapy is the lack of treatment for non-enhancing regions that are significantly infiltrated by neoplastic glioma cells without neovascularization. This untreated population undoubtedly leads to early recurrence. The proposed study addresses an important step toward translating an advanced quantitative imaging modality that complements the conventional imaging that is capable of reliably revealing glioma- infiltrated regions for precise, personalized treatment targeting. Proton spectroscopic magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) is an alternative modality able to identify endogenous metabolism within tissue without the need for exogenous contrast, and has been shown to identify the metabolic abnormalities associated with tumor beyond the regions identified by T1-weighted MRI. The clinical integration of sMRI in patient management has been limited due to the computational challenges of analysis of sMRI data. Two key hurdles to be overcome are the insufficiency of filters to remove image artifacts and the necessity of quantification of metabolic levels relative to a patient's baseline metabolism. As a result, sMRI processing requires skilled user intervention and many hours of computational and user time. To automate this pipeline and provide clinically useful information to oncologists, we seek to develop a software framework for the automated and expedient processing of sMRI for use in radiation therapy planning. We will use novel advances in the fields of high performance computing and deep learning, an approach to computation that has shattered benchmarks in many medical and non-medical problems. Specifically, we will develop filters for removing artifacts, algorithms for personalized diagnosis of tumor infiltration, and explore deep learning as a method to synthesize sMRI data with anatomical and clinical metrics in a fully automated fashion. Success in the proposed work will produce a “scanner-to-clinician” platform for quantitative, expedient, and objective analysis methods to integrate sMRI into the clinical radiation therapy planning paradigm. Ultimately, we believe this additional modality in the physician's tool belt will lead to better outcomes in patients suffering from this debilitating disease. Project Narrative  Proton spectroscopic magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) is a molecular imaging modality that can accurately detect abnormalities in the metabolic signatures of tumor cells, making it ideal for the detection and monitoring of highly infiltrative brain tumors like glioblastoma. Clinical adoption of sMRI has been slow due to limited tools for expedient and objective processing of sMRI data into information that oncologists can use for therapy planning. This proposal addresses these challenges using recent advances in high performance computing and machine learning to develop a software framework for using sMRI in the clinical management of patients with glioblastoma.",Towards the automation of MR spectroscopic imaging in patients with glioblashoma,9638528,F30CA206291,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', '

"Quantitative Multimodal Image Guidance for Improved Liver Cancer Treatment Project Summary/Abstract  Liver cancer is the second most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide and is likely to grow even more in the next decade given the epidemic levels of hepatitis B and C and the emergence of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) due to obesity in the US. Most liver cancer patients present with disease that cannot be treated surgically. Minimally invasive, catheter-based, intra-arterial therapies such as TACE (transarterial chemoembolization) have become the mainstay therapy and are included in all treatment guidelines because of their ability to achieve local tumor control and extend survival. TACE overcomes the problem of chemoresistance in cancer cells by delivering high dose chemotherapy through image guidance and embolization of the tumor feeding blood vessel. TACE most commonly uses an oily medium (Lipiodol) as a radiopaque drug delivery mate- rial by creating an emulsion between drugs and oil. The recent introduction of drug-eluting bead (DEB) technol- ogy provides an opportunity to achieve the goal of controlled and sustainable drug release to tumors, which was not possible with oily TACE. Although TACE clearly improves patient survival, limitations still exist – speciﬁcally, incomplete treatment and tumor recurrence – attributed to the stimulation of angiogenesis. Most of these issues can be addressed with a greater understanding of the tumor microenvironment, in particular the relationship that exists between hypoxia, acidosis and angiogenesis. In fact, the development of imaging biomarkers reﬂecting changes within the tumor microenvironment is increasingly being pursued to individualize cancer therapies and increase their potency. Yet, our ability to characterize the tumor microenvironment using current imaging tech- nology is extremely limited. TACE has had to rely on 2D X-ray angiography until recently when the emergence of intra-procedural dual phase cone beam CT (DP-CBCT) contributed signiﬁcantly to improving tumor visualization, microcatheter guidance, and treatment endpoint. It is precisely through the longstanding close partnership be- tween Philips, Johns Hopkins and now Yale that this technology was optimized and became broadly accepted as the new standard of practice for TACE, demonstrating the prompt successful translation of research ﬁndings to clinical practice. However, the targeting of tumors and assessment of outcomes continues to be limited, relying on qualitative/semi-quantitative enhancement patterns from DP-CBCT and single parameter MR images. The unique partnership between Yale & Philips provides innovative technology that will directly enhance the role of image-guided intervention and address this unmet need by quantitatively characterizing the tumor microenvi- ronment and tumor tissue composition in order to maximize treatment potency and improve outcomes. We will integrate advanced, multiparameter MR with active CBCT imaging and create valuable biomarkers derived from novel machine learning methods for image and data analysis. By providing essential, quantitative information, drug delivery to tumors can be maximized because it will be based on inherent tumor properties. In the same way, the assessment of therapy will be much more precise and therefore useful to identify responders. Project Narrative This grant is aimed at enhancing our ability to deliver minimally invasive catheter-based treatments for liver cancer using drug delivery platforms which simultaneously embolize the tumor vasculature and locally deliver chemotherapy agents, and assess their efﬁcacy. At the core of the effort is the development, evaluation and translation to clinical practice of advanced imaging and analysis methods to characterize the tumor microen- vironment and derive feature information from novel multiparameter, multimodal images to classify tissue and quantify the response to therapy. The resulting methodology will lead to improved patient care through more precise delivery and more accurate response assessment.",Quantitative Multimodal Image Guidance for Improved Liver Cancer

"UCSC-Buck Specialized Genomic Data Analysis Center for the Genomic Data Analysis Network The “UCSC-Buck Genome Data Analysis Center for the Genomic Data Analysis Network” will develop state-of-the-art methods for integrating various types of data to discover the genetic pathways, the microenvironment, the originating cells, and the oncogenic processes driving the initiation and progression of tumors. The long term goals of the project are to identify highly accurate models detailing the faulty genetic circuitry at work in each subclone of a patient’s tumor, as well as any “normal” cells acting as accomplices by supporting the cancer microenvironment. The ultimate objective is to encode computer algorithms that can search a patient’s individual pathway diagram for the best combination of interventions to eliminate every tumor cell, while preserving the health of every normal cell, in their body. Integrative pathway analysis methods will be developed to reveal signatures of tumor subtypes from Pan-Cancer and external datasets. New technologies will be established for uncovering network models tailored to individual patients. The tools will be deployed as part of an active collaboration to support the specific projects of the Genome Data Analysis Network. Novel probabilistic graphical models will be used to infer disrupted signaling. Cellular signatures will be collected from the analysis of normal cells, cancer cell line models, and Pan-Cancer investigations. Novel machine-learning methods, guided by pathway mechanisms, will be established to identify cell state signatures in heterogeneous patient samples. This work will reveal rare mutations driving metastatic transformation that are currently of unknown significance. New clues about the genetic circuitry promoting response and resistance to treatment will be established. Finally, cross-tumor connections that relate tumors of one type to a different type will suggest new avenues for treatment. Computational strategies for interpreting the results of cancer genome sequencing projects are in  desperate need. To select appropriate treatment strategies for a patient, an accurate model of the  altered genetic wiring in the tumor is needed as well as how that wiring relates to other tumors  and to other normal cells at various stages of differentiation.

"The Mechanism of SOX6 in Ewing Sarcoma Metastasis Project Summary Current survival rates of pediatric cancers like leukemia have seen drastic positive response in survival and treatment in the last 20 years. In stark contrast, patients with solid tumor metastasis challenge the current paradigm of intense chemotherapy treatment. Such treatments have failed to change the poor prognosis of metastatic disease indicating a need to understand the complex underpinnings of the in vivo metastatic microenvironment. This need for understanding is enhanced in pediatric patients, where metastasis is promoted by access to a large pool of undifferentiated cells. This project addresses this critical issue in Ewing sarcoma, a cancer that codifies the challenges and shortcomings of current cancer therapeutics. Ewing sarcoma is a malignant cancer of bone and soft tissue targeting children, adolescents and young adults. Overall survival rates for Ewing sarcoma patients with metastasis is abysmal at less than 20% for those with advanced disease and at 60% for those with localized tumors. One in three patients with Ewing sarcoma will have presentation of metastasis. These metrics demonstrate the desperate need to further understand the genesis of metastasis in vivo. This proposal focuses in on the role of the transcription factor SOX6 and its role in Ewing sarcoma metastasis. My preliminary zebrafish xenograft data show a clear, marked increase in metastasis with normal levels of SOX6, while SOX6 shRNA knockdown cells have less or no metastatic spread from injection site. My SOX6 knockdown proteome data show suppression of CAV1, a known gene targeting E-cadherin expression in Ewing sarcoma and increase of BCL2A1, an established anti-apoptotic protein involved in numerous cancer cells. This project’s central hypothesis is: 1) SOX6 mediated protein changes cause an increase in motility and decrease in apoptosis leading to metastasis and 2) that upon metastasis, interaction with the microenvironmental niche triggers invasive proliferative phenotypes mediated by downstream targets of SOX6. These SOX6-mdediated phenotype and proteomic changes support a story of in vivo initiation and persistence of metastatic lesions in Ewing sarcoma. This proposal is the first to look at the intersection of the cell microenvironment with SOX6 to show a new pathway for advancing momentum to targeted treatment of metastasis. Using my unique background in engineering and my training in cell biology, I propose a method that remediates key failures of current treatment by understanding the initiation of metastasis in vivo, persistence of cancer cells, and microenvironmental effects fostering metastasis. This proposal unites many disciplines to offer scientific impact on the genesis of metastasis and provides an incredible opportunity to train my skills as a future independent investigator. Project Narrative: Many metastatic models of cancer fail to account for the complexity of the tumor microenvironment at the metastatic niche, and the zebrafish provides a readily imageable model to analyze human cancer metastasis using machine learning. This project looks at the in vivo role of the transcription factor SOX6 in metastatic progression of Ewing sarcoma through cell proliferation, motility change, and apoptosis suppression. Further understanding and characterization of SOX6 will provide a new pathway for understanding metastatic progression, commonly associated with poor prognosis, in human Ewing sarcoma patients.",The Mechanism of SOX6 in Ewing Sarcoma Metastasis,9833891,F31CA236410,"['Behavior ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cellular Adhesion ', ' Cell Adhesion ', ' cell culture ', ' Cell Culture Techniques ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Motility ', ' Cellular Motility ', ' Cellular Migration ', ' Cell Movement ', ' Cell Migration ', ' Cell Locomotion ', ' cell motility ', ' Cell Viability ', ' Cell Survival ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Collagen ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Embryonic ', ' Embryo ', ' Engineering ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' In Vitro ', ' leukemia ', ' Methods ', ' Microscopy ', ' tumor cell metastasis ', ' cancer metastasis ', ' Secondary Tumor ', ' Secondary Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Tumor ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Mass ', ' Metastatic Lesion ', ' Metastasize ', ' Metastasis ', ' Neoplasm Metastasis ', ' optical ', ' Optics ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Metastatic to ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Testing ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' transcription factor ', ' Uvomorulin ', ' Epithelial-Cadherin ', ' Epithelial Calcium-Dependent Adhesion Protein ', ' Cadherin-1 ', ' E-Cadherin ', ' Work ', ' Zebra Fish ', ' Zebra Danio ', ' Danio rerio ', ' Brachydanio rerio ', ' Zebrafish ', ' Mediating ', ' Apoptosis ', ' Programmed Cell Death ', ' Apoptosis Pathway ', ' Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization ', ' Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization ', ' FISH assay ', ' FISH analysis ', ' FISH Technique ', ' FISH Technic ', ' Label ', ' Site ', ' Malignant -

"Topology of Cancer Evolution and Heterogeneity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In solid tumors, current limitations in our ability to identify the cell(s) of origin, track the dynamics of tumor subclonal architecture over space and time, and predict drug sensitivities in a mechanistic fashion pose significant challenges to our ability to develop effective treatments and undermine the utility of available therapies, particularly in tumors that become resistant. In this proposal, we argue that approaches based in mathematics and physics are well suited for addressing these critical problems. Historically, the physical sciences have been successful in solving fundamental scientific problems by producing reductionist models that enable the development of conceptual premises, technological breakthroughs that enable new kinds of measurements, and mathematical tools that can accurately represent and predict future activity. In this new Columbia University Physical Sciences-Oncology Center for Topology of Cancer Evolution and Heterogeneity (CUPS-OC), our goal is to develop, validate, and deliver a set of complementary mathematical, technological, and computational approaches that will provide the cancer research community with a framework for unraveling complexity in solid tumors, with the long-term aim of improving diagnosis and treatment. More specifically, the Center's primary research focus will be to study evolution and heterogeneity of solid tumors at the single cell level, by developing lineage tracing techniques in organoid and in vivo systems, single cell sequencing in primary tumors, and emerging genomics-based approaches for identifying targeted therapies. These experimental approaches will be supported by the development of novel, robust, and effective mathematical and computational approaches based in the field of topology, which offers unique and powerful methods for addressing the essential challenge of interpreting the high-dimensional data sets that state-of-the- art genomics technologies generate. In addition, we will promote the integration of physical science approaches into cancer research by both training new researchers and engaging established researchers working at the intersection of the physical sciences and cancer biology. Each of the projects and cores will address technical, mathematical, and biological challenges, contributing to the global enterprise of cancer research and to the development of a broader network of interdisciplinary researchers committed to advancing the field. If successful, we will be able to provide the scientific community with experimentally validated geometric and topological structures of causal inference of clonal evolution, single cell genomic protocols for fast and reliable uncovering of clonal heterogeneity, experimentally validated machine learning approaches for predicting drug sensitivities, and a strong multi-institutional, interdisciplinary program that creates bridges between researchers in pure mathematics, the technology sector, and cancer research.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cancer heterogeneity has been postulated as a major evolutionary force behind drug resistance. The Columbia University Physical Sciences-Oncology Center for Topology of Cancer Evolution and Heterogeneity (CUPS-OC) will develop quantitative approaches to understand, study and find potential

"Mechanisms Determining Dysregulation of the NRF2 Oxidative Stress Response in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma ABSTRACT  The principle investigator, Dr. Travis Schrank, MD, PhD, is a first-year faculty member in the University of North Carolina Department of Otolaryngology. He has been hired in a surgeon-scientist role and presently has 75% protected time for research. His past training in computational biophysics and experimental biochemistry have motivated and equipped him pursue an independent research career in computational genomics and head and neck cancer molecular biology. The presented research aims are an outgrowth of the PI's ongoing efforts to improve RNA based methods for identifying NRF2 active head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) tumors.  NRF2 is the key transcriptional regulator of the cellular oxidative stress response, and has been related to poor patient outcome and radiation response in multiple cancer types. Mutational activation of NRF2 is observed in 8% of HPV negative (HPV-) HNSCC. However, our estimates based on RNA transcription suggest that NRF2 is aberrantly activated in 24% of HPV- HNSCC. This work has identified atypical NRF2 and CUL3 variants which are associated with NRF2 activation. The functional consequences of these variants will be investigated (Aim 1). We also find that the prohormone Neurotensin is highly expressed in NRF2 active HNSCC tumors without NRF2 pathway mutations. Our preliminary data suggest that pro-Neurotensin may activate NRF2, through a previously unreported interaction with KEAP1 (a regulator of NRF2 stability). This novel function of pro-Neurotensin will be investigated in Aim 2. Suppression of NRF2 activity is well known to radio-sensitize cancer cells. We have also identified a partially suppressed pattern of NRF2 target expression in HPV associated (HPV+) HNSCC tumors, which are highly sensitive to radiation. p14ARF is also highly expressed in HPV+ HNSCC, binds NRF2, and suppresses transactivation of some NRF2 targets. Aim 3 will explore the hypothesis that NRF2 target suppression due to high levels of p14ARF, contributes to the radio-sensitivity of these tumors.  The proposed work will be impactful for several reasons, 1) the tumor subclassification method developed address the very common problem of imperfect clinical/genomic annotations of tumor RNA expression data, 2) the first known/reported signaling role for the prohormone form of Neurotensin will be explored, and 3) identification of NRF2 targets associated with radiation response may suggest novel approaches to treatment.  UNC has exceptionally strong institutional expertise and resources related to cancer genomics. The mentorship committee also has key project specific expertise in NRF2 biology, computational genomics, p14ARF and Neurotensin. Collectively the mentorship team has previously trained four K award recipients and includes two surgeon-scientists who can provide critical career guidance. PROJECT NARRATIVE Aberrant activation of the transcription factor NRF2, a key regulator of the cellular oxidative stress response, is frequently seen in HPV negative head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and is associated with a poor prognosis. Functionally validated somatic mutations of this pathway can only account for 30% of the observed activation. The objective of this proposal is to identify and characterize novel genomic and proteomic mechanisms of NRF2 activation in order to advance strategies for the diagnosis and targeted treatment of patients with NRF2 active tumors.",Mechanisms Determining Dysregulation of the NRF2 Oxidative Stress Response in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma,10126595,K08DE029241,"['Biochemistry ', '

"A Statistical Physics Framework for Understanding the Role of Repeat RNA in Tumor Immunity PROJECT SUMMARY Transcriptional dysregulation in tumors can induce the abundant expression of repetitive elements in cancerous cells compared to normal tissues, where they are often transcriptionally silent. Such transcripts have been associated with better outcomes to cancer immunotherapies, as they can modulate the tumor immune microenvironment and generate an under-quantified source of tumor neoantigens. Therefore, it has been hypothesized that the aberrant transcription of repeat RNA is both a critical mechanism for initiating the immune response in the tumor microenvironment and an untapped source of potential therapeutic targets. Using a set of approaches from statistical physics, our team predicted repetitive element RNA directly stimulates receptors of the innate immune system, confirmed this hypothesis in a key subset of immune cells, and showed repeat expression can correlate with response to checkpoint blockade immunotherapies. Repeat RNA is therefore both a novel biomarker for the innate immune response in cancer and a potential therapeutic target to modulate tumor immunity. We will utilize a set of tools, developed by our team, from statistical physics to characterize repeat RNA recognition by innate immune receptors in silico and their role in tumor-immune co-evolution, both with and without the application of immunotherapy (Aim 1). Next, we will characterize the spatial context of repeat RNAs in the tumor immune microenvironment and the co-localization of predicted immunostimulatory RNA with activation of immune signaling, along with in depth immune-phenotyping of the state of the immune microenvironment in vivo (Aim 2). Finally, we will perform functional validation of our predictions on human immune cells to validate mechanisms of recognition and the specific immune subsets responsible for repeat recognition via a set of in vitro assays (Aim 3). Our goal is to use approaches from statistical physics to quantify the role of repetitive elements in tumor immunology, their rules of recognition by innate immune receptors and their part in facilitating cytolytic T cell activity. In doing so we will combine novel RNA detection technologies to study their spatial distribution and localization in cancers; state of the art immune-phenotyping; and mathematical models to characterize their direct role in tumor evolution. We hypothesize that our approach from statistical physics will identify the key structural and sequence features of repeat mediated immune activation in solid tumors and shed light on their specific consequences for tumor evolution and therapeutic efficacy. PROJECT NARRATIVE An emerging paradigm in cancer immunology states that the aberrant transcription of repeat RNA in cancer is a critical mechanism for engaging tumor intrinsic and extrinsic immune and regulatory factors, and an untapped source of potential therapeutic targets.

"Towards the automation of MR spectroscopic imaging in patients with glioblashoma Glioblastoma is the most common adult primary brain tumor and is highly aggressive in its disease course. Despite advances in neurosurgical resection, radiation targeting, and chemotherapy, the prognosis remains grim with a median survival of just 15 months. The effectiveness of current radiation therapy strategies is severely limited by shortcomings in the imaging modalities used to develop treatment plans. Current radiation therapy planning is mainly based on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI, which identifies high grade tumors that are immediately associated with leaky neovasculature. Although it is an excellent diagnostic tool to identify high grade from low grade tumors, it is unable to signal occult infiltration beyond the core of the tumor. Though many believe GBM to be an incurable disease, we believe we have identified a method for optimizing tumor targeting that will increase the effectiveness of radiation therapy. A significant component of the current problem in GBM therapy is the lack of treatment for non-enhancing regions that are significantly infiltrated by neoplastic glioma cells without neovascularization. This untreated population undoubtedly leads to early recurrence. The proposed study addresses an important step toward translating an advanced quantitative imaging modality that complements the conventional imaging that is capable of reliably revealing glioma- infiltrated regions for precise, personalized treatment targeting. Proton spectroscopic magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) is an alternative modality able to identify endogenous metabolism within tissue without the need for exogenous contrast, and has been shown to identify the metabolic abnormalities associated with tumor beyond the regions identified by T1-weighted MRI. The clinical integration of sMRI in patient management has been limited due to the computational challenges of analysis of sMRI data. Two key hurdles to be overcome are the insufficiency of filters to remove image artifacts and the necessity of quantification of metabolic levels relative to a patient's baseline metabolism. As a result, sMRI processing requires skilled user intervention and many hours of computational and user time. To automate this pipeline and provide clinically useful information to oncologists, we seek to develop a software framework for the automated and expedient processing of sMRI for use in radiation therapy planning. We will use novel advances in the fields of high performance computing and deep learning, an approach to computation that has shattered benchmarks in many medical and non-medical problems. Specifically, we will develop filters for removing artifacts, algorithms for personalized diagnosis of tumor infiltration, and explore deep learning as a method to synthesize sMRI data with anatomical and clinical metrics in a fully automated fashion. Success in the proposed work will produce a “scanner-to-clinician” platform for quantitative, expedient, and objective analysis methods to integrate sMRI into the clinical radiation therapy planning paradigm. Ultimately, we believe this additional modality in the physician's tool belt will lead to better outcomes in patients suffering from this debilitating disease. Project Narrative  Proton spectroscopic magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) is a molecular imaging modality that can accurately detect abnormalities in the metabolic signatures of tumor cells, making it ideal for the detection and monitoring of highly infiltrative brain tumors like glioblastoma. Clinical adoption of sMRI has been slow due to limited tools for expedient and objective processing of sMRI data into information that oncologists can use for therapy planning. This proposal addresses these challenges using recent advances in high performance computing and machine learning to develop a software framework for using sMRI in the clinical management of patients with glioblastoma.",Towards the automation of MR spectroscopic imaging in patients with glioblashoma,9926827,F30CA206291,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', '

"Quantitative (Perfusion and Diffusion) MRI Biomarkers to Measure Glioma Response Abstract  The continuing goal of our research program is to optimize and disseminate effective imaging-based strategies to personalize brain tumor treatment. Current Response Assessment in NeuroOncology (RANO) criteria, which incorporate anatomic imaging only, are insufficient for distinguishing tumor from treatment effect (TE). Without definitive confirmation of tumor progression, no treatment changes are recommended for several months after standard therapies. Thus, patients are precluded from switching to potentially more effective therapies—a limitation that could be overcome with more reliable imaging techniques.  To this end, during the previous funding cycle, we demonstrated the feasibility of several quantitative imaging (QI) tools to reliably distinguish tumor from treatment effect and predict treatment response. These QI tools include a machine-learning approach to calibrate T1w images enabling the creation of quantitative delta T1 (qDT1) maps. The qDT1 enable the detection of true contrast enhancing lesion volume (CELV). The qDT1 together with our proven dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) MRI methods, for determination of rCBV (relative cerebral blood volume), are used to generate a new biomarker, fractional tumor burden (FTB), to delineate the extent of tumor within CELV on a voxel-wise basis. These perfusion-based QI tools in combination with our diffusion MRI technology, which includes functional diffusion maps (FDMs) and more recently RSI (restriction spectrum imaging), provide a comprehensive assessment of brain tumor and its distinction from treatment effect.  Now, in order to translate this technology for use in clinical trials and daily practice, some final updates and clinical validation studies are needed as proposed here. First, to ease adoption and testing in the clinical setting improvements are proposed for the individual QI technologies along with the development of a streamlined workflow (Aim 1). To improve the widespread adoption of DSC-MRI and FTB biomarker, studies will be performed to confirm that a single-dose DSC-MRI method can replace the standard double-dose method without affecting the accuracy of rCBV or the creation of FTB maps (Aim 1.1). Also, registration and segmentation algorithms will be updated to include deformable registration and recent advances in deep learning for longitudinal reporting of CELV, non-enhancing lesion volumes (NELV) and each of the QI metrics (Aim 1.2). Finally, a streamlined workflow that incorporates these improvements will be created (Aim 1.3). The Aim 2 studies will test the QI tools and workflow using clinical trial data (Aim 2.1-2.2) and daily clinical practice (Aim 2.3-2.4).  Clinical validation of this new QI-RANO workflow, with evidence showing improved prediction in comparison to current measures, has the potential to cause a paradigm shift in how brain tumor burden is assessed. Project Narrative The goal of our research program is to optimize and disseminate effective quantitative imaging (QI)-based strategies to provide earlier indications of brain tumor treatment response than is currently available. The QI tools, which include novel quantitative measures of enhancing lesion (qDT1), relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV), fractional tumor burden (FTB) and functional diffusion maps (fDM) will be updated and validated in the context of clinical trials. Working in close collaboration with an industrial partner, the proven methods will be translated into a software platform for widespread use within the quantitative imaging network (QIN), and for both clinical trials and daily standard of care.",Quantitative (Perfusion and Diffusion) MRI Biomarkers to Measure Glioma Response,10006506,U01CA176110,"['Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Brain Neoplasms ', ' Brain Neoplasia ', ' Brain Tumors ', ' tumors in the brain ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Diffusion ', ' Glioma ', ' Glial Cell Tumors ', ' Glial Neoplasm ', ' Glial Tumor ', ' Neuroglial Neoplasm ', ' Neuroglial Tumor ', ' glial-derived tumor ', ' neuroglia neoplasm ', ' neuroglia tumor ', ' Goals ', ' Industrialization ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Perfusion ', ' Research ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' cancer progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' tumor progression ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' chemo-/radio-therapy ', ' chemo-radio-therapy ', ' chemo-radiotherapy ', ' chemoradiotherapy ', ' radio-chemo-therapy ', ' radio-chemotherapy ', ' radiochemotherapy ', ' chemoradiation ', ' novel ', ' validation studies ', ' Reporting ', ' Anti-VEGF ', ' Anti-VEGF Humanized Monoclonal Antibody ', ' Anti-VEGF RhuMAb ', ' MoAb VEGF ', ' Monoclonal Antibody Anti-VEGF ', ' Recombinant Humanized Anti-VEGF Monoclonal Antibody ', ' Recombinant Humanized Monoclonal Antibody to Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor ', ' RhuMAb VEGF ', ' rhuMabVEGF ', ' bevacizumab ', ' response ', ' DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) ', ' DWI-MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion weighted imaging ', ' Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' dMRI ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Contrast-Enhancing Lesion ', ' Gadolinium-Enhancing Lesion ', ' Gd-Enhancing Lesion ', ' Enhancing Lesion ', ' Dose ', ' Tumor Load ', ' Tumor Burden ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Imaging Instrument ', ' Imaging Tool ', ' Imaging Device ', ' predict therapeutic response ', ' predict therapy response ', ' predict treatment response ', ' therapy prediction ', ' treatment prediction ', ' treatment response prediction ', ' Prediction of Response to Therapy ', ' RTOG ', ' Radiation Therapy Oncology Group ', ' ACRIN ', ' American College of Radiology Imaging Network ', ' Update ', ' Validation ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Imaging technology ', ' treatment effect ', ' tumor ', ' neurooncology ', ' neuro-oncology ', ' standard of care ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' treatment response ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' clinical practice ', ' quantitative imaging ', ' Restriction Spectral Imaging ', ' Restriction Spectrum Imaging ', ' cerebral blood volume ', ' prediction of response ', ' predictive response ', ' predictor of response ', ' response prediction ', ' predicting response ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' outcome prediction ', ' MRI biomarker ', ' magnetic resonance imaging biomarker ', ' anatomical imaging ', ' anatomic imaging ', ' deep learning ', ' segmentation algorithm ', ' ']",NCI,MEDICAL COLLEGE OF WISCONSIN,U01,2020,559217,WI-05,0.12668265724641653
"Brain Cancer Radio-Pathomics for Predicting Heterogeneous Cytology Abstract High-grade brain cancer (glioblastoma) is a devastating disease that very few patients survive long-term. The average life expectancy is 15 months, and throughout therapy patients undergo serial MR imaging for monitoring tumor response. It is not well understood how heterogeneity at the cellular and molecular levels affects the macroscopic imaging characteristics of these tumors.  The long-term goal of this project is to provide imaging tools and biomarker integration strategies for individualizing glioblastoma treatment. The overall objective is to combine radiographic imaging with histopathological samples (i.e., radio-pathomics) to create and validate predictive tools for accurately defining tumor margins and spatial molecular profiles. Our central hypothesis is that microscopic glioblastoma cytological features and spatially dependent molecular profiles are reliably detectable and quantifiable with macroscopic MR imaging. Two specific aims will objectively test this hypothesis by first determining which microscopic tissue features contribute to distinct measurements with MR imaging, and second, determining the performance of machine learning algorithms for predictively mapping these heterogeneous histological features. ! Project Narrative This project will provide a detailed understanding of how brain tumors at the cellular level appear on macroscopic imaging by examining whole brain human samples and clinical MRI scans. We will develop computational algorithms trained with histology to recognize patterns in MRI scans (i.e. radiopathomics), which will negate the need for tissue.

"The CSBC Research Center for Cancer Systems Immunology at MSKCC SUMMARY Exciting clinical breakthroughs with checkpoint blockade antibodies and adoptive T cell transfers have transformed the field of cancer immunotherapy, demonstrating the power of harnessing the immune system to eliminate cancer cells. However, fundamental challenges and questions remain. Significant clinical responses have only been observed in a subset of patients and cancer types, and it is currently not known what biological properties of tumors determine clinical responses, nor what strategies to adopt in clinical contexts where current immunotherapies are ineffective. To ultimately address these clinical challenges and to design predictably effective cancer treatments, we must deepen our fundamental understanding of interactions between tumors and the immune system at the molecular, cellular, and systems levels. The CSBC Research Center for Cancer Systems Immunology at MSKCC will bring the tools of systems biology to investigate cancer-immune system interactions at multiple stages of disease progression to answer central questions in cancer immunology and inform the design of novel immunotherapeutic interventions. We have organized our Research Center around three central scientific projects that examine cancer-immune interactions at distinct stages of disease progression: cancer initiation and early tumorigenesis (Project I); established and progressing tumors (Project II); latent disease and metastasis in (Project III). In Project I, we will combine new epigenomics technologies and innovative single-cell analyses with state-of-the-art systems biology approaches to decipher the underlying molecular and epigenetic programs of dysfunctional tumor- specific T cell differentiation in early tumorigenesis. We will further elucidate how dynamics in the mutational tumor antigen landscape and stromal and immune cell populations determine such states and model and test in mouse and human tumors how distinct T cell states determine sensitivity to immune checkpoint blockade. In Project II, we will use quantitative analysis of cell types and cell states by functional, flow cytometric, population RNA-seq and droplet RNA sequencing together with ecological models of cancer, immune, and stromal cell populations to study the response of the tumor ecosystem to immunotherapeutic perturbations in established tumors. In Project III, we will examine the evolutionary dynamics of innate immune system control of metastatic disease, a new area of investigation in cancer immunology. We will investigate the heterogeneity of latent cancer cells in their capacity for immune evasion, and we will use quantitative methods, including live cell imaging, to model latent tumor cell evasion of innate immune control and the dynamics of cycles of latent cell proliferation and potential editing by NK cells. A Shared Resource Core will provide state-of-the-art single-cell droplet sequencing technology and computational analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data (scRNA- seq). This Shared Resource Core will be tasked with droplet sequencing technology development and design of novel algorithmic approaches and will interact with all three scientific Projects. Our Research Center will also carry out an innovative program of outreach and training activities at the local, national, and global levels to disseminate research findings in cancer systems immunology and to train young scientists in this emerging field. NARRATIVE Cancer immunotherapies are designed to harness the human immune system to attack cancer cells and eliminate tumors. Recent breakthroughs in cancer immunotherapy, such as checkpoint blockade agents, have generated great excitement, but in fact only a fraction of patients and tumor types respond to these new treatments. Our proposed Research Center will deploy tools from systems biology to study tumor-immune system interactions at multiple stages to disease progression at the molecular, cellular, and systems levels,

"Clinical Translation of Stimulated Raman Histology Accurate intraoperative tissue diagnosis is central to medical decision making during brain tumor surgery. Existing intraoperative histologic techniques deplete scant tissue biopsies, introduce freezing artifacts, and rely on highly- skilled technicians and neuropathologists working in dedicated surgical pathology laboratories to produce and interpret slides. In addition, the number of centers where brain tumor surgery is performed far exceeds the number of board-certified neuropathologists, eliminating the possibility for expert consultation in many cases. Even in the most advanced, well-staffed hospitals, turnaround time for intraoperative pathology poses a major barrier for the efficient delivery of surgical care, highlighting the need for an improved system for rapid diagnosis. Stimulated Raman histology (SRH) creates high-resolution digital microscopic images of unprocessed tissue specimens in a fraction of the time of conventional techniques and eliminates reliance on a frozen section laboratory for sectioning, staining, mounting and reviewing slides. While SRH has been shown to reveal key diagnostic histologic features in brain tumor specimens, major technical hurdles related to laser safety and performance have hindered its clinical translation. The existing academic-industrial partnership between established collaborators has resulted in the development and initial validation of a clinically-compatible SRH microscope in a patient care setting (Nature Biomedical Engineering 1:0027, 2017). We have demonstrated that SRH has diagnostic value comparable to conventional histologic techniques and that SRH images are well-suited for interpretation via an automated machine learning algorithm. The proposed research program represents a multi-disciplinary (neurosurgery, neuropathology, biostatistics, computer science and medical device manufacturing) academic-industry partnership to accelerate the development of an SRH imager for use during brain tumor surgery. The overall goal of the partnership is to create pathways for online collaboration between surgeons and pathologists using the SRH imager, provide strong evidence for the utility of SRH in the setting of a prospective randomized controlled trial and to enhance our capabilities for automated intraoperative diagnosis employing state-of the-art image classification methods including convolutional neural networks. Once completed, this research program will improve the care of brain tumor patients by streamlining the process for intraoperative diagnosis. It will also create a pathway for remote and automated diagnosis, extending expertise in neuropathology to more centers caring for brain tumor patients. SRH technology combined with algorithms for automated intraoperative diagnosis create the possibility of advancing the larger field of surgical oncology where histologic information is essential for making surgical decisions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Existing techniques for creating histologic images of tissue during surgery are time-consuming, prone to error, may complicate diagnosis and surgical-decision making. We have developed an optical imaging technology which streamlines tissue diagnosis during surgery, enabling a uniform workflow that will improve the care of cancer patients. Through this academic-industrial partnership of successful collaborators, we aim to accumulate data which will propel this emerging technology towards becoming the new standard of care for intraoperative histology.",Clinical Translation of Stimulated Raman Histology,9987579,R01CA226527,"['Archives ', ' Biomedical Engineering ', ' bio-engineered ', ' bio-engineers ', ' bioengineering ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biopsy ', ' Brain Neoplasms ', ' Brain Neoplasia ', ' Brain Tumors ', ' tumors in the brain ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Consultations ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diagnostic Imaging ', ' Freezing ', ' Frozen Sections ', ' Freeze Sectioning ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Histological Techniques ', ' Histologic Technics ', ' Histologic Techniques ', ' Histological Technics ', ' Histology ', ' Hospitals ', ' Intraoperative Care ', ' Peroperative Care ', ' intra-operative care ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lasers ', ' Laser Electromagnetic ', ' Laser Radiation ', ' Medical Device ', ' Methods ', ' neurosurgery ', ' Operating Rooms ', ' Pathology ', ' Surgical Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Safety ', ' Stains ', ' Staining method ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Measures ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' Microscope ', ' improved ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Histologically ', ' Histologic ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Collaborations ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Pathologist ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' programs ', ' Slide ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' Medical center ', ' Surgeon ', ' American ', ' Performance ', ' rapid diagnosis ', ' Accuracy of Diagnosis ', ' diagnostic accuracy ', ' computer science ', ' Structure ', ' neuropathology ', ' cancer care ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' oncologic surgery ', ' Surgical Oncology ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Emergent Technologies ', ' Emerging Technologies ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Output ', ' optic imaging ', ' optical imaging ', ' virtual ', ' digital ', ' Imaging technology ', ' prospective ', ' Consumption ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' Graphical interface ', ' graphic user interface ', ' software user interface ', ' graphical user interface ', ' neurooncology ', ' neuro-oncology ', ' standard of care ', ' industrial partnership ', ' industry partnership ', ' industry partner ', ' imaging system ', ' Tissue imaging ', ' microscope imaging ', ' microscopy imaging ', ' microscopic imaging ', ' histologic image ', ' histological image ', ' clinical translation ', ' imager ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' DICOM ', ' Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' Computer Models ', ' data centers ', ' automatic algorithm ', ' automated algorithm ', ' ']",NCI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,525328,NY-12,0.1130551632498513
"Multimodal Biomarkers For Oropharyngeal Cancer Abstract Head and neck cancers are the fifth most common cancer type in the United States, with an overall survival rate lower than 50%. Although the incidence of other sub-sites of head and neck cancer has decreased steadily in past decades, the number of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) cases has increased significantly. Most OPSCC patients receive standard cancer therapy.4 However, the clinical outcomes vary significantly and are difficult to predict. Predicting early in treatment whether a tumor is likely to respond to treatment is one of the most difficult yet important tasks in providing individualized cancer care.  Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a known driving oncogenic factor in oropharyngeal cancer, as well as a significant prognostic biomarker for patient survival. Retrospective studies conducted by the International Head and Neck Cancer Epidemiology Consortium (INHANCE) have demonstrated that clinical biomarkers have prognostic value in helping stratify OPSCC patients into groups with differing risks of death or disease progression. However, HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer patients have similar rates of metastatic spread to HPV-negative patients. The same is true for patient groups stratified with other clinical biomarkers. More robust prognostic biomarkers are needed to accurately stratify patients for optimally effective treatment.  MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of small non-coding RNA molecules that collectively control the expression of thousands of protein-coding genes. Multiple studies indicate that miRNAs are promising cancer biomarkers and play critical regulatory roles in oropharyngeal cancer. Imaging features extracted from medical images are an exciting new class of cancer biomarkers for characterizing tumor habitats. For several tumor sites, imaging biomarkers have shown promise in accurately separating favorable and unfavorable prognosis patients. However, current efforts to utilize high-dimensional multimodal biomarkers for treatment outcome prediction have been compromised by small patient numbers relative to the feature space dimensionality; feature redundancy, heterogeneity, and uncertainty; and patient cohorts with unbalanced outcomes. The correlation, independence, and complementary nature of multimodal biomarkers (imaging, miRNA, HPV, clinical, and histopathologic biomarkers) remains unexplored as well.  The major goal of this research is to develop a multimodal biomarker-based model that can reliably predict subsets of OPSCC patients with low and high risks for treatment failure. The model will serve as a clinical decision-making tool. Specifically, we propose a novel principle and systematic machine learning-based strategy to effectively identify and seamlessly combine prognostic information carried by multimodal biomarkers. Aim 1: Identify prognostic multimodal biomarkers, given OPSCC patient data. Aim 2: Develop and test a comprehensive multimodal biomarker-based model for predicting OPSCC treatment outcomes. Aim 3: Assess the clinical benefit of the model for OPSCC patient stratification and individualized treatment. Narrative The achievement of this project forms a basis of combining non-invasive imaging biomarkers with miRNAs, HPV, clinical, and histopathologic biomarkers for accurate cancer prognosis and discovering the correlation with genetic mechanisms leading to specific tumor phenotypes. This clinical decision-making tool can provide useful information to support patient stratification and individualized treatment. We anticipate that many of the methodological improvements established in this proposal will improve oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma treatment and tumor response assessment and treatment in other disease sites as well.",Multimodal Biomarkers For Oropharyngeal Cancer,9994253,R01CA233873,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Decision Making ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Incidence ', ' Human Papillomavirus ', ' HPV ', ' Human Papilloma Virus ', ' Infectious Human Wart Virus ', ' wart virus ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methodology ', ' Oropharyngeal Neoplasms ', ' Oropharyngeal Tumor ', ' Oropharynx Neoplasms ', ' Oropharynx Tumor ', ' oral pharyngeal neoplasm ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prognosis ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Retrospective Studies ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' Malignant Oropharyngeal Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Oropharyngeal Tumor ', ' Oropharnyx Cancers ', ' Oropharyngeal Cancer ', ' Oropharyngeal Carcinoma ', ' Oropharynx Cancer ', ' Oropharynx Carcinoma ', ' malignant oropharynx tumor ', ' malignant oropharynx neoplasm ', ' therapy failure ', ' Treatment Failure ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' prognostic ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Malignant Head and Neck Neoplasm ', ' head/neck cancer ', ' malignant head and neck tumor ', ' Head and Neck Cancer ', ' Oropharyngeal Epidermoid Carcinoma ', ' oropharynx epidermoid carcinoma ', ' oropharynx squamous cell carcinoma ', ' Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Dimensions ', ' Techniques ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Habitats ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' cancer therapy ', ' cancer epidemiology ', ' Micro RNA ', ' miRNA ', ' miRNAs ', ' MicroRNAs ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Molecular Marker of Prognosis ', ' Prognosis Marker ', ' prognostic biomarker ', ' prognostic indicator ', ' Prognostic Marker ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Cancer Prognosis ', ' trial regimen ', ' trial treatment ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' Validation ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Outcome ', ' cancer type ', ' Oncogenic ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical applicability ', ' clinical application ', ' tumor ', ' high risk ', ' multi-modality ', ' multimodality ', ' treatment strategy ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' noninvasive imaging ', ' non-invasive imaging ', ' individualized cancer care ', ' personalized oncology ', ' precision cancer care ', ' precision cancer medicine ', ' precision oncology ', ' customized therapy ', ' customized treatment ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' individualized therapy ', ' individualized treatment ', ' patient specific therapies ', ' patient specific treatment ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' tailored therapy ', ' tailored treatment ', ' unique treatment ', ' individualized medicine ', ' prognostic ability ', ' prognostic power ', ' prognostic utility ', ' prognostic value ', ' imaging marker ', ' imaging-based biological marker ', ' imaging-based biomarker ', ' imaging-based marker ', ' imaging biomarker ', ' stratified patient ', ' patient stratification ', ' cancer markers ', ' cancer biomarkers ', ' clinically useful biomarkers ', ' clinical biomarkers ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' outcome prediction ', ' patient biomarkers ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' patient subsets ', ' miRNA biomarkers ', ' miRNA markers ', ' microRNA markers ', ' microRNA biomarkers ', ' high dimensionality ', ' death risk ', ' mortality risk ', ' Patient imaging ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' Computer Models ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R01,2020,416519,IL-13,0.08411500308422826
"Harnessing protease activity for predictive monitoring of cancer immunotherapy Project Summary/Abstract The blockade of inhibitory immune checkpoints has transformed the treatment of cancer for patients across a broad range of malignancies. Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) is achieved by administering antibodies that block the cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) or the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) pathway to reinvigorate antitumor T cell activity. Despite treatment responses that are unprecedented and durable, the majority of patients do not experience a clinical benefit from treatment, and some responders relapse and acquire resistance. Moreover, response patterns of tumors treated with ICB are unconventional, and can be misinterpreted as disease progression by radiographic imaging. To maximize the precision and benefit of ICB therapy, identification of predictive and pharmacodynamic biomarkers to objectively assess immune responses has rapidly emerged as a clinical priority. The proposal aims to leverage protease activity as predictive biomarkers for monitoring ICB response and resistance. Proteases play a central role in the underlying biology of immunity, oncology, and anti-tumor responses. The mark of a “hot” tumor is signified by an effective immune infiltrate of cytotoxic T cells that lyse cancer cells via the classical perforin- and granzyme-mediated pathway – the latter of which comprise a family of potent serine proteases. Tumor expression of proteases, including inflammatory and matrix degrading proteases, is well-established as a hallmark of fundamental tumor processes including angiogenesis, growth, and metastasis. The central hypothesis is that quantifying the activity of T cell and tumor proteases early-on-treatment will allow identification of activity biomarkers that predict treatment efficacy and indicate resistance to ICB therapy. To achieve these goals, this proposal aims to develop a new class of checkpoint blockade antibodies that are endowed with the dual capacity to inhibit immune checkpoints and sense protease activity during treatment responses. These activity sensing ICB diagnostics, or IDB-Dx, comprise -PD-1 or -CTLA-4 antibodies that are site-specifically functionalized with a library of mass-barcoded peptide substrates. During responses to ICB, these peptides are cleaved by T cell and tumor proteases that are elevated in “hot” tumors, liberating a unique fingerprint of mass barcodes that are then filtered into the recipient’s urine for quantification by mass spectrometry. By applying machine learning algorithms, these signatures of protease activity are trained and validated as predictive classifiers to discriminate “hot” and “cold” tumors, responders from non-responders, and resistance to therapy. Project Narrative Cancer immunotherapy using immune checkpoint blockade is transforming the treatment of cancer patients. Although some patients experience durable responses, new methods are required to identify patient responders, evaluate unconventional immune responses, and detect immune resistance. We propose to develop a new class of checkpoint blockade therapies that harness protease activity for predictive monitoring of treatment response and resistance.",Harnessing protease activity for

"Quantitative Multimodal Image Guidance for Improved Liver Cancer Treatment Project Summary/Abstract  Liver cancer is the second most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide and is likely to grow even more in the next decade given the epidemic levels of hepatitis B and C and the emergence of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) due to obesity in the US. Most liver cancer patients present with disease that cannot be treated surgically. Minimally invasive, catheter-based, intra-arterial therapies such as TACE (transarterial chemoembolization) have become the mainstay therapy and are included in all treatment guidelines because of their ability to achieve local tumor control and extend survival. TACE overcomes the problem of chemoresistance in cancer cells by delivering high dose chemotherapy through image guidance and embolization of the tumor feeding blood vessel. TACE most commonly uses an oily medium (Lipiodol) as a radiopaque drug delivery mate- rial by creating an emulsion between drugs and oil. The recent introduction of drug-eluting bead (DEB) technol- ogy provides an opportunity to achieve the goal of controlled and sustainable drug release to tumors, which was not possible with oily TACE. Although TACE clearly improves patient survival, limitations still exist – speciﬁcally, incomplete treatment and tumor recurrence – attributed to the stimulation of angiogenesis. Most of these issues can be addressed with a greater understanding of the tumor microenvironment, in particular the relationship that exists between hypoxia, acidosis and angiogenesis. In fact, the development of imaging biomarkers reﬂecting changes within the tumor microenvironment is increasingly being pursued to individualize cancer therapies and increase their potency. Yet, our ability to characterize the tumor microenvironment using current imaging tech- nology is extremely limited. TACE has had to rely on 2D X-ray angiography until recently when the emergence of intra-procedural dual phase cone beam CT (DP-CBCT) contributed signiﬁcantly to improving tumor visualization, microcatheter guidance, and treatment endpoint. It is precisely through the longstanding close partnership be- tween Philips, Johns Hopkins and now Yale that this technology was optimized and became broadly accepted as the new standard of practice for TACE, demonstrating the prompt successful translation of research ﬁndings to clinical practice. However, the targeting of tumors and assessment of outcomes continues to be limited, relying on qualitative/semi-quantitative enhancement patterns from DP-CBCT and single parameter MR images. The unique partnership between Yale & Philips provides innovative technology that will directly enhance the role of image-guided intervention and address this unmet need by quantitatively characterizing the tumor microenvi- ronment and tumor tissue composition in order to maximize treatment potency and improve outcomes. We will integrate advanced, multiparameter MR with active CBCT imaging and create valuable biomarkers derived from novel machine learning methods for image and data analysis. By providing essential, quantitative information, drug delivery to tumors can be maximized because it will be based on inherent tumor properties. In the same way, the assessment of therapy will be much more precise and therefore useful to identify responders. Project Narrative This grant is aimed at enhancing our ability to deliver minimally invasive catheter-based treatments for liver cancer using drug delivery platforms which simultaneously embolize the tumor vasculature and locally deliver chemotherapy agents, and assess their efﬁcacy. At the core of the effort is the development, evaluation and translation to clinical practice of advanced imaging and analysis methods to characterize the tumor microen- vironment and derive feature information from novel multiparameter, multimodal images to classify tissue and quantify the response to therapy. The resulting methodology will lead to improved patient care through more precise delivery and more accurate response assessment.",Quantitative Multimodal Image Guidance for Improved Liver Cancer

"Integrated Discovery Pipeline for Tumor Neoantigens Project Summary Cancer immunotherapy is now established as a major therapeutic modality. Significant progress with checkpoint inhibitor monoclonal antibodies demonstrates durable tumor regression in metastatic melanoma, lung cancer and other malignancies. One conspicuous limitation is the paucity of validated tumor antigens, which impedes clinical investigators in their pursuit of developing new cancer immunotherapies. Tumor encoded non-synonymous mutations may provide a new source of potential target antigens. T cells recognize tumor missense mutations as amino acid substituted peptides presented in the context of major histocompatibility molecules on the cancer cell surface, thus implicating missense mutations as a source of patient-specific neoantigens. We recently described the first-in-human study to use next generation sequencing technologies to identify and validate tumor missense mutations as neoantigens. Our study demonstrates that vaccination increases the breadth and diversity of neoantigen-specific T cells resulting in a broad repertoire of effector CD8+ T cells that uniquely discriminates mutated antigens from wild type peptides ensuring tumor specificity. This proposal aims to find a unique solution to the scarcity of tumor antigens by developing a neoantigen discovery pipeline that integrates genomic and proteomic technologies. In this proposal, a unique academic-industry partnership comprised of an established team of experts, in cancer genomics, cancer proteomics, human immunology, and clinical oncology, aim to solve the challenging problem of tumor neoantigen discovery. The long-term goal is to develop a robust pipeline using cutting-edge technologies merged with machine learning algorithms to supply tumor neoantigens for clinical investigation. The goal of this proposal will be addressed in the experiments of the following specific aims: 1) to identify the repertoire of melanoma expressed somatic mutations by next generation sequencing technologies; 2) to develop a novel proteomics platform to identify melanoma neoantigens presented by HLA class I molecules; 3) to validate neoantigen identification in a vaccination protocol. The proposed pipeline will deliver a transformative solution for tumor antigen identification, should be translatable to other “immune responsive“ malignancies and enable the nascent discipline of precision medicine to provide effective and safe immunotherapies for cancer patients. Project Narrative This project is relevant to public health as it aims to develop a neoantigen discovery pipeline to address the paucity of validated cancer antigens available for immunotherapy. The pipeline integrates two powerful and well-established technologies, genomics and proteomics. If successful, this pipeline will enable the delivery of precision immunotherapy in a clinically relevant timeframe for patients with melanoma as well as other malignancies.",Integrated Discovery

"Topology of Cancer Evolution and Heterogeneity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In solid tumors, current limitations in our ability to identify the cell(s) of origin, track the dynamics of tumor subclonal architecture over space and time, and predict drug sensitivities in a mechanistic fashion pose significant challenges to our ability to develop effective treatments and undermine the utility of available therapies, particularly in tumors that become resistant. In this proposal, we argue that approaches based in mathematics and physics are well suited for addressing these critical problems. Historically, the physical sciences have been successful in solving fundamental scientific problems by producing reductionist models that enable the development of conceptual premises, technological breakthroughs that enable new kinds of measurements, and mathematical tools that can accurately represent and predict future activity. In this new Columbia University Physical Sciences-Oncology Center for Topology of Cancer Evolution and Heterogeneity (CUPS-OC), our goal is to develop, validate, and deliver a set of complementary mathematical, technological, and computational approaches that will provide the cancer research community with a framework for unraveling complexity in solid tumors, with the long-term aim of improving diagnosis and treatment. More specifically, the Center's primary research focus will be to study evolution and heterogeneity of solid tumors at the single cell level, by developing lineage tracing techniques in organoid and in vivo systems, single cell sequencing in primary tumors, and emerging genomics-based approaches for identifying targeted therapies. These experimental approaches will be supported by the development of novel, robust, and effective mathematical and computational approaches based in the field of topology, which offers unique and powerful methods for addressing the essential challenge of interpreting the high-dimensional data sets that state-of-the- art genomics technologies generate. In addition, we will promote the integration of physical science approaches into cancer research by both training new researchers and engaging established researchers working at the intersection of the physical sciences and cancer biology. Each of the projects and cores will address technical, mathematical, and biological challenges, contributing to the global enterprise of cancer research and to the development of a broader network of interdisciplinary researchers committed to advancing the field. If successful, we will be able to provide the scientific community with experimentally validated geometric and topological structures of causal inference of clonal evolution, single cell genomic protocols for fast and reliable uncovering of clonal heterogeneity, experimentally validated machine learning approaches for predicting drug sensitivities, and a strong multi-institutional, interdisciplinary program that creates bridges between researchers in pure mathematics, the technology sector, and cancer research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cancer heterogeneity has been postulated as a major evolutionary force behind drug resistance. The Columbia University Physical Sciences-Oncology Center for Topology of Cancer Evolution and Heterogeneity (CUPS-OC) will develop quantitative approaches to understand, study and find potential novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of solid tumors.

"Software Solution for Clinical Management of Musculoskeletal Tumors PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Bone lesions are frequently encountered during every day clinical practice. Benign bone lesions, such as a small enchondroma, can be left alone and are unlikely to impact the patient during their lifetime. However, a malignant bone lesion, such as an osteosarcoma, will require a biopsy and surgical resection. Determining which lesions require treatment and which can be left alone can be a daunting process. Whether a bone lesion requires a biopsy depends on both clinical- and imaging-based factors(1–3). Advanced patient age, presence of pain, and history of prior malignancy can influence the need for biopsy. For imaging, various lesion-based parameters such as location, matrix, tumor margin, presence of soft tissue component, and periosteal reaction can help determine whether the lesion is aggressive or non-aggressive, with aggressive lesions needing a biopsy. Aggressive lesions are more likely to represent a malignancy, althought there are some benign processes that can have an aggressive imaging appearance (i.e osteomyelitis, fractures).  Misdiagnoses of malignant tumors as benign prevents needed treatment from occurring; however, benign lesions should not be unnecessarily biopsied, as this can lead to unneeded tests, biopsy complications, increased health care costs, and patient anxiety. Currently, the decision to biopsy or not is made by the clinician, considering the clinical- and imaging-based factors, which can be very subjective. Studies have shown that misdiagnosis is higher if these cases are not discussed under multidisciplinary review with input from an orthopedic oncologist, radiologist, and pathologist. Also, if the imaging studies are not interpreted by subspecialty trained musculoskeletal (MSK) radiologists, reading discrepancy of up to 28% can occur. Moreover, a recent study by Zamora et al. showed that there is poor inter-observer agreement amongst experienced orthopedic oncologists for distinguishing enchondromas and chondrosarcomas, a common clinical dilemma.  Therefore, we propose to develop a method to analyze the radiologic studies directly, extract important lesion-based features of the bone tumors and auto-classify the lesions as non-aggressive or aggressive. By using CT scans from 200 biopsied bone lesions, utilizing a deep learning approach to extract image features and access to patients' clinical-based factors, we will develop a machine learning tool to differentiate between non- aggressive and aggressive tumors and compare the results to definitive histologic confirmation of disease. We hypothesize that the proposed machine learning based software will classify aggressive vs. non- aggressive lesions as accurately as definitive histologic confirmation of disease state. The aims of the study are to: 1) Develope bone and lesion segmentation and bone-lesion feature extraction software tools for physician classification; and 2) Develope a software tool to auto-classify femur lesions as either aggressive or non-aggressive. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Bone tumors are frequently encountered during every day clinical practice. Non-aggressive bone tumors can often be left alone. However, an aggressive bone tumor typically requires a biopsy and subsequent surgery. Determining which lesions require treatment and which can be left alone can be a daunting process.

"Implementation of Machine Learning Workflows in Primary Brain Tumor Diagnostics Abstract The diagnosis of primary brain tumors requires a layered approach of histologic, anatomic and molecular features to generate an integrated diagnosis with clinical and prognostic significance. The diagnostic workup of diffuse gliomas in particular requires a panel of immunohistochemical stains with a subset of tumors requiring additional molecular testing to reach a diagnostic category recognized by the World Health Organization. In the United States and worldwide, scarce resources are available to perform these tests, so methods that improve pre-test probabilities and decrease false positive results have significant clinical and financial impact. Our long-term goal is to improve and standardize testing and diagnoses for brain tumor patients worldwide by validating new diagnostic workflows using digital imaging, immunohistochemical tests, open source computing platforms and machine learning algorithms to improve diagnostic capabilities. We will achieve these goals by completing three specific aims in this R03 Pilot/Feasibility project. First, we will determine the extent to which predictive diagnostic models developed from public domain data show generalizability to cases evaluated at a tertiary brain cancer care center. We have already generated a prototype statistical predictive model, which we will expand to all CNS tumor types and test with data from patients at James Cancer Hospital. Second, we will generate and validate models that predict the probability of false-positive 1p/19q FISH testing using histological features from OLIG2-immunostained brain tumor slides obtained from whole slide imaging. Lastly, we will consolidate data containing whole slide digital images, immunohistochemical features, clinical data and molecular features of diffuse gliomas. Consolidating these data will allow us to begin data analysis correlating histological images to immunohistochemical and molecular features. This dataset will represent the core dataset that upon which we will base our next R01-level proposal. To achieve these goals, we have assembled a multidisciplinary team composed of an image analysis expert and neuropathologist (JO), a molecular neuropathologist (DT), and a high dimensionality bioinformaticist (JZ). The Ohio State University is the first US cancer center to transition to complete whole slide imaging, and therefore we are in a unique position to generate a significant, vertical advance in improving diagnostic accuracy in neuropathology with modern Pathology Informatics approaches. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will develop predictive models of cancer diagnoses and consolidate various forms of patient data into one centralized source for research. This new knowledge will ultimately serve as the framework upon which interventions are designed that may improve morbidity and mortality of patients with primary brain tumors. Therefore, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge that will help reduce the burdens of human disease.",Implementation of Machine Learning Workflows in Primary Brain Tumor Diagnostics,9954242,R03NS116334,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Biotechnology ', ' Biotech ', ' Brain Neoplasms ', ' Brain Neoplasia ', ' Brain Tumors ', ' tumors in the brain ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Chromosomes ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Evolution ', ' Glioma ', ' Glial Cell Tumors ', ' Glial Neoplasm ', ' Glial Tumor ', ' Neuroglial Neoplasm ', ' Neuroglial Tumor ', ' glial-derived tumor ', ' neuroglia neoplasm ', ' neuroglia tumor ', ' Goals ', ' Hospitals ', ' Cancer Hospital ', ' Immunohistochemistry ', ' Immunohistochemistry Cell/Tissue ', ' Immunohistochemistry Staining Method ', ' Incidence ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Institutes ', ' Insurance ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mission ', ' Modernization ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Ohio ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Probability ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Stains ', ' Staining method ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Triage ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' World Health Organization ', ' Central Nervous System Neoplasms ', ' CNS Tumor ', ' CNS neoplasm ', ' Central Nervous System Tumors ', ' tumors in the central nervous system ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Brain Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Brain ', ' Malignant neoplasm of brain ', ' Public Domains ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Clinical ', ' Diffuse ', ' Histologically ', ' Histologic ', ' Series ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Morphology ', ' Pathologist ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Slide ', ' Source ', ' Country ', ' CDK4I ', ' CDKN2 ', ' CDKN2 Genes ', ' CDKN2A ', ' CMM2 ', ' Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor 2A Gene ', ' INK4 ', ' INK4A ', ' MTS1 ', ' MTS1 Genes ', ' TP16 ', ' TSG9A ', ' p14ARF ', ' p16 Genes ', ' p16INK4 Genes ', ' p16INK4A Genes ', ' p16INK4a ', ' CDKN2A gene ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' computer imaging ', ' digital imaging ', ' mutant ', ' Accuracy of Diagnosis ', ' diagnostic accuracy ', ' Informatics ', ' Categories ', ' Modality ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Primary Brain Tumors ', ' Primary Brain Neoplasms ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' neuropathology ', ' cancer care ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' US State ', ' Geographic state ', ' Data ', ' Predictive Cancer Model ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Chromosome 19 Distal Arm ', ' Chromosome 19 Long Arm ', ' 19q ', ' Molecular ', ' cost ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinically significant ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' open source ', ' human disease ', ' new diagnostics ', ' next generation diagnostics ', ' novel diagnostics ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy design ', ' prototype ', ' tumor ', ' FDA approved ', ' NGS Method ', ' NGS system ', ' next gen sequencing ', ' nextgen sequencing ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' sequencing platform ', ' histologic image ', ' histological image ', ' expression subtypes ', ' molecular sub-types ', ' molecular subsets ', ' molecular subtypes ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' prognostic significance ', ' high dimensionality ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databanks ', ' data depository ', ' data repository ', ' data warehouse ', ' whole slide imaging ', ' Infrastructure ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' Data Scientist ', ' computing platform ', ' computational platform ', ' large data sets ', ' large datasets ', ' algorithm training ', ' ']",NINDS,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R03,2020,156000,OH-03,0.14651237715670934
"Regulators of Cancer Immunotherapy Response PROJECT SUMMARY Despite enormous success in treating several types of cancer, immune checkpoint blocker (ICB) therapy still only shows efficacies in a subset of patients. Identifying novel regulators of immunotherapy response as well as improving the response rate of cancer immunotherapies remain open questions. Recently, we used CRISPR screens in mouse models to investigate T-cell infiltration, proliferation, and killing efficacy, and identified PBAF of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex as one novel regulator of T-cell mediated cytotoxicity. We also developed a computational model, TIDE, to identify gene signatures of CD8 T-cell dysfunction in immune hot tumors and T-cell exclusion in immune cold tumors. The resulting signatures, computed from tumor profiles in non-immunotherapy setting, show promising results in predicting melanoma and lung cancer patient response to immune checkpoint blockade based on pre-treatment tumor expression profiles. This proposed project aims to improve the TIDE biomarkers, identify novel regulators, and elucidate their mechanisms underlying ICB response. In Aim 1, we will develop machine learning approaches on large collection of clinical tumor transcriptome profiles from non-ICB settings to refine the TIDE predictive biomarker of ICB response, and develop a web server to comprehensively evaluate different ICB response biomarkers in all the available ICB cohorts. In Aim 2, we will conduct in vivo CRISPR screens in mouse syngeneic tumor models to identify cancer-cell intrinsic regulators of ICB response, which can serve as novel targets to improve ICB response. In Aim 3, we will elucidate the mechanism underlying two novel regulators of ICB response and characterize their effects on the tumor immune microenvironment using single-cell RNA-seq, single-cell ATAC- seq, and computational modeling. Our investigative team has combined expertise in computational methodology immunotherapy. immunology and big data mining, functional genomics profiling Our proposed studies, if successfully executed, and translational benefits to cancer immunotherapy. and screening, cancer immunology and could provide new insights into cancer PROJECT NARRATIVE Cancer immunotherapies have emerged over the last decade as highly promising approaches for cancer treatment, although only subsets of patients respond to immunotherapies. We propose to integrate computational modeling with functional genomics techniques to refine the immunotherapy response biomarkers, identify novel regulators of immunotherapy response, and elucidate their underlying mechanisms, with the potential to improve immunotherapy response.",Regulators of Cancer Immunotherapy Response,9930060,R01CA234018,"['Biological Response Modifiers ', ' Biomodulators

"Interdisciplinary Epidemiologic Consortium to Investigate T-cell Response in Colorectal Cancer PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The immune system has pivotal influence in the evolution and progression of many tumor types, including colorectal cancer (CRC). In particular, the presence of a strong T cell response in CRC, indicating activation of the adaptive immune system, has been associated with better patient outcomes. As such, recently developed immunotherapeutic approaches often attempt to harness the adaptive immune response. Immune cells are an integral component of the tumor microenvironment, and dynamically interact with neoplastic cells. However, our understanding as to the complexity of the T cell response and the factors that drive this response remains limited. The objective of this proposal is to identify genetic, lifestyle, and tumor factors associated with the T cell response in CRC, and to characterize the survival implications of that response. Specifically, in Aim 1 we will examine the relationship of personal characteristics with T cell response in CRC, including the role of (1a) germline genetic variation within human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) genes, and (1b) lifestyle factors (e.g., aspirin use, smoking, alcohol consumption). In Aim 2 we will focus on several colorectal tumor characteristics as they relate to T cell response, including (2a) the presence of Fusobacterium nucleatum and bacterial toxin genes in CRC, and (2b) somatic mutations in key signaling pathways (e.g., WNT signaling and RAS/RAF). In Aim 3, we will evaluate the associations of different aspects of T cell response with CRC survival, accounting for known prognostic factors and the relationships identified in Aims 1-2. To achieve these Aims, we propose to assess the density and spatial distribution of specific T cell subsets using multiplexed immunofluorescence (mIF) to quantify expression levels and co-expression patterns of CD3, CD4, CD8, CD45RO, and FOXP3 at the single cell level. This multiplexed assessment will allow us to examine the epidemiologic and prognostic relevance of numerous metrics of T cell response in CRC. This research will leverage the resources of the Genetics and Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer Consortium (GECCO) and the Colon Cancer Family Registry (CCFR). GECCO-CCFR is a large collaborative effort between observational studies of CRC. We have completed genome-wide germline genotyping and have harmonized epidemiologic data regarding a variety of lifestyle factors and personal characteristics for all participating studies. We are conducting DNA sequencing with a panel of 205 human genes and a small number of bacterial genes in CRC tumor tissue. Prospective follow-up for survival is ongoing, and we have harmonized existing survival data. Through this project, we will add information on T cell response in CRC for >2,500 CRC cases to the GECCO-CCFR resource. This project provides an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the epidemiology of the T cell response in CRC and the relationship of that response with personal and tumor characteristics. Insights gained through this novel study could ultimately inform the development and targeted implementation of emerging immunotherapeutic and immunopreventative strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE / RELEVANCE In this large, collaborative effort, we will examine how germline genetics, lifestyle factors, and tumor characteristics relate to the profile of T cells in colorectal cancers, and how those T cell profiles relate to cancer survival. The results of this work may ultimately inform strategies to harness the immune system for the prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer.",Interdisciplinary Epidemiologic Consortium to Investigate

"Integrating Radiomics into S0819 and Lung-MAP, Biomarker Driven Clinical Trials for Lung Cancer The goal of this research is to clinically translate software tools we developed through the Quantitative Imaging Network and validate their ability to assess the response of cancer in clinical trials. Current RECIST response criteria are inadequate to detect tumor changes in targeted molecular therapy and immunotherapies, two of the most promising avenues for drug discovery. We hypothesize that innovative volumetric and radiomics signatures of response and progression, identified using our quantitative CT imaging tools, can be integrated into clinical trial workflow to meet the urgent need for alternatives to RECIST criteria. Two large multi-site trials present a unique opportunity to test this hypothesis in one disease treated with multiple therapeutic options driven by tissue biomarkers. S0819 is a completed Phase III trial with 1300+ patients and Lung- MAP (S1400) is an ongoing first-of-its-kind Phase II/III model projected to enroll up to 5,000 patients using a multi-drug, targeted screening approach to match patients with sub-studies testing investigational treatments based on their unique tumor profiles. Aim 1 tests whether change in tumor volume over time, measured by our advanced volumetric segmentation algorithms, outperforms unidimensional RECIST 1.1 response criteria. Aim 2 correlates genomic mutations identified in S0819 and Lung-MAP with radiomics signatures constructed by our machine learning models, with the goal of developing a non-invasive, easily repeatable virtual biopsy through CT imaging. Aim 3 validates the prediction of clinical outcomes using early biomarkers of response and progression based on quantitative CT-based radiomic features, hypothesized to outperform both RECIST and volumetrics alone across therapeutic options including chemotherapies, targeted molecular agents, and immune checkpoint blockade. Our work has substantial health significance because validation of volume and radiomic changes as early biomarkers of response or progression will guide clinical trials for drug discovery and help match patients to personalized treatment. Response criteria developed through this study will be widely applicable to clinical practice because CT is the most common cancer imaging modality and the quantitative image analysis tools can easily be incorporated into existing popular imaging platforms and clinical workflow, reducing the time required by radiologists. Data from this project, including anonymized imaging data (CT for all patients and PET for a large subset), clinical meta- data, and lesion mark-ups by independent radiologists, will be shared for use by other researchers through the TCGA Cancer Imaging Archive, continuing an extensive history of data sharing by this team. This work will improve drug discovery for promising new classes of therapies by creating innovative response criteria based on volumetric and radiomics signatures developed with prior support by the QIN and now validated in two large multi-site clinical trials studying multiple therapeutic options in the most important histologic types of lung cancer and most commonly used imaging modality, CT. Results are expected to be applied to other tumor types and help match patients to the treatment that works best for them.","Integrating Radiomics into S0819 and Lung-MAP, Biomarker Driven Clinical

"Transforming family dogs into a powerful and accessible model for human cancer ABSTRACT There is an unmet need for novel approaches to cancer research, including improved model systems. Pet dogs are among the most promising natural models for translational cancer research​. They share our environment and develop cancers with clear clinical, histological, and genomic similarities to human cancer. We propose to use new genomic technology and a direct-to-dog-owner approach to overcome existing limitations of the canine model. To accomplish this, we will use new liquid biopsy technology, which makes it possible to sequence ​tumor exomes in circulating cell-free DNA from a blood sample, and thus achieve deeper understanding of tumor genomics without invasive biopsies. The power of these minimally invasive sampling technologies is greatest in application to very large sets of clinical samples. Family dogs, whose environments are shared with humans and for which tumor genomics are similar to human cancers, offer an unparalleled model in which to assemble clinical sets of size sufficient both to confirm the relevance of known genetic pathways, and to identify new ones. We propose to combine the power of cell-free DNA sequencing, ​the enthusiasm of citizen-scientist pet owners, and the clinical experience of veterinarians. We will create a research portal for collection of information on diagnosis, treatment, and outcome for thousands of dogs with cancer, as well as their environment and lifestyle. W​e will also develop new computational methodologies to identify genomic similarities between canine and human cancers. Comparison of these canine and human mutational profiles will enable matching of canine cancer subtypes with human cancer subtypes based on genetic pathways, facilitating canine trials to advance human clinical studies. We aim to:  Aim 1. ​Develop software to Identify canine models for human cancers using genomic data and  comprehensive, histology-blind analysis approach.  Aim 2. Develop and optimize ​cell-free DNA sampling and sequencing methods in dogs, including  ultra-low-pass whole genome sequencing and whole exome sequencing.  Aim 3. Implement a ​direct-to-dog-owner smartphone app to collect and validate detailed clinical, and  environmental data, paired with blood samples, for thousands of dogs. By combining the power of genome sequencing and new liquid biopsy technology with the opportunity to collect large sets of samples from a species whose cancers are genomically reflective of those in humans, our project​ will​ transform​ the scale and scope of translational cancer research and precision medicine. Project Narrative Pet dogs live in the same environments that we do, suggesting that profiling mutations in dog tumors could guide treatment of human cancers. With the help of veterinarians and citizen-scientist dog owners, we will build tools and resources needed to study cancer in thousands of dogs at once. This will help scientists find important genetic features of canine cancers, match them to specific human cancers, and translate what we learn into new cancer therapeutics.",Transforming family dogs into a powerful and accessible model for human cancer,9891974,R37CA218570,"['Biopsy ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Canis familiaris ', ' Canine Species ', ' Dogs ', ' Dogs Mammals ', ' canine ', ' domestic dog ', ' Environment ', ' Evolution ', ' Genes ', ' Gold ', ' Histology ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Institutes ', ' Learning ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Silicones ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' base ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Histologically ', ' Histologic ', ' Veterinarians ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' Oncology ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Catalogs ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Hereditary ', ' Inherited ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Medical center ', ' experience ', ' Gene Alteration ', ' Gene Mutation ', ' human data ', ' cohort ', ' Chemical Exposure ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Reporting ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' inherited factor ', ' genetic risk factor ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' Dog family ', ' genome sequencing ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' molecular profile ', ' molecular signature ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' Mutate ', ' Collection ', ' CCOP ', ' Community Oncology ', ' Community Clinical Oncology Program ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' oncogenomics ', ' cancer genomics ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' blind ', ' open source ', ' chemotherapy ', ' comparative ', ' tumor ', ' minimally invasive ', ' exomes ', ' exome ', ' comparative genomics ', ' exome-seq ', ' exome sequencing ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' precision medicine ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapy ', ' targeted treatment ', ' cell free circulating DNA ', ' cell free DNA ', ' amateur science ', ' amateur scientists ', ' citizen scientists ', ' civic science ', ' crowd science ', ' crowd-sourced science ', ' scientific citizenship ', ' citizen science ', ' prediction of response ', ' predictive response ', ' predictor of response ', ' response prediction ', ' predicting response ', ' genomic platform ', ' entire genome ', ' full genome ', ' whole genome ', ' cancer sub-types ', ' cancer subtypes ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' genomic data ', ' liquid biopsy ', ' translational cancer research ', ' DNA seq ', ' DNAseq ', ' DNA sequencing ', ' Android App ', ' Android Application ', ' Cell Phone Application ', ' Cell phone App ', ' Cellular Phone App ', ' Cellular Phone Application ', ' Smart Phone App ', ' Smart Phone Application ', ' Smartphone App ', ' iOS app ', ' iOS application ', ' iPhone App ', ' iPhone Application ', ' smartphone Application ', ' translational model ', ' model of human ', ' human model ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' supervised learning ', ' analysis pipeline ', ' classifier algorithm ', ' driver mutation ', ' ']",NCI,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R37,2020,653673,MA-02,0.04275733943404109
"Advanced preoperative assessment of meningiomas PROJECT SUMMARY Meningiomas, which arise from arachnoid cells, make up >1/3 of all intracranial tumors. While typically benign, these tumors induce clinical symptoms due to mass effect and peritumoral edema. In cases requiring intervention, gross total resection provides the best outcomes when possible. However, treatment strategy is ultimately decided by determining the proper balance between surgical difficulty and the patient's overall health. Two mechanical properties are important predictors of surgical difficulty: tumor stiffness and adherence to surrounding tissues. Knowledge of these properties before surgery would allow clinicians to more accurately assess surgical risk and identify the most effective treatment strategy. Mechanical properties are difficult to predict by conventional imaging approaches, but can be directly assessed by Magnetic Resonance Elastography (MRE) and related Slip Interface Imaging (SII). In published studies, we have shown that MRE-based stiffness estimates are significantly correlated with tumor stiffness in meningiomas and pituitary adenomas. Furthermore, SII accurately predicted tumor adherence in meningiomas and vestibular schwannomas. Still, challenges remain to make these findings clinically-impactful. For estimating stiffness, the primary limitation lies in resolution. Therefore, in Aim 1 we will develop a voxel- wise classifier of tumor stiffness. This aim will build on our recently published neural network-based inversion (NNI), which has demonstrated superior performance to conventional direct inversions in simulation and in the brain. In Aim 1a, we will advance NNI by implementing more complex neural network architectures and creating more realistic simulations for training. In Aim 1b, the advances will be validated in a phantom with inhomogeneous stiffness. Finally, in Aim 1c with the aid of our Neurosurgery collaborators, we will collect a large sample of surgical stiffness assessments. We will use these assessments to train a voxel-wise stiffness classifier, which will then be validated in a separate test set. This aim will result in a map that conveys both stiffness and confidence in the prediction on a scale that is clinically meaningful to surgeons. The most-pressing limitations in SII include the subjective interpretation of the images and the lack of spatially resolved predictions. Aim 2 will address these challenges by developing a voxel-wise slip interface classifier. In Aim 2a, we will investigate a neural network-based predictor of slip interfaces to add to our current methods. In Aim 2b, we will evaluate if this new method can improve predictions in phantom experiments. In Aim 2c, we will again leverage surgical assessments of meningioma adherence to train and test a voxel-wise classifier. The result of this aim will be a map of tumor adherence represented as an easily interpreted probability. Taken together, these aims will provide neurosurgeons with clinically-important information to improve patient management. More broadly, technical advances made in this project will impact the entire MRE field. PROJECT NARRATIVE Meningiomas are the most common type of intracranial tumor and are best treated by total resection when possible. The mechanical properties of these tumors are important factors in surgical difficulty, where soft, non- adherent tumors are more easily removed that firm or adherent tumors.

While the TCGA data has implicated numerous molecular aberrations in cancer etiology and mechanisms, a direct link between genomic events and patient outcomes is lacking. While the TNM (tumor, node, metastasis) staging system is widely utilized and provides prognostic information, CCs show considerable stage-independent variability in outcome indicating that more robust classifiers are needed for prognostic stratification. Prognostic information is critical to guide patient management and surveillance after cancer resection and can inform treatment selection. Using only gene expression data, we identified four consensus molecular subtypes (CMS) of CC with distinct prognoses. We hypothesize that inclusion of additional genomic features will enable more granular molecular subtyping by identifying additional molecular patterns. Toward this objective (Aim 1), we will utilize multi-omics data sets generated from two completed phase III adjuvant chemotherapy trials in CC (NCCTG N0147, NSAPB C-08). We will also develop a supervised prognostic model by integrating comprehensive molecular data with clinicopathological variables and outcome data (Aim 2). Our unique resource for supervised learning is the high-quality survival data from the clinical trial cohorts. We hypothesize that integration of genomic alterations within clinically relevant genes and gene expression levels with clinicopathological variables can improve the prediction of recurrence/survival compared to traditional TNM staging alone. We will include in a step-wise fashion in our training models selected genes and miRNA expression, somatic mutations, minor allele frequencies, somatic copy number alterations as well as CMS and clinical features, to optimize predictive performance. Given that immune and stromal infiltrating cells are well recognized as determinants of prognosis in CC, we propose to characterize tumor immune and stromal markers among distinct CC molecular subtypes and determine their contribution to prognosis (Aim 3). Specifically, we will characterize these transcriptomic markers computationally, and determine whether they can refine molecular subtypes and improve prognostic modeling. Our proposal represents the first comprehensive prediction of CC patient survival using features from both genomic and transcriptomic alterations that will be integrated with immune and stromal markers using state-of-the-art supervised learning approaches. The impact of this work is substantial in that it will identify determinants of recurrence at the molecular pathway level or in the tumor microenvironment, which will help prioritize targets for therapeutic intervention. Furthermore, the outcome of this grant is expected to have practice-changing implications that can further advance the field of precision oncology. PROJECT NARRATIVE The survival of colon cancer patients varies considerably within the same tumor stage indicating the need for better predictors of outcome. We will use tumor molecular profiling data from clinical trial cohorts to identify subgroups of patients that show differences in outcome and then develop a model that includes both molecular and clinical data to predict survival. This information is critical for determining patient treatment and follow-up approaches that may be practice-changing.",Integration of Genomic and Clinical Data to Enhance Subtyping of Colon

"Pathogenesis of the cART unresponsive Kaposi’s sarcoma tumor niche Abstract Kaposi's Sarcoma (KS) is the most common AIDS-defining cancer. Combined anti-retroviral therapy (cART) has greatly reduced KS-associated mortality among AIDS patients; however, a serous clinical problem exists in that up to 50% of HIV+KS+ patients in the United States and 61% in Sub-Saharan Africa never achieve complete remission even with chemotherapy and a reduction in HIV viral loads. No definitive study has identified if there are tumor-associated features or mechanisms are associated with cART-progressive KS (progressors) vs. the responder (responders) phenotype. Our study utilizes a robust pre-cART KS tissue collection (n = 224) from the ACSR that originated from the Antiretrovirals for Kaposi's Sarcoma (ARKS) clinical trial. 36% of ARKS participants experienced continued progression of KS despite a reduction in viral loads and restored T-cell counts, in contrast to the rest of the cohort who experienced a reduction or elimination of tumors by the 1-year trial endpoint. This application poses several hypotheses concerning the progressor phenotype: 1) prior to the initiation of cART, an increase in HIV and/or KSHV-infected immune cells enhances a stimulatory immunological profile in the progressor phenotype, 2) there are significant differences in the upregulation of KSHV lytic and immunomodulation genes, which stimulate increased immune cell recruitment into the pre-cART tumor microenvironment and promote tumor progression through cytokine-signaling inflammatory processes enhanced in part by the cART-revitalized immune system, 3) the highly inflammatory nature of KS tumors, comprising a complex mixture of immune cells with which to interact, selects for unique and/or elusive HIV genotypes, distinct from plasma HIV, that promote stimulatory processes to continue in the progressor phenotype. Our Specific Aims address these hypotheses using a combination of advanced immunohistochemistry, virus specific cellular localization (DNA and RNAscope), high-throughput gene expression analysis (RNAseq), and a novel deep sequencing approach applied to HIV. Innovations include the unprecedented amount pre-cART KS tumor material available for the study, advanced imagining technologies, in vivo KS tumors gene expression studies, the use of the newer PacBio SMRT sequencing approach applied to HIV, and machine-learning approaches that can define non-linear associations in complex data sets. This project will define the largest well-characterized set of combinatorial features related to cART-associated KS outcomes derived directly from KS-associated biomaterial. Identifying clinically relevant immune factors in the tumor niche pre-cART will pave the way for the development of future mechanistic studies on the functions of both viral and cellular genes that are involved in cART resistant tumor progression. Project Narrative Combined anti-retroviral therapy (cART) successfully reduces the risk of progressive Kaposi's sarcoma in the majority of HIV infected people; however, up to 50% of those treated will never retrieve remission, even when viral loads are reduced and the immune system is restored. In this project we will to determine the pre-cART tumor features that identify the progressor phenotype. With the ability to differentiate between the progressor and responder outcome categories, a simple biopsy prior to cART could elucidate a better combinatorial treatment approach.",Pathogenesis of the

"Single-cell characterization of tumor and microenvironment co-evolution in Peripheral T-cell Lymphomas Project Summary Tumor and microenvironment constitute complex ecologies involving a multitude of stromal cells, immune cells, and in some cases coexisting microbes. A paradigmatic example of complex tumor-microenvironment interactions are peripheral T-cell lymphomas, aggressive and genetically complex tumors where tumor cells often constitute a minority cell population. Peripheral T-cell lymphomas are frequently associated with the presence of Epstein-Barr virus whose role in the disease remains largely uncharacterized. We have shown that the presence of specific macrophage populations and viral transcriptional programs are associated to survival. But, how do tumor and microenvironment coevolve and inform prognosis? Our project goal is to characterize the tumor- microenvironment interactions and coevolution in peripheral T-cell lymphomas using large collections of human transcriptomic data and longitudinal single-cell sequencing data from recently developed mouse models. We will develop an approach based on random matrix theory and topological data analysis for modelling the continuous aspect of tumor microenvironment evolution. We will further deploy our lab-developed methodology for in silico pathogen detection to study the interactions between the Epstein-Barr virus and peripheral T-cell lymphoma lymphomagenesis and progression. Successful completion of our goals will provide a general, experimentally validated strategy to uncover the dynamical nature of tumor-microenvironment interactions at the single-cell resolution in tumor types with complex stromal component. Additionally, our approach will help uncover new microenvironment driven targets supporting lymphoma cell growth, with potential therapeutic implications for the treatment of this deadly disease.

"Automatic Volumetric Treatment Response Assessment and Determination of Regional Genetic Characteristics in Glioblastoma Project Summary Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary adult brain tumor with an incidence rate of 3.2 per 100,000 people. Due to its heterogeneous genetic characteristics, GBM carries a dismal prognosis, with a median survival of only 14 months and five-year survival rates are less than 10%. The current standard of care is maximal safe surgical resection, chemoradiation, and adjuvant temozolomide. Within the natural history of GBM, there are adaptive genetic changes within the tumor that lead to treatment resistance and inevitable recurrence, leading to patient death. While a variety of treatments can be administered for tumor recurrence, there is currently no consensus on therapy for recurrent tumor as none have been proven to provide substantial survival benefit. The major limitation of the current treatment strategy is that clinicians do not have a reliable method of longitudinally assessing tumor volumes and regional genetic characteristics of the tumor during the course of treatment. Rather, clinical decision-making is based on a manual and variable two- dimensional measure of tumor burden, a surrogate of tumor volume, and genetic characterization of select molecular markers at the time of initial surgery. A tool that can automatically assess tumor volumes and regional genetic characteristics longitudinally will substantially improve evaluation of treatment efficacy, allowing for an earlier switch to alternative treatment strategies and thus, more personalized tailoring of patient care. Thus, a critical need exists for automatic methods that non-invasively evaluate treatment efficacy on a patient-to-patient basis. To address this problem, we will develop a novel solution based on deep learning that leverages structural, diffusion, and perfusion information from multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging. At the core of our solution is a convolutional neural network; a machine learning technique that can be trained on raw image data to predict clinical outputs of interest. Firstly, we will develop a fully automatic technique for longitudinal tracking of tumor volumes. To do this, we will develop novel deep learning architectures through incorporation of state-of-the-art neural network components that can segment both whole tumor and tumor subregions (edema, non-enhancing tumor, and gadolinium contrast-enhancing tumor). To prove algorithm utility, we will automatically derive tumor volumes in a longitudinal patient cohort and correlate volumes with clinical outcomes. Secondly, we will develop a non-invasive, deep learning algorithm for evaluation of regional genetic characteristics of GBM. To train this algorithm, we will acquire imaging-localized surgical biopsies and genetic profiling of GBM patients undergoing surgery. Once trained, the algorithm can be used to non- invasively identify clonal populations and track genetic changes associated with clinical outcomes during the course of treatment. The development of these deep learning algorithms will transform physician’s capacity for clinical decision-making and dramatically improve outcomes for a devastating disease. Project Narrative The proposed research will provide automatic deep-learning tools to aid clinical decision-making for glioblastoma, the most common primary adult brain tumor that carries a dismal prognosis. The major limitation of the current treatment strategy is that clinicians do not have a reliable method of longitudinally assessing tumor volumes and regional genetic characteristics of the tumor during the course of treatment.

"Integrative framework for identifying dysregulated mechanisms in the tumor-immune microenvironment Project Summary/Abstract Current cancer therapies provide targeted treatments attacking specific cells, however, tumor cells are heterogeneous and evolving. To develop personalized treatments, we need to understand the composition of cell types in the tumor and the disrupted regulatory mechanisms that lead to cancer stem cells (CSCs). CSCs are resistant to standard therapies and have the ability to form new tumors leading to relapse and metastasis. Immunotherapies harnessing the immune system can be particularly successful in targeting CSCs, however, their mechanisms of action are not well understood. I hypothesize that an unbiased study of the complex tumor microenvironment containing elusive resistant CSCs and interacting immune populations can be achieved with high-dimensional genome-wide data, such as state-of-the-art single-cell resolution transcriptional integrated with epigenetic measurements, using Bayesian statistical tools that are ideal for distinguishing technical noise from biological heterogeneity and integrating different data types. I capitalize on our previous work in collaboration with the Alexander Rudensky Lab on characterizing immune cell populations in breast cancer tumors, using a computational method we developed in the Dana Pe’er Lab for clustering cells in single-cell transcriptomic data while simultaneously normalizing cells and correcting batch effects. In my PhD work, I showed the power of incorporating epigenetic data in inferring regulatory programs. Hence, in my K99 mentored phase, I aim to develop a computational framework for integrating epigenetic data with single-cell transcriptomic data to infer leukemic stem cells and dysregulated mechanisms in Acute Myeloid Leukemia in collaboration with Ross Levine (Aim 1). I have chosen AML as it involves enrichment of epigenetic mutations and the normal hematopoiesis system is well-characterized and would serve as a reference. As an independent investigator in the R00 phase, I will extend this framework to infer CSCs and dysregulations in the tumor as well as composition of immune cells and their reprogramming in under-characterized solid tumors, in collaboration with Benjamin Neel and others in my future institute (Aim 2). I then aim to use this toolbox to study the impact of immunotherapy treatments on the tumor-immune microenvironment in collaboration with Catherine Wu and my future institute (Aim 3). We expect that our results lead to insights into regulatory mechanisms that are disrupted in cancer and drive heterogeneous populations. We would also infer mechanisms of action of immunotherapies in the tumor-immune microenvironment. This proposal describes a training plan to advance my career to an independent investigator at the interface of machine learning and cancer biology. During the K99 phase, I will be supported by an outstanding and interdisciplinary team of advisors and collaborators with expertise in all aspects of the proposed research. Together with institutional support from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and formal coursework and training, I will bridge my knowledge gap in cancer biology and gain the communication and leadership skills vital for my transition. Project Narrative  Cancer treatments lead to favorable outcomes only in a subset of patients due to significant heterogeneity in tumor cells. To develop treatments tailored to each patient and the composition of cell types in each tumor, we need to characterize the complex populations of tumor cells and their dysregulated mechanisms. I propose that an unbiased characterization can be achieved with an interdisciplinary framework of single-cell resolution transcriptional and epigenetic measurements, that are integrated with principled computational tools.",Integrative framework for identifying dysregulated mechanisms in the tumor-immune microenvironment,10102369,R00CA230195,"['Mammalian Oviducts ', ' Fallopian Tubes ', '

"Engineering personalized micro-tumor ecosystems Abstract Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in the United States, accounting for near 1 in every 4 deaths. However, despite the recent development of subtype-specific personalized therapy based on achievements in the fields of molecular and genetic profiling, many cancer treatments still have low efficacy which mostly arise from the limited ability to predict the patient tumor responses to therapeutic agents. The major reason that current therapeutics often cannot translate into a successful clinical outcomes is because of the complex tumor microenvironment and heterogeneity that limit the predictive power of the biomarker-guided strategies for chemotherapy. Therefore, the successful engineering of personalized three-dimensional (3D) tumor ecosystem that can recapitulate the tumor microenvironment and heterogeneity in vitro is strongly desired to accurately predict patients’ responses to anti-cancer drugs and thus further improve patient outcome. Here we propose to develop a personalized breast-cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip platform for personalized screening of cancer chemotherapeutics with high accuracy by utilizing patient-derived tumor explant, defined tumor grade-matched biomaterial matrices and autologous patient serum to mimic patient-specific tumor hallmarks. The proposed cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip will also be tightly regulated under physiological fluid dynamics. In this project, we have hypothesized that 1) the use of tumor explant will embrace the critical components of the tumor heterogeneity of the patient, 2) the combination of defined tumor grade-matched matrix, autologous patient serum, and a microfluidic bioreactor will prevent the phenotype alteration of the tumor explant, and 3) the integration of a machine-learning algorithm with the cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip platform will provide more accurate, unbiased prediction of the patient responses to chemotherapeutics based on the data gathered from the engineered tumor model. Our preliminary results show that the combination of tumor explant culture and tumor-derived matrix constituents had predicted therapeutic responses with 100% sensitivity. Our preliminary results show high specificity throughout a range of cancers including breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and thus the findings can have broad applications, and can emerge as a paradigm shift in the management of cancer. Narrative Despite the recent development of subtype-specific personalized therapy based on achievements in the fields of molecular and genetic profiling, the cancer treatment still has low efficacy that mostly arise from the limited ability of existing models to recapitulate the tumor heterogeneity and therefore predict the patient tumor responses to therapeutic agents.

"Regulation of Cellular Proliferation by Novel Mitochondrial-Encoded Tumor Suppressors ABSTRACT Cellular compartments are coordinated through a dynamic bidirectional communication network amongst various organelles. Here, we focus on the communication between mitochondria and the nucleus, organelles that each possess their own genomes. The mitochondrial and nuclear genomes have co-evolved for over a billion years and have likely required close communication and cross-regulation. However, whereas mitochondria are known to be regulated by over 1,000 nuclear-encoded proteins, but there is currently no known mitochondrial-encoded factor that actively communicates to and regulates the nucleus. We have recently identified a novel gene encoded within the mitochondrial DNA and named it MOTS-c (Mitochondrial ORF within the Twelve S rRNA type-c). MOTS-c is a small 16 amino acid peptide that regulates metabolic homeostasis, in part, via the master nutrient sensor AMPK (adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase). We recently reported that MOTS-c can translocate into the nucleus in response to metabolic stress to bind to chromatin and regulate nuclear gene expression. Further, our preliminary study using a multi-pronged approach, including single cell RNA-seq, bioinformatics (including machine learning), chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) coupled with quantitative PCR (qPCR), and cell sorting, showed that MOTS-c can regulate cellular proliferation; MOTS-c targeted the p53/p21 pathway and ribosomal processes. Considering the important metabolic role of mitochondria in cellular proliferation processes (29), a critical question that remains largely enigmatic is how mitochondrial-encoded factors communicate to the nucleus to coordinate the metabolic shift with gene expression during proliferation. Notably, rapidly dividing cancer cells had undetectable levels of MOTS-c or nuclear-translocation deficiency, suggesting loss of mito-nuclear communication by MOTS-c. Together, cancer may be a genetic disease in which our two genomes exist in a state of disrupted bi-directional communication/regulation, and may serve as a unique model to start understanding the role of MOTS-c in cellular proliferation. Because MOTS-c expression/function was dysregulated and that MOTS-c can negatively regulate cell cycle/proliferation, we hypothesize that MOTS-c is a mitochondrial-encoded tumor suppressor, the first of its kind to be identified, that directly regulates the nucleus to coordinate cellular metabolism with proliferation. We propose three aims to test this hypothesis. First, we will characterize MOTS-c as a tumor suppressor that regulates cell proliferation at the molecular, cellular, genetic level. Second, we will comprehensively map the MOTS-c-dependent functional nuclear genomic landscape using multiple complimentary genomics approach, including single cell RNA-seq, ATAC-seq (chromatin accessibility), and genomic footprinting using ChIP-seq. The data from each genomic approach will be integrated using cutting-edge computational methods, including machine learning, to decipher the message(s) MOTS- c delivers to the nuclear genome to regulate cancer cell proliferation and survival. Lastly, we will determine how MOTS- c-mediated communication to the nucleus can differentially regulate cellular proliferation and stress resistance in normal and malignant cells using mouse models of cancer. If successful, we predict that our study will have broad and lasting impact on (i) basic research by introducing the paradigm-shifting concept of mitochondrial-encoded tumor suppressors that coordinate cellular metabolism and proliferation and (ii) therapeutic development by revealing mtDNA as a source of novel drug targets (currently there are no FDA-approved drugs based on the mitochondrial genome). PROJECT NARRATIVE Key cellular functions, such as proliferation, require the coordination of the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes through dynamic bi-directional communication. However, whereas mitochondria are known to be regulated by many nuclear-encoded proteins, the nucleus has traditionally been not considered to be actively regulated by mitochondrial-encoded factors. We propose to study how a novel tumor suppressor peptide encoded in the mitochondrial genome that we identified directly regulates the nuclear genome to coordinate cellular metabolism and proliferation.",Regulation of Cellular Proliferation by Novel Mitochondrial-Encoded Tumor Suppressors,9944175,R01GM136837,"['Adenosine Monophosphate ', "" 5'-Adenylic acid "", ' Adenylic Acid ', ' Affect ', ' Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' Bacteria ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cell Cycle ', ' Cell Division Cycle ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cell Separation ', ' Cell Isolation ', ' Cell Segregation ', ' Cell Separation Technology ', ' cell sorting ', ' Cell Survival ', ' Cell Viability ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chromatin ', ' Communication ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Mitochondrial DNA ', ' mtDNA ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Electron Transport ', ' electron transfer ', ' Endothelium ', ' Eukaryotic Cell ', ' Evolution ', ' Exhibits ', ' Foundations ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Homeostasis ', ' Autoregulation ', ' Physiological Homeostasis ', ' In Vitro ', ' Insulin Resistance ', ' insulin resistant ', ' Language ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Maps ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Mitochondria ', ' mitochondrial ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Names ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulentia ', ' obese ', ' obese people ', ' obese person ', ' obese population ', ' Organelles ', ' Osteoporosis ', ' Patients ', ' Peptides ', ' Protein Kinase ', ' ATP-protein phosphotransferase ', ' Kinase Family Gene ', ' glycogen synthase a kinase ', ' hydroxyalkyl protein kinase ', ' phosphorylase b kinase kinase ', ' Proteins ', ' Publishing ', ' Ribosomes ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' Ribosomal RNA ', ' rRNA ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' TP53 gene ', ' P53 ', ' TP53 ', ' TRP53 ', ' Tumor Protein p53 Gene ', ' p53 Genes ', ' Site-Directed Mutagenesis ', ' Site-Specific Mutagenesis ', ' Targeted DNA Modification ', ' Targeted Modification ', ' Open Reading Frames ', ' ORFs ', ' Protein Coding Region ', ' Molecular Genetics ', ' Mediating ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Malignant ', ' Malignant -

"Quantifying Multiscale Competitive Landscapes of Clonal Diversity in Glioblastoma ABSTRACT  Glioblastoma (GBM) exhibits profound intratumoral molecular heterogeneity that contributes to treatment resistance and poor survival. Specifically, each tumor comprises multiple molecularly-distinct subpopulations with different treatment sensitivities. This heterogeneity not only portends the pre-existence of resistant molecular subpopulations, but also the communications between neighboring subpopulations that further modulate tumorigenicity and resistance. In fact, a minority tumor subpopulation with EGFRvIII mutation has been shown to potentiate a majority subpopulation with wild-type EGFR to increase tumor growth, cell survival, and drug resistance. This type of cooperativity presents clear implications for improving GBM treatment. Yet compared to other tumor types, the interactions in GBM remain critically understudied. A significant barrier to studying the interactions between molecularly-distinct subpopulations is the challenge of tissue sampling in GBM. In particular, contrast-enhanced MRI (CE-MRI) routinely guides surgical biopsy and resection of the MRI enhancing core, but fails to address the diverse subpopulations of the surrounding non-enhancing parenchyma (so called “brain around tumor” or BAT). These unresected residual subpopulations in BAT represent the main contributors to tumor recurrence, which can exhibit different therapeutic targets (and interactions) compared with enhancing biopsies. To address the limitations of tissue sampling, imaging techniques can help quantitatively characterize tumors in their entirety, including unresected BAT regions. Our group has used multi-parametric MRI and image-guided biopsies to develop and validate machine-learning (ML) models of intratumoral genomic heterogeneity, with particular focus on the BAT zone. In Aim 1, will we collect and molecularly profile a large set of image-recorded stereotactic biopsies in primary GBM patients to quantify the diversity of molecularly-distinct subpopulations, as well as their phenotypic niches, throughout the BAT zone. We will assess local heterogeneity at the biopsy level and also co-localize regional patterns and rates of recurrence on serial MRI. In Aim 2, we will use these biopsies and spatially matched MRI metrics to refine our existing ML predictive models. We will use these ML models to co- localize spatial patterns of molecularly-distinct subpopulations (and their phenotypic niches) to quantify their risk of regional recurrence. In Aim 3, we will functionally validate the subpopulation interactions observed in Aims 1 and 2 using patient derived xenograft (PDX) models. We will also validate these interactions in human GBM using a subset of spatially matched biopsies from primary and recurrent tumors in the same patients. This proposal leverages our unique expertise in image-guided tissue analysis and MRI-based computational modeling to study the diversity of molecularly-distinct subpopulations and the evolving competitive landscapes in human GBM. This work will help risk stratify patients in future targeted clinical drug trials and should also facilitate new strategies (e.g., adaptive therapy) to exploit subpopulation co-dependency for therapeutic benefit. PROJECT NARRATIVE  We propose here a novel strategy that identifies the potential molecular underpinnings of treatment resistance within the zone where tumor almost always recurs. By developing image-based models that quantify the diversity of molecularly-distinct subpopulations (and their interactions) within individual tumors, the proposed work will improve image-based diagnosis and therapeutic strategies in the paradigm of individualized oncology.",Quantifying Multiscale Competitive Landscapes of Clonal Diversity in Glioblastoma,10005896,U01CA220378,"['Biopsy ', '

These Synthetic Tools to Annotate Reporter Organoids for Cancer Heterogeneity and Recurrence Development (StarOrchard) include: Synthetic Promoter Activated Recombination of Kaleidoscopic Organoids (SPARKO), Combinatorial Genetics En Masse (CombiGEM), and single-cell RNA sequencing panorama (Scanorama). SPARKO can annotate heterogeneous cancer populations in living cells via fluorescent protein expression libraries to make multi- colored tumor organoids. CombiGEM can rapidly identify potential therapeutic targets via large-scale, massively parallel, and unbiased combinatorial genetic screens. Scanorama can integrate the analysis of large datasets of single-cell transcriptomics via sophisticated bioinformatics algorithms. These tools focus on barcoding strategies to enable accurate tracking and analysis of individual tumor cells that harbor distinct genetic aberrations, and substantially expand the utility of the Next Generation Cancer Models (NGCMs) for cancer mechanistic investigations or therapeutic discovery. The StarOrchard tools enable targeted genetic perturbations in annotated heterogeneous tumor phenotypes without destroying cells for sequencing. These tools will be applied to a large number and variety of NGCMs to optimize experimental protocol. To ensure success, we have convened an outstanding team: PI Timothy K. Lu, MD, PhD, has made strikingly original contributions to Synthetic Biology tools that enable high-throughput genetic interrogation of cancer cell drug dependency; PI Ömer Yilmaz, MD, PhD, has extensive expertise in cancers of the gastrointestinal tract and has developed novel technologies to maintain patient-derived colon cancer organoids for in vivo modeling; and PI Bonnie Berger, PhD, will use her expertise in bioinformatics and her Scanorama algorithm to integrate data across all tumor types based on dynamic single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq). We are also supported by leading experts in cancer biology and various cancer types at both the basic science and clinical oncology frontiers of cancer research. The collective commitment and multidisciplinary contributions of the entire team ensure the establishment of an openly distributed investigative tool set that accelerates advancements in cancer biology and therapeutic discovery PROJECT NARRATIVE  We propose to develop a collection of Synthetic Tools to Annotate Reporter Organoids for Cancer Heterogeneity and Recurrence Development (StarOrchard) to enable wide adoption of the Next Generation Cancer Models in the cancer research community.

"Proteogenomic Data Analysis for Cancer Systems Biology and Clinical Translation PROJECT SUMMARY It has become feasible to generate deep quantitative data for many of the molecules that are functional in cells, making it possible to survey a large number of tumors measuring genomic alterations and changes to transcripts, proteins and metabolites. It is, however, not clear what is the best way to integrate these data sets to extract as much information as possible about the biology that drives the cancer and how to best disrupt the tumor growth. Our proposed Proteogenomic Data Analysis Center for Cancer Systems Biology and Clinical Translation will develop new methods for better analyzing and integrating these data sets. In addition to developing statistical and machine learning methods, we also emphasize visual exploration of the data, and we will implement interactive web browser based visualization that will allow researchers to easily explore these vast data sets and gain novel insights by being able to quickly switch between summary information and details of the raw data. PROJECT NARRATIVE The mission of the proposed data analysis center is to leverage high dimensional large-scale data from tumor samples to identify new avenues for the development of clinical prognostics and therapeutics for cancer.

"Dissecting Therapeutic Resistance and Progression in Metastatic Melanoma Through Clinical Computational Oncology Project Summary  The development of targeted therapy (BRAF/MEKi) and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) targeting the co-inhibitory receptors CTLA-4 and PD-1 have revolutionized the treatment of metastatic melanoma. However, only a subset of patients maintain durable responses, and many people experience substantial side effects of therapy. Predicting therapeutic response in individual patients remains a critical and unresolved issue. Furthermore, the series of key genomic and epigenetic events driving progression and resistance to therapy is incompletely understood. The guiding hypothesis of this proposal is that (a) resistance to ICB and targeted therapy is mediated by tumor intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms, some of which may be elucidated by systematic multi-modal molecular characterization of the tumor and tumor microenvironment; and (b) applying modern machine-learning and statistical approaches to molecular and clinical data from patient tumors will inform development of new therapeutic approaches and predictive models to improve patient care.  Identifying and validating predictors of intrinsic resistance to BRAF/MEKi and ICB across large human cohorts has been limited to date. Aim 1 of this proposal applies genomic and transcriptomic characterization of pre-treatment tumors to large cohorts of patients treated with BRAF/MEKi, PD-1i, and CTLA-4i in order to discover and to validate molecular and clinical markers of response and resistance. Machine learning approaches will integrate these markers into parsimonious models predicting response. A differential analysis using mutual information will be conducted to reveal markers that predict differential response to therapy.  A significant proportion of patients do not respond or maintained sustained responses to immunotherapy, and there is a critical need to characterize the acquisition or selection of drivers that confer resistance to immunotherapy. Aim 2 of this proposal develops algorithms using molecular characterization of longitudinally collected tumor samples across multiple anatomic sites to discover genomic and epigenetic drivers of progression and resistance to immunotherapy using phylogenetic analysis as the backbone of discovery.  Finally, the ability to detect novel tumor driver mutations present at low frequencies is strongly dependent on cohort size. Aim 3 of this proposal leverages all genomically characterized melanomas to perform a meta- analysis using state-of-the-art and novel algorithms to discover novel driver mutations present at low frequencies with a focus on tumor subsets that lack known targetable drivers.  These studies will expand the actionable landscape of genomic and epigenetic alterations in metastatic melanoma, advance our understanding of intrinsic and acquired resistance to targeted and immunotherapies in melanoma, and establish a framework to predict response in individual patients, which may impact patient care in melanoma and have applicability in other disease settings. Project Narrative  New targeted and immunotherapies have revolutionized the treatment and extended the prognosis of metastatic melanoma, but only a subset of patients have durable responses, and our ability to predict who will benefit from which treatment is limited. Further, the specific alterations driving tumor progression and resistance to therapy are not well characterized, but may inform the development of new therapeutic targets and combination therapies. This proposal aims to integrate molecular data from patient tumor samples and their clinical context to predict response to targeted and immunotherapies, and dissect the drivers of progression and resistance to therapy in individual patients.",Dissecting Therapeutic Resistance and Progression in Metastatic Melanoma Through Clinical Computational Oncology,9997854,K08CA234458,"['Algorithms ', '

"Automated imaging analysis tools to guide clinical decision making in brain tumor patients Project Summary  Glioblastoma (GBM) is a common and aggressive form of brain cancer affecting up to 20,000 new patients in the US every year. Standard of care therapies include stereotactic surgical resection, radiation therapy, and adjuvant chemotherapy. After initial treatment, patient monitoring is guided by standard MR imaging performed at routine intervals. Despite these rigorous therapies, current median survival is only 15 months. Imaging is a central part of brain tumor management, but MRI findings in brain tumor patients can be challenging to interpret and is further confounded by interpretation variability. Accurate interpretation of imaging is particularly important during the post-treatment phase of patient care as it can help clinicians proactively manage disease through early, precise characterization of true tumor recurrence. Disease-specific structured reporting systems attempt to reduce variability in imaging results by implementing well-defined imaging criteria and standardized language. The Brain Tumor Reporting and Data System (BT-RADS), developed at Emory University, is one such framework streamlined for clinical workflows and includes quantitative criteria for more objective evaluation of follow-up imaging. While BT-RADS has had success with clinical adoptability, it still faces hurdles reducing interobserver variability and improving objective classification of disease state.  This proposed study addresses an unmet need for unbiased, quantitative metrics for robust, objective interpretation of follow-up imaging for GBM patients. Where previous evaluative methods used two-dimensional, representative MRI slices for evaluating the extent of tumor, we propose to develop a deep learning segmentation tool, accurately calculating volumes of tumor after surgical resection, and trained from our expansive database of patient data with contours manually drawn by radiation oncologists. Further, we propose to develop computationally advanced software for predicting disease progression building upon the clinically developed BT- RADS criteria. Such tools would assist physicians in caring for brain tumor patients through post-treatment surveillance and guide future clinical decision making. In addition, we believe these quantitative metrics would have unbounded potential in clinical trial settings where it may be difficult to evaluate the efficacy of novel therapeutics for GBM. Therefore, these assistive tools will be tested on clinical trial data to determine if they are superior to conventional measurements alone.  A fundamental goal of this proposal is ensuring the quantitative tools we develop are applicable for clinicians in their daily lives. Therefore, an effort will be made to collaborate extensively with clinicians to house the algorithms in sleek, intuitive software for physicians to utilize. Through the multidisciplinary environment, high performance computing, and clinical resources we have available, we believe this proposal will be successful in developing clinically assistive tools for unbiased, objective monitoring of GBM patients in clinical settings and evaluation of novel therapies in research settings. Project Narrative  Follow-up imaging for glioblastoma patients is challenging to interpret due to subjectivity in evaluating disease state and overlap between treatment effects and tumor progression. More objective follow-up criteria are vital for sensitive and accurate monitoring of glioblastoma patients after initial treatment to ensure proactive management of disease and accurate characterization of tumor recurrence. This research proposal will develop user-friendly quantitative software for lesion segmentation and disease-state assessment, providing unbiased metrics for post-treatment patient monitoring and guidance of management decisions in clinical and research settings.",Automated imaging analysis tools to guide clinical decision making in brain tumor patients,9911574,F31CA247564,"['Adoption ', '

"Human Tumor Atlas Network: Data Coordinating Center Supplement This proposal is a collaboration with the HTAN Data Coordination Center DCC and describes an Image Data Project aimed at developing and deploying the technology needed for storage, distribution and basic analysis of cell and tissue images collected by multiple HTAN Centers. Multiplexed tissue images are an important type of data for nearly all of the centers contributing to the HTAN (second only to single cell sequencing data in number of centers collecting data). However, the software needed to visualize, analyze, manage, and share multiplexed images of tissues and tumors is underdeveloped. The initial availability of SARDANA images has highlighted the challenges faced by HTAN, including the DCC, in deploying an infrastructure for distributing large and complex images. We therefore propose a two-year HTAN Image Data Project (IDP) led by the DCC and HMS PCA focused on the rapid development and deployment of image informatic systems and computational resources for image management and analysis. Our goal is to put in place a functional first-generation system no later than summer 2020 and to then steadily refine the system so that it becomes the backbone of cross-functional HTAN atlases. As a matter of necessity, we will start with informatic systems and software that are either available today or in a relatively advanced state of development. However, we expect to evaluate these choices throughout the IDP and change course as necessary to incorporate potentially superior approaches. We will also support the diverse needs and formats of centers using different data collection methods. Aim 1 will focus on the deployment and progressive improvement of a cloud-based database for image management based on the OMERO standard as well as a parallel system for access to primary data. Aim 2 will develop and deploy software for visualizing HTAN image data by the general public. The IDP will use the existing MCWG and DAWG mechanisms for oversight and reporting, and all centers will be invited to participate. Within IDP, the HMS PCA will take primary responsibility for initial deployment of image informatics software. The DCC and HMS will jointly undertake software development and code hardening, and the DCC will take the lead in user assistance and software deployment, particularly in year two. Images of tumor specimens obtained from biopsy or surgery are one of the primary ways in which cancer is diagnosed and staged by pathologists, but such images have typically lacked molecular detail. The highly multiplexed tissue images being collected by HTAN will fundamentally change this, and it is therefore essential that the data be efficiently and widely distributed. The HTAN Image Data Project IDP will address an acute need for software for data dissemination and visualization.",Human Tumor Atlas Network: Data Coordinating Center Supplement,10206514,U24CA233243,"['Atlases ', ' Biopsy ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Client ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Collection ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Institutes ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Methods ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Vertebral column ', ' Spinal Column ', ' Spine ', ' backbone ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Generations ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' European ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Collaborations ', ' Pathologist ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Side ', ' Slide ', ' System ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' data management ', ' Performance ', ' Informatics ', ' Manuscripts ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Reporting ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Imaging Instrument ', ' Imaging Tool ', ' Imaging Device ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cell imaging ', ' cellular imaging ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Output ', ' imaging informatics ', ' Data Coordination Center ', ' Data Coordinating Center ', ' oncologic imaging ', ' oncology imaging ', ' tumor imaging ', ' cancer imaging ', ' Coupled ', ' imaging Segmentation ', ' computational resources ', ' computing resources ', ' computer algorithm ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' tumor ', ' relational database ', ' cloud based ', ' single cell sequencing ', ' data visualization ', ' Tissue imaging ', ' data resource ', ' Infrastructure ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' supervised learning ', ' multiplexed imaging ', ' Visualization ', ' data dissemination ', ' ']",NCI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,U24,2020,926364,MA-07,0.08673392322260881
"Deep learning for renal tumor characterization Our long-term objective is to develop deep learning techniques capable of predicting characteristics and treatment response or response to surveillance to assist clinical decision- making in renal tumors that are potential candidates for ablation therapy, biopsy, active surveillance or surgical resection. An increasing number of renal tumors are being diagnosed, due in part to incidental detection from the increased use of cross-sectional imaging. Although partial nephrectomy is still considered the primary treatment for small renal masses, percutaneous ablation is increasingly performed as a therapeutic, nephron-sparing approach. One challenge for interventional radiologists and urologists who manage these patients is selection for therapy, since the average rate of progression is slow for small renal tumors and metastasis rarely occurs. A technique that could distinguish indolent tumors from those will progress based on data from the imaging methods used to detect and delineate renal masses would enable early triage to observation versus invasive treatment. Deep learning, a type of machine learning technique which takes raw images as input, and applies many layers of transformations to calculate an output signal, has already led to breakthroughs in other areas of image recognition, and is increasingly used for medical image analysis. However, its application in the field of interventional radiology is currently limited. Furthermore, no study in the literature has applied deep learning to kidney lesion segmentation and characteristics/outcome prediction. In this project, we propose to develop novel deep learning architectures based on routine MR imaging that allow for accurate renal mass segmentation and prediction of characteristics and outcome in renal tumors. Using data from four independent cohorts, we will use our deep learning architectures to predict (1) benign versus malignant histology (2) growth rate in stage 1a renal cell carcinoma (3) SSIGN score in clear cell renal cell carcinoma and (4) clinical endpoints. We will integrate segmentation and classification into one net that suitable for clinical application. In addition, we will compare results with those of experts and traditional machine learning approaches. The inability to determine aggressiveness of renal tumors based on pretreatment imaging makes it challenging for urologists or interventional radiologists to select appropriate patients for active surveillance versus therapy with nephrectomy or ablation. Our research project uses deep learning to distinguish renal mass from normal tissue and predict characteristics, treatment response or response to surveillance in renal tumors. By using a multi-institutional patient cohort and conventional MR imaging sequences, we will demonstrate the generalizability and broad applicability of our algorithm. Our models have the potential to help guide clinical management of patients with renal tumors.",Deep learning for renal tumor characterization,9968604,R03CA249554,"['Algorithms ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Biopsy ', ' Renal Cell Carcinoma ', ' Grawitz Tumor ', ' Hypernephroid Carcinoma ', ' Hypernephroma ', ' Nephroid Carcinoma ', ' Renal Adenocarcinoma ', ' Renal Cell Adenocarcinoma ', ' Renal Cell Cancer ', ' kidney adenocarcinoma ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Dropout ', ' Future ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Histology ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Neoplasms ', ' Kidney Tumor ', ' Renal Neoplasms ', ' Renal Tumor ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Nephrectomy ', ' Nephrons ', ' Uriniferous Tube ', ' Patients ', ' Interventional radiology ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Triage ', ' Weight ', ' therapy selection ', ' Selection for Treatments ', ' Metastasis to the Kidney ', ' Metastatic Tumor to the Kidney ', ' Renal Metastasis ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm to the Kidney ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Area ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Malignant ', ' Malignant - descriptor ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' Indolent ', ' radiologist ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Urologist ', ' Kidney Mass ', ' Renal Mass ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' Oncology ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Normal Tissue ', ' Normal tissue morphology ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Clinic ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' interest ', ' Ablation ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Modeling ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Institution ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Clinical Management ', ' Update ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Output ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' oncologic imaging ', ' oncology imaging ', ' tumor imaging ', ' cancer imaging ', ' clinical applicability ', ' clinical application ', ' tumor ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' treatment response ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' learning network ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' outcome prediction ', ' radiomics ', ' ccRCC ', ' Clear cell renal cell carcinoma ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning ', ' random forest ', ' Patient imaging ', ' ']",NCI,RHODE ISLAND HOSPITAL,R03,2020,80500,RI-01,0.10445621059727184
"Molecular Mechanisms of Large Oncosome-Induced Prostate Cancer Progression and Metastasis Abstract Prostate cancer (PC) is one of the most frequent tumors in men. Despite recent progress, the disease is still incurable once resistance to castration therapy occurs. Tumor progression is strongly mediated by altered molecular exchanges between cancer cells and the surrounding milieu that originate at the primary sites. However, the mechanisms regulating the response of the stroma to the tumor, which ultimately promote PC progression are still largely unknown. Our laboratory discovered a new type of tumor-derived extracellular vesicle (EV), which are referred to as “large oncosomes” (LO), can harbor more abundant molecular cargo that is distinct and more potently bioactive than that carried by exosomes. The rationale for this proposal derives from our preliminary observations in patients that LO abundance in the circulation correlates with PC progression. Our functional data demonstrate that LO can activate oncogenic signaling in fibroblasts, which respond to LO uptake by activating MYC and SPI1 and by induce a transcriptional program that promotes angiogenesis and stimulates tumor growth. The overarching goal of this project is to determine the functional role of LO in PC progression and metastasis. We hypothesize that LO functionally reprogram normal prostate-associated fibroblasts (NAF) toward a phenotype that is driven by MYC and SPI1 activation. These results strongly suggest that tumor-derived LO might activate intercellular responses that are specific to this subtype of extracellular vesicle. Our hypothesis will be tested with three Specific Aims: Aim 1: To investigate the role of LO-induced fibroblast activation in PC progression. Aim 2: To find evidence that the LO- induced transcriptional program is active in PC patients with clinically significant disease. Aim 3: To test if LO and/or Exo derived from PC patient and PDX specimens promote castration resistance and/or bone metastasis. We will use a combination of complementary in vitro and animal orthotopic models as well as focused approaches involving genome editing, molecular barcodes, and a Cre-Lox reporter in vivo system. Our study will determine if the transcriptional program induced by LO in vitro drives tumor progression and metastasis in vivo. Additionally we will determine if this transcriptional program can also be identified in patient specimens and if it indicative of tumor progression. Finally, our study will provide evidence for LO abilities to induce metastasis of indolent PC cells. PROJECT NARRATIVE In this project we will perform functional tests of a newly-identified class of tumor-derived extracellular vesicle, referred to as large oncosomes. These shed vesicles are products of metastatic prostate cancer cells and we have obtained evidence that they are potent effectors of conditioning of the tumor microenvironment in a manner that promotes disease progression. Here we will examine their potential role in stroma-supported tumor progression and metastasis and the novel molecular mechanisms underlying this process.",Molecular Mechanisms of Large Oncosome-Induced Prostate Cancer Progression and Metastasis,9981710,R01CA234557,"['Animals ', ' Bar Codes ', ' barcode ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood Circulation ', ' Bloodstream ', ' Circulation ', ' Bone Marrow ', ' Bone Marrow Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Castration ', ' Surgical Castration ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Endothelium ', ' Fibroblasts ', ' Foundations ', ' Gene Deletion ', ' gene deletion mutation ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' In Vitro ', ' Laboratories ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Morphogenesis ', ' morphogenetic process ', ' Neoplasm Metastasis ', ' Metastasis ', ' Metastasize ', ' Metastatic Lesion ', ' Metastatic Mass ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Tumor ', ' Secondary Neoplasm ', ' Secondary Tumor ', ' cancer metastasis ', ' tumor cell metastasis ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Plasma ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Play ', ' Prostate ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Metastatic to ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Work ', ' Mediating ', ' Bone Metastasis ', ' Bone cancer metastatic ', ' Bony metastasis ', ' Metastasis to bone ', ' Metastatic Cancer to the Bone ', ' Metastatic Tumor to the Bone ', ' Metastatic malignant neoplasm to bone ', ' Osseous metastasis ', ' Secondary cancer of bone ', ' Secondary malignancy of bone ', ' Secondary malignant neoplasm of bone ', ' Skeletal metastasis ', ' bone neoplasm secondary ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm to the Bone ', ' base ', ' cancer progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' tumor progression ', ' Site ', ' Solid ', ' Clinical ', ' Malignant ', ' Malignant -

"UCSC-Buck Specialized Genomic Data Analysis Center for the Genomic Data Analysis Network The “UCSC-Buck Genome Data Analysis Center for the Genomic Data Analysis Network” will develop state-of-the-art methods for integrating various types of data to discover the genetic pathways, the microenvironment, the originating cells, and the oncogenic processes driving the initiation and progression of tumors. The long term goals of the project are to identify highly accurate models detailing the faulty genetic circuitry at work in each subclone of a patient’s tumor, as well as any “normal” cells acting as accomplices by supporting the cancer microenvironment. The ultimate objective is to encode computer algorithms that can search a patient’s individual pathway diagram for the best combination of interventions to eliminate every tumor cell, while preserving the health of every normal cell, in their body. Integrative pathway analysis methods will be developed to reveal signatures of tumor subtypes from Pan-Cancer and external datasets. New technologies will be established for uncovering network models tailored to individual patients. The tools will be deployed as part of an active collaboration to support the specific projects of the Genome Data Analysis Network. Novel probabilistic graphical models will be used to infer disrupted signaling. Cellular signatures will be collected from the analysis of normal cells, cancer cell line models, and Pan-Cancer investigations. Novel machine-learning methods, guided by pathway mechanisms, will be established to identify cell state signatures in heterogeneous patient samples. This work will reveal rare mutations driving metastatic transformation that are currently of unknown significance. New clues about the genetic circuitry promoting response and resistance to treatment will be established. Finally, cross-tumor connections that relate tumors of one type to a different type will suggest new avenues for treatment. Computational strategies for interpreting the results of cancer genome sequencing projects are in  desperate need. To select appropriate treatment strategies for a patient, an accurate model of the  altered genetic wiring in the tumor is needed as well as how that wiring relates to other tumors  and to other normal cells at various stages of differentiation.

"Development and Dissemination of KiNet: A Novel Imaging Informatics Tool for Gastrointestinal and Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors PROJECT SUMMARY Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are one heterogeneous type of cancer affecting most organ systems. NETs must be correctly graded to ensure proper treatment and patient management. The proliferation index, as measured by Ki67 nuclear staining, is required for gastrointestinal (GI) and pancreatic NET grading per the criteria of the World Health Organization (WHO). Measuring the Ki67 labeling index (Ki67 LI) from pathology images requires accurate quantification of immunopositive tumor, immunonegative tumor and non-tumor cells. This process is an essential procedure in basic, translational and clinical research and in routine clinical practice. However, current Ki67 image analysis tools have a number of drawbacks: 1) Ki67 LI assessment is still mainly achieved with manual or semi-automated methods, leading to increased labor costs, awkward workflows, low-throughput image analysis and significant potential inter- and intra-observer variability; 2) computer-aided Ki67 counting is error-prone due to the multi-stage image processing design, where each stage itself is a very challenging task; 3) current algorithm design does not take into consideration the characteristics of Ki67 images such that it has technical difficulty in classifying different types of cells in Ki67 stained images. In this proposed research, we seek to develop and disseminate a novel deep learning-based imaging informatics system, KiNeT, specifically for better automated Ki67 LI measurement in GI and pancreatic NETs. KiNet will take advantage of cutting-edge machine learning algorithms, deep fully convolutional networks (FCNs), to develop an end-to-end, pixel-to-pixel model for single-stage Ki67 LI assessment. To this end, we will first formulate Ki67 counting as a cell identification problem and solve it using class-aware structured regression modeling within a novel FCN network. This network will simultaneously detect and classify immunopositive tumor, immunonegative tumor and non-tumor cells. Next, we will further enhance cell identification with another related task, extraction of regions of interest (ROIs), which will differentiate tumor from non-tumor regions by taking Ki67 image characteristics into consideration. These two tasks will be unified into one single neural network and jointly learned to benefit both cell identification and region classification. KiNet will provide a novel computational method for accurate Ki67 LI assessment, thereby enabling early detection and targeted treatments of the diseases. Compared to manual counting and current Ki67 image analysis methods, it will significantly improve the objectivity, consistency, reliability, reproducibility and efficiency. Additionally, the proposed single-stage Ki67 counting strategy, which is completely different from current multi-stage Ki67 image analysis pipelines, will provide a new perspective for Ki67 image quantification. PROJECT NARRATIVE Ki67 labeling index (LI) is a reliable and critical biomarker to grade gastrointestinal (GI) and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). This biomarker computation requires accurate quantification of immunopositive tumor, immunonegative tumor and non-tumor cells.

"High-Throughput Functional Genomics to Guide Precision Oncology in Gastrointestinal Tumors Abstract:  This is an application for a K22 award for Dr. John Paul Shen, a medical oncologist currently at the University of California, San Diego. Dr. Shen is establishing himself as a young translational investigator in the field of cancer genomics. This K22 award will provide Dr. Shen with the resources and training to accomplish the following objectives; (1) implement advanced computational methods on genome scale datasets (2) become an expert in functional genomics, (3) achieve proficiency experimenting in mouse models of cancer, (4) successfully manage an independent laboratory. To achieve these objectives, after accepting a faculty position Dr. Shen will assemble a diverse advisory committee including experts in bioinformatics, experimental cancer biology, and clinical oncology.  It was proposed by many that the ability to sequence a tumor genome, now made possible by next- generation sequencing, would bring about a new era of precision oncology in which chemotherapy choices would be individualized to match a single tumor and patient. However, the use genomic information in clinical practice remains limited by the fact that currently very few mutations are associated with response to a specific drug. This is particularly true in Gastrointestinal (GI) malignancies, where there are few targeted therapy options and few effective biomarkers help guide chemotherapy selection. Dr. Shen seeks to address this pressing need by employing high-throughput functional genomic methods to identify tumor specific vulnerabilities that could be exploited therapeutically.  Recognizing that there will be great heterogeneity from one tumor to the next, even within the same cancer type, the functional genomic data created here will be combined with systems biology methods to identify how the vulnerabilities of each unique tumor can be predicted with information readily available to a clinical oncologist. Using network-based machine learning methods applied to chemo-genomic viability data in molecularly characterize cell lines it is expected that predictive biomarkers will be identified for both novel targeted agents and currently used chemotherapy drugs. This will allow oncologists to design individualized chemotherapy regimens for each patient. Project Narrative  Although the development of targeted anti-cancer therapies has had a major impact on many tumor types, there is currently a lack of effective targeted drugs for patients with cancers of the Gastrointestinal (GI) tract.

"In vivo dual-axis confocal microscopy of 5-ALA-induced PpIX to guide low-grade glioma resections Summary Extent-of-resection is correlated with glioma patient outcomes such as progression-free survival. Image- guidance technologies, based on MRI and now fluorescence-guided surgery (FGS), have been developed to improve the surgeon’s ability to visualize gross tumor margins. However, there are fundamental limitations to wide-field imaging methods such as MRI and FGS, such as poor sensitivity to detect disseminated tumor cells at the infiltrative margins of diffuse gliomas, as well as the non-quantitative and subjective nature of image interpretation. With the emergence of FGS using 5-ALA, and its recent approval by the FDA in 2017, the gap between low-grade glioma (LGG) and high-grade glioma (HGG) patients, in terms of extent of resection, will likely widen since LGGs rarely generate sufficient PpIX fluorescence to be detected via wide-field FGS. Consequently, there is a clear need for improved intraoperative techniques with the sensitivity to detect and quantify residual LGGs at the margins of the tumor cavity in order to improve the extent of resection and delay recurrence. We have shown that high-resolution confocal microscopy has the sensitivity to visualize the sparse sub-cellular expression of PpIX in LGG patients treated with 5-ALA, even beyond the radiographic margins. Therefore, we will optimize a handheld optical-sectioning microscope to image 5-ALA-induced PpIX at the final resection margins in LGG patients, together with real-time video mosaicking to facilitate the imaging of large tissue areas, which will minimize sampling bias when imaging heterogeneous brain tissues (Aim 1). In order to facilitate the clinical acceptance of these techniques, we will establish a relationship between the microscopic patterns of PpIX expression and well-established biological metrics such as tumor burden and proliferative index (Aim 2). Finally, we will explore the hypothesis that quantitative microscopic imaging of PpIX of the resection margins is predictive of extent of resection, as currently defined by post-operative MRI, which would suggest that it has value for optimizing resections to minimize and/or delay recurrence (Aim 3). Collectively, these results will pave the way for future randomized controlled clinical studies to optimize resection procedures and outcomes for LGG patients (adults and children), many of whom can have good survival outcomes and quality of life. Relevance to public health We are developing a set of technologies to enable real-time intraoperative microscopy of the final resection margins of low-grade glioma (LGG) patients who have been administered with 5-ALA prior to surgery (FDA approved in 2017). These quantitative and sensitive imaging techniques have the potential to improve the extent of resection for LGG patients, and therefore to improve patient outcomes such as overall survival and progression-free survival (time to recurrence).",In vivo dual-axis confocal microscopy of 5-ALA-induced PpIX to guide low-grade glioma resections,9859167,R01CA244170,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Aminolevulinic Acid ', ' 5-ALA ', ' 5-Amino-4-oxopentanoic Acid ', ' 5-Aminolevulinic Acid ', ' 5-amino-4-oxo-pentanoic acid ', ' Amino-Levulinic Acid ', ' Delta-Aminolevulinic Acid ', ' d-Amino-Levulinic Acid ', ' Sampling Biases ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Engineering ', ' Fluorescence ', ' Future ', ' Glioma ', ' Glial Cell Tumors ', ' Glial Neoplasm ', ' Glial Tumor ', ' Neuroglial Neoplasm ', ' Neuroglial Tumor ', ' glial-derived tumor ', ' neuroglia neoplasm ', ' neuroglia tumor ', ' Histology ', ' Immunohistochemistry ', ' Immunohistochemistry Cell/Tissue ', ' Immunohistochemistry Staining Method ', ' Institutes ', ' instrumentation ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Methods ', ' Microscopy ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Patients ', ' Postoperative Period ', ' Post-Operative ', ' Postoperative ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Diagnostic radiologic examination ', ' Conventional X-Ray ', ' Diagnostic Radiology ', ' Diagnostic X-Ray ', ' Diagnostic X-Ray Radiology ', ' Radiography ', ' Roentgenography ', ' X-Ray Imaging ', ' X-Ray Medical Imaging ', ' Xray imaging ', ' Xray medical imaging ', ' conventional Xray ', ' diagnostic Xray ', ' diagnostic Xray radiology ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' Microscope ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Diffuse ', ' Microscopic ', ' Residual ', ' Residual state ', ' Biological ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Training ', ' Surgical margins ', ' Progression-Free Survivals ', ' Confocal Microscopy ', ' Pathologist ', ' Nature ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' brain tissue ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Surgeon ', ' Tumor Cell ', ' neoplastic cell ', ' Performance ', ' sterile ', ' Sterility ', ' Speed ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Cell Proliferative Activity ', ' Cellular Proliferation Rate ', ' Mitotic Index ', ' Proliferation Index ', ' S-Phase Fraction ', ' Sampling ', ' intra-operative imaging ', ' intraoperative imaging ', ' surgical imaging ', ' Image-Guided Surgery ', ' Frameless Stereotaxy ', ' Neuronavigation ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Tumor Load ', ' Tumor Burden ', ' Biophotonics ', ' Data ', ' Proliferation Marker ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Collection ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Validation ', ' Molecular ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Imaging technology ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' prototype ', ' tumor ', ' lenses ', ' lens ', ' overexpress ', ' overexpression ', ' FDA approved ', ' industrial partnership ', ' industry partnership ', ' industry partner ', ' image guidance ', ' image guided ', ' survival outcome ', ' microscope imaging ', ' microscopy imaging ', ' microscopic imaging ', ' high resolution imaging ', ' fluorescence-guided surgery ', ' automatic algorithm ', ' automated algorithm ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2020,607334,WA-07,0.07804500868280485
"Integrated Informatic and Experimental Evaluations of Cancer Chronotherapy ABSTRACT Years of clinical experience and a growing body of basic research suggest that chemotherapeutic activity can change with time-of-day. But when should our patients take their medicines? Must we test each new agent for circadian modulation in both efficacy and toxicity? Which tumors are most sensitive to chemotherapy administration time? Can we tailor our recommendations for individual patients? Temporal variation in the abundance of drug targets, transporters, and metabolizing enzymes, in both tumors and normal tissues, underlies circadian variation in drug activity. Until recently almost all we knew about tissue specific circadian rhythms came from normal mice. Without human data, a mechanistic, hypothesis-driven transition to medical practice has been slow. Recently we developed CYCLOPS (CYCLic Ordering by Periodic Structure) a machine-learning algorithm to uncover human transcriptional oscillations using existing, unordered biopsy samples. We used CYCLOPS to explore circadian rhythms in human lung and liver, identify disrupted rhythms in hepatocellular carcinoma, and predict circadian changes in drug effectiveness. This proposal will greatly expand that work and accelerate its translation to clinical oncology. Using public data, we will describe the molecular rhythms in an array of normal human tissues and thus the times of day when these tissues are least sensitive to specific drug toxicities. We will also describe rhythms in select tumors, identifying circadian times and cell cycle phases when cancers are most distinct from surrounding tissue and thus uniquely sensitive to various treatments. We will explore the influence of specific mutations and tumor markers on the rhythms observed in patients. Mapping these data onto pharmacogenomics databases we can make testable prediction as to the drugs and side effects most influenced by circadian time. Finally using both experimental mouse data and our preliminary human results, we have compiled a list of some of the most promising chronotheraputic candidates. We will expand and refine this list over the course of the study, testing several of these predictions in established animal models, and exploring the promise and practical principles of cancer chronotherapy. Taken together these aims will help catalyze chronotheraputic translation to clinical oncology and help delineate the role of time in precision cancer therapy.

"Comprehensive characterization of the cancer microbiome and its immuno-oncology interface Project Summary/Abstract  Cancer has long been described as a disease of the human genome, and the past two decades of research have largely focused on characterizing the molecular mechanisms that contribute to its origin, progression, and treatment resistance.1,2,28–30 Over the past year, a series of seminal studies have identified significant non-human, microbial contributions in the development and advancement of solid tumors, hematologic malignancies, and germline cancer syndromes, as well as the variable efficacy of chemo- and immunotherapy, shedding light on what may be considered cancer’s ‘second’ genome (the metagenome).3–11,25 The extent of these microbial contributions across diverse cancer types in the human body and their implications on broader clinical management, however, remain largely unknown.12 Answering basic questions regarding the presence and specificity of such microbes in certain cancer types and cancer stages could guide the rational design of new, microbially-based diagnostics, prognostics, and therapies. Further, addressing more complex questions regarding the interactions of these microbes with cancer and host immune cells in the tumor microenvironment could provide critical insight into the design of personalized immunotherapy, cancer vaccines, and cancer risk profiles, hopefully leading to improved patient outcomes.  This proposal builds on a recent analysis of the cancer microbiome in 14,038 primary tumors, through which I have shown that virtually every major tumor type in the human body carries a unique, discriminative microbial signature. Inspired by recent evidence that highlights the role of pathogen-centric immunobiology in cancer development16,17 and the ability of microbes to powerfully modulate the systemic and local immune systems,5,6,8,18 I now hypothesize that the broad existence of these cancer microbes provides an evolutionary advantage for tumors to escape the host immune system’s recognition and response. I also hypothesize that the same immunological processes that are known to shape cancer’s mutational and phenotypic landscapes are concurrently shaping the tumor microbiota. Armed with patient germline HLA allele data and inferred immune cell abundances in the same primary tumors as those in our cancer microbiome study, I believe these hypotheses are finally testable. Aim 1 of this project seeks to investigate them alongside immunotherapy response data.21,22 Complementarily, Aim 2 seeks to define the intratumoral spatial distribution of the cancer microbiome and associated immune cells using a combination of computational and wet lab analyses. These results will contribute to our foundational knowledge on what is becoming the immuno-oncology-microbiome (IOM) axis.  The proposed interdisciplinary research will take place at UC San Diego in collaboration with microbiome, systems biology, tumor immunology, pathology, and oncology experts, who serve as mentors and advisors to me. Through their invaluable mentorship, hands-on learning, networking, and additional graduate coursework, I will grow into the translational and effective physician-scientist I so desire to be. Project Narrative The long-held view that cancer is a “sterile” entity is starting to change. New evidence suggests that intratumoral microbes can affect the development, progression, and treatment resistance of solid tumors. My preliminary findings suggest that unique microbial signatures exist for every major tumor type in the human body, and this proposal extends that work to characterize the interfaces between these cancer microbes, cancer cells, and the host immune system.",Comprehensive characterization of the cancer microbiome and its immuno-oncology interface,9911763,F30CA243480,"['Affect ', ' Alleles ', '

"Multi-parametric 4-D Imaging Biomarkers for Neoadjuvant Treatment Response ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Imaging plays a critical role in evaluating tumor response to treatment; however the currently used methods remain significantly limited. For example, standards such as the RECIST are subjective and cannot be used to adequately characterize irregular lesions; tumor volume measures alone do not account for detailed structural changes; and features from selected tumor regions, such as ""hot-spot"" peak-enhancement, do not capture information from the entire tumor. As such, current approaches fall short of capturing the multi-faceted effects of treatment, including phenotypic tumor heterogeneity and its longitudinal change during treatment, which is increasingly recognized as an important predictive indicator. To date, few studies have explored using richer imaging descriptors, which could result in more powerful predictive markers. Moreover, fewer have attempted to combine multi-modal biomarkers, such as imaging with histopathologic and molecular markers, to develop enhanced predictive models for specific tumor sub-types and individual patients. We propose to develop advanced computational tools that will enable to i) extract novel multi-parametric imaging signatures and ii) accurately characterize their longitudinal patterns of change during neoadjuvant treatment via deformable image registration. Our approach is thus geared towards knowledge discovery, for determining which imaging parameters have the highest predictive value out of many possible ways to quantify information provided by imaging. In SA1 we will develop robust 4D deformable image registration methods, based on principles of mutual saliency, for estimating transformations that will enable us to robustly register serial imaging scans and obtain anatomically precise spatio-temporal parametric maps of longitudinal tissue effects induced by treatment. In SA2 we will analyze whole-tumor and normal tissue effects by performing multi- parametric feature extraction, including a rich set of morphologic, textural, kinetic and parenchymal tissue descriptors, which in conjunction to registration will allow us to comprehensively capture the dynamically evolving imaging phenotype during treatment. In SA3 we will test our method in a major breast imaging study, the I-SPY 1/ACRIN 6657 trial. We will apply machine learning tools to identify high-dimensional associations of imaging patterns, in conjunction to histopathologic tumor subtyping, that can best predict pathologic complete response (pCR) and 5-year disease free survival (DFS). In SA4 we will independently test our models with the I-SPY 2/ACRIN 6698 trial, where we will also evaluate the robustness of our features to a diverse range of treatments. Our methods hold the promise to shift the current paradigm in personalizing neoadjuvant treatment by 1) improving the current standards of imaging-based assessment and 2) introducing new imaging biomarkers that can be of higher value as early predictors of treatment response and survival. Our tools will be shared as open-source software via NIH/NCI tool registries and open-challenge activities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Pattern analysis and machine learning methods are powerful knowledge discovery tools that can be very effective in identifying complex multi-parametric patterns from a diverse set of imaging and non-imaging biomarkers that can best predict treatment response and outcome. Our method will leverage the richness of available data to point to new imaging biomarkers that are better early predictors of response, enabling personalized treatment decisions for women undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer.",Multi-parametric 4-D Imaging Biomarkers for Neoadjuvant Treatment Response,9895669,R01CA197000,"['Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic

"Bronchoscope-guided microwave ablation of early-stage lung tumors PROJECT SUMMARY In this Industry-Academic partnership R01 research plan, we propose the development, optimization, and pilot first-in-human evaluation of a bronchoscope-guided microwave ablation (MWA) system for rapid and conformal thermal ablation of early stage pulmonary tumors. Minimally-invasive, image- guided MWA is a cost-effective treatment for thermal destruction of unresectable tumors in the liver, lung, kidney, and other organs. Current MWA technology for pulmonary tumors is limited to a percutaneous approach, which precludes treatment of central tumors and has a high associated risk of pneumothorax. Furthermore, limited intra-procedural feedback and lack of guidance and treatment planning tools places a substantial burden on the physician to precisely position applicators and ensure adequate ablation of the target, while limiting damage to non-targets. Virtual bronchoscopy and navigation, pioneered by Broncus Medical (industrial partner), affords accurate, minimally-invasive access to early-stage pulmonary tumors, with minimal risk of pneumothorax, compared to a percutaneous approach. The team at Kansas State University (academic partner) will develop optimized flexible microwave applicators for delivering localized thermal ablation to pulmonary tumors via a bronchoscopic approach. The proposed MWA devices include antennas with directional control of microwave power deposition for precise ablation of small targets, and will be extensively evaluated with computational models and experimentally, on the benchtop, and in an in vivo animal model. Transient changes in antenna impedance matching will be exploited as a feedback parameter for assessing ablation progress. A machine-learning based treatment planning and guidance platform will be developed and integrated with Broncus’ Archimedes planning and virtual bronchoscopy platform to guide the selection of optimal treatment parameters. The integrated system will be translated for first-in- human studies to evaluate the feasibility and safety of bronchoscopically delivering MWA for targeting pulmonary tumors (subaward with University of British Columbia, through Broncus Medical). The central hypothesis of this research is that a bronchoscopic MWA system integrating: (1) applicators with directional control of ablation profiles; (2) impedance-based intra-procedural feedback; and (3) bronchoscopic guidance and treatment planning tools, will afford the safe and effective treatment of localized early-stage pulmonary tumors. The proposed research will lead to the development of an integrated system for bronchoscopic ablation of pulmonary tumors, and its pilot feasibility assessment in human patients.

"Quantifying Multiscale Competitive Landscapes of Clonal Diversity in Glioblastoma ABSTRACT  Glioblastoma (GBM) exhibits profound intratumoral molecular heterogeneity that contributes to treatment resistance and poor survival. Specifically, each tumor comprises multiple molecularly-distinct subpopulations with different treatment sensitivities. This heterogeneity not only portends the pre-existence of resistant molecular subpopulations, but also the communications between neighboring subpopulations that further modulate tumorigenicity and resistance. In fact, a minority tumor subpopulation with EGFRvIII mutation has been shown to potentiate a majority subpopulation with wild-type EGFR to increase tumor growth, cell survival, and drug resistance. This type of cooperativity presents clear implications for improving GBM treatment. Yet compared to other tumor types, the interactions in GBM remain critically understudied.  A significant barrier to studying the interactions between molecularly-distinct subpopulations is the challenge of tissue sampling in GBM. In particular, contrast-enhanced MRI (CE-MRI) routinely guides surgical biopsy and resection of the MRI enhancing core, but fails to address the diverse subpopulations of the surrounding non-enhancing parenchyma (so called “brain around tumor” or BAT). These unresected residual subpopulations in BAT represent the main contributors to tumor recurrence, which can exhibit different therapeutic targets (and interactions) compared with enhancing biopsies. To address the limitations of tissue sampling, imaging techniques can help quantitatively characterize tumors in their entirety, including unresected BAT regions. Our group has used multi-parametric MRI and image-guided biopsies to develop and validate machine-learning (ML) models of intratumoral genomic heterogeneity, with particular focus on the BAT zone.  In Aim 1, will we collect and molecularly profile a large set of image-recorded stereotactic biopsies in primary GBM patients to quantify the diversity of molecularly-distinct subpopulations, as well as their phenotypic niches, throughout the BAT zone. We will assess local heterogeneity at the biopsy level and also co-localize regional patterns and rates of recurrence on serial MRI. In Aim 2, we will use these biopsies and spatially matched MRI metrics to refine our existing ML predictive models. We will use these ML models to co- localize spatial patterns of molecularly-distinct subpopulations (and their phenotypic niches) to quantify their risk of regional recurrence. In Aim 3, we will functionally validate the subpopulation interactions observed in Aims 1 and 2 using patient derived xenograft (PDX) models. We will also validate these interactions in human GBM using a subset of spatially matched biopsies from primary and recurrent tumors in the same patients. This proposal leverages our unique expertise in image-guided tissue analysis and MRI-based computational modeling to study the diversity of molecularly-distinct subpopulations and the evolving competitive landscapes in human GBM. This work will help risk stratify patients in future targeted clinical drug trials and should also facilitate new strategies (e.g., adaptive therapy) to exploit subpopulation co-dependency for therapeutic benefit. PROJECT NARRATIVE  We propose here a novel strategy that identifies the potential molecular underpinnings of treatment resistance within the zone where tumor almost always recurs. By developing image-based models that quantify the diversity of molecularly-distinct subpopulations (and their interactions) within individual tumors, the proposed work will improve image-based diagnosis and therapeutic strategies in the paradigm of individualized oncology.",Quantifying Multiscale Competitive Landscapes of Clonal Diversity in Glioblastoma,10155013,U01CA220378,"['Biopsy ', '

"An Academic-Industry Partnership to Advance Functional Genomics for Personalized Oncology. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Oregon Health & Science University and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center have worked over the past decade to develop ex vivo drug profiling to guide a rationale decision-making in assigning drugs to cancer patients, thereby improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs. A number of recent breakthroughs, many developed through our partnership, have dramatically improved on nearly all aspects of ex vivo drug testing. Our work to date has led to numerous compassionate-use cases as well as new investigator initiated clinical trials. Recognizing the broad utility for a clinic-friendly ex vivo drug sensitivity platform, we set up a commercial entity, SEngine Precision Medicine, whose mission is to provide functional testing of patient derived tumor cells for research, clinical studies, and drug development. Here we seek to move beyond proof of concept in the assay toward wider adoption by cancer research centers, community hospitals, and individual users. We will benchmark the assay’s predictive performance in both “N of 1” settings and in prospective observational studies, and use this baseline performance to drive the development of methods to further improve its predictive value. We will continue to optimize drug selection by integrating ex vivo drug testing with patient specific genomic profiling and clinical data. In parallel, we will develop a reporting system, based upon requirements analysis, for potential end users such as clinicians and academic research centers. OHSU will provide expertise in precision medicine for AML, functional testing of primary leukemia cells, and clinical trials and will assist with assay optimization. FHCRC will provide expertise in functional testing of cells derived from solid tumors, focusing first on breast cancer, cancer genomics, and clinical trials; and will assist with assay optimization and benchmarking. SEngine will develop CLIA certified assays, optimize sample analysis workflows, and develop a reporting system for end users. All three sites will work together to demonstrate inter-institutional proficiency of the assays. At least five additional academic centers have agreed to provide patient derived tumor cells for this project and we anticipate this number will increase during the granting period. The partnering institutions will also provide essential feedback for our performance and reporting system. Our end goals for this project are to produce a refined functional genomic platform based on ex vivo drug screens, a user-friendly reporting interface, and adoption of the technology in the clinical care decision-making process. PROJECT NARRATIVE The ability to provide effective therapy recommendations to cancer patients is limited by our capacity to predict which drugs will work for a given patient. Our platform overcomes this limitation by testing a set of available anti- cancer drugs on tumor cells cultured directly from cancer patients. Through an extensive academic/industry partnership, we propose to refine and benchmark this platform, improve its predictive power, and provide a user- friendly reporting interface to facilitate its adoption by cancer care providers.  ",An Academic-Industry Partnership to Advance Functional Genomics for Personalized Oncology.,9827559,R01CA214428,"['Adoption ', ' Antineoplastic Agents ', ' Anti-Cancer Agents ', ' Antineoplastic Drugs ', ' Antineoplastics ', ' Cancer Drug ', ' Neoplastic Disease Chemotherapeutic Agents ', ' Tumor-Specific Treatment Agents ', ' anti-cancer drug ', ' anticancer agent ', ' anticancer drug ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Certification ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Decision Making ', ' Designer Drugs ', ' Customized Drugs ', ' Drug Combinations ', ' Drug Industry ', ' Pharmaceutic Industry ', ' Pharmaceutical Industry ', ' Drug resistance ', ' drug resistant ', ' resistance to Drug ', ' resistant to Drug ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Economics ', ' Feedback ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Community Hospitals ', ' Acute Myelocytic Leukemia ', ' AML -

"Multi-Omic Single-Cell System for Improved Combination Cancer Immunotherapy Monitoring and Implementation IsoPlexis proposes to deliver a novel multi-omic method for targeted profiling of both the TCR sequence and proteome from an array of 1000+ single cells. Specifically, we will deliver a single-cell, TCR sequencing and protein capture assay for identifying responsive antigen specific TCRs, and concurrently evaluate these T-cells for functional response to that antigen. The challenge remains to link the activation of quiescent T-cell embedded in tumors by combination immunotherapies to patient outcome. Determining the combination of therapies to which each individual patient best responds indicates the best course of treatment. The quality of single-cell polyfunctional response of these immune cells correlates to positive outcomes far better than traditional bulk analysis. For example, PD-1 is upregulated upon T-cell activation while PD-L1 is expressed by a range of cell types. Since PD-1/PD-L1 interactions negatively regulate T cell immune function, PD-1/PD-L1 blockade can rescue effector T cell function. Critical to analyzing TILs is to assess (1) these T-cells’ function in the tumor environment in order to enable trial leaders to predict responders vs non-responders, a critical problem in immuno-oncology, and (2) to understand the TCR Sequence of the highest functioning cells. IsoPlexis single- cell secretion analysis exceeds its competition in the generation and quantitation of highly-multiplexed, single- cell data. Additional single-cell data from the TCR sequence would help to link antigen specificity to polyfunctional T cells involved in patient response, for improved biomarkers and targeted T-cell therapy development. We propose the following specific aims: (1) develop SCBC flow cell for the dual capture of multiplexed proteins and transcriptome on-device. (2a) produce a miniaturized and benchtop automated instrument of the existing instrument for multi-omic applications. 2b) develop a software suite for automated data processing and intuitive integrated informatics of polyfunctional and transcriptome data. 3) Establish patient learning of phenotype & genotype information in multiple trials, applied with machine learning of large patient genotype/phenotype data. At the end of our Phase II grant, we will demonstrate a dual TCR/proteomic assay on a fully-automated miniaturized SCBC instrument, the IsoMini, and software suite that will be successfully used across three combination therapy trials at Yale, Stanford and Fred Hutch. As successes in personalized medicine have continued to move the field forward, there is a growing need to predict responder differences in combination cancer therapies. The challenge remains to link the activation of quiescent T-cell embedded in tumors (TILs) by combination immunotherapies to patient outcome. IsoPlexis automated high-throughput platform using highly-multiplexed, single-cell measurements allows the simultaneous identification of both antigen specificity by TCR sequencing and functional effects by polyfunctional cytokine secretion. This would allow clinicians to finally have a tool to identify the specific TCR of the highest responding TILs necessary for the effective development of combination therapies.",Multi-Omic Single-Cell

"Isolating and mitigating sequentially dependent perceptual errors in clinical visual search Project Summary When looking at an x-ray, radiologists are typically asked to localize a tumor (if present), and to classify it, judging its size, class, position and so on. Importantly, during this task, radiologists examine on a daily basis hundreds and hundreds of x-rays, seeing several images one after the other. A main underlying assumption of this task is that radiologists’ percepts and decisions on a current X-ray are completely independent of prior events. Recent results showed that this is not true: our perception and decisions are strongly biased by our past visual experience. Although serial dependencies were proposed to be a purposeful mechanism to achieve perceptual stability of our otherwise noisy visual input, serial dependencies play a crucial and deleterious role in the everyday task performed by radiologists. For example, an x-ray containing a tumor can be classified as benign depending on the content of the previously seen x-ray. Given the importance and the impact of serial dependencies in clinical tasks, in this proposal, we plan to (1) establish, (2) identify and (3) mitigate the conditions under which serial effects determine our percepts and decisions in tumor search tasks. In Aim 1, we will establish the presence of serial effects in four different clinically relevant domains: tumor detection, tumor classification, tumor position and recognition speed. In Aim 2, we plan to identify the specific boundary conditions under which visual serial dependence impacts tumor search in radiology. In Aim 3, once we will fully understand these boundary conditions in Aim 2, we will propose a series of task and stimulus manipulations to control and mitigate the deleterious effects of visual serial dependence on tumor search. As a result of these manipulations, visual search performance should improve in measurable ways (detection, classification, position, speed). Aim 3 is particularly crucial because it will allow us to propose new guidelines which will greatly improve tumor recognition in x-ray images, making this task even more effective and reliable. Taken together, the proposed studies in Aim 1, 2, and 3 will allow us to establish, identify, and mitigate the deleterious effect of serial dependencies in radiological search tasks, which could have a significant impact on the health and well-being of patients everywhere. ! ! ! Project Narrative Our proposal is designed to investigate the detrimental impact of visual serial dependencies in clinical settings. Serial dependencies significantly impact our perceptual experience, but little is known about their detrimental consequences when radiologists are asked to detect tumors in x-rays. Crucially, the final goal of our research project is to develop recommendations and guidelines to mitigate the negative effect of serial effects and, thus, improve diagnosis accuracy.",Isolating and mitigating sequentially dependent perceptual errors in clinical visual search,9917724,R01CA236793,"['Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Judgment ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Play ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' General Radiology ', ' Radiology ', ' Reading ', ' Recommendation ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Diagnostic radiologic examination ', ' Conventional X-Ray ', ' Diagnostic Radiology ', ' Diagnostic X-Ray ', ' Diagnostic X-Ray Radiology ', ' Radiography ', ' Roentgenography ', ' X-Ray Imaging ', ' X-Ray Medical Imaging ', ' Xray imaging ', ' Xray medical imaging ', ' conventional Xray ', ' diagnostic Xray ', ' diagnostic Xray radiology ', ' Roentgen Rays ', ' X-Radiation ', ' X-Ray Radiation ', ' X-ray ', ' Xray ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' Stimulus ', ' Visual ', ' radiologist ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Dependence ', ' Event ', ' Scanning ', ' Visual System ', ' Visual system structure ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Accuracy of Diagnosis ', ' diagnostic accuracy ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' visual search ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Measurable ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Impairment ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' tumor ', ' lab assignment ', ' lab experiment ', ' laboratory activity ', ' laboratory assignment ', ' laboratory exercise ', ' laboratory experiment ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2020,312511,CA-13,0.06375684556286822
"The Mechanism of SOX6 in Ewing Sarcoma Metastasis Project Summary Current survival rates of pediatric cancers like leukemia have seen drastic positive response in survival and treatment in the last 20 years. In stark contrast, patients with solid tumor metastasis challenge the current paradigm of intense chemotherapy treatment. Such treatments have failed to change the poor prognosis of metastatic disease indicating a need to understand the complex underpinnings of the in vivo metastatic microenvironment. This need for understanding is enhanced in pediatric patients, where metastasis is promoted by access to a large pool of undifferentiated cells. This project addresses this critical issue in Ewing sarcoma, a cancer that codifies the challenges and shortcomings of current cancer therapeutics. Ewing sarcoma is a malignant cancer of bone and soft tissue targeting children, adolescents and young adults. Overall survival rates for Ewing sarcoma patients with metastasis is abysmal at less than 20% for those with advanced disease and at 60% for those with localized tumors. One in three patients with Ewing sarcoma will have presentation of metastasis. These metrics demonstrate the desperate need to further understand the genesis of metastasis in vivo. This proposal focuses in on the role of the transcription factor SOX6 and its role in Ewing sarcoma metastasis. My preliminary zebrafish xenograft data show a clear, marked increase in metastasis with normal levels of SOX6, while SOX6 shRNA knockdown cells have less or no metastatic spread from injection site. My SOX6 knockdown proteome data show suppression of CAV1, a known gene targeting E-cadherin expression in Ewing sarcoma and increase of BCL2A1, an established anti-apoptotic protein involved in numerous cancer cells. This project’s central hypothesis is: 1) SOX6 mediated protein changes cause an increase in motility and decrease in apoptosis leading to metastasis and 2) that upon metastasis, interaction with the microenvironmental niche triggers invasive proliferative phenotypes mediated by downstream targets of SOX6. These SOX6-mdediated phenotype and proteomic changes support a story of in vivo initiation and persistence of metastatic lesions in Ewing sarcoma. This proposal is the first to look at the intersection of the cell microenvironment with SOX6 to show a new pathway for advancing momentum to targeted treatment of metastasis. Using my unique background in engineering and my training in cell biology, I propose a method that remediates key failures of current treatment by understanding the initiation of metastasis in vivo, persistence of cancer cells, and microenvironmental effects fostering metastasis. This proposal unites many disciplines to offer scientific impact on the genesis of metastasis and provides an incredible opportunity to train my skills as a future independent investigator. Project Narrative: Many metastatic models of cancer fail to account for the complexity of the tumor microenvironment at the metastatic niche, and the zebrafish provides a readily imageable model to analyze human cancer metastasis using machine learning. This project looks at the in vivo role of the transcription factor SOX6 in metastatic progression of Ewing sarcoma through cell proliferation, motility change, and apoptosis suppression.

"Hybrid virtual-MRI/CBCT: A new paradigm for image guidance in liver SBRT ABSTRACT This proposal aims to establish a hybrid virtual-MRI/CBCT system for precision image guidance in radiation therapy of liver cancer. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) improves the treatment outcome over conventional fractionated radiotherapy by delivering high fractional dose in few fractions. However, SBRT of liver cancer still has high local failure rate up to 20-30% at 2-3 years and high overall grade>=3 toxicity rate up to 30% with patient deaths from the treatment. Previous studies demonstrated a strong correlation between the treatment outcome and the tumor localization accuracy of the image guidance technique used. Currently, cone beam CT (CBCT) is the most widely used imaging technique for liver SBRT. However, CBCT has extremely limited soft tissue contrast with no visualization of most liver tumors. As a result, its localization error is frequently over 6mm, and the dose coverage of tumor volume can fall below 90%, which is far from enough for tumor control. Drastically reducing localization errors is imperative to improve the outcome of liver SBRT. Combined MRI-Radiotherapy machines could provide MRI contrast for liver tumor localization. However, such machines are rare and expensive for most clinics. As such, an alternative solution is urgently required to meet the ubiquitous need of all radiation oncology departments: a solution in the form of a novel low-cost imaging system with MRI equivalent contrast. Since CBCT is readily available on most radiotherapy machines, creating CBCT-based imaging systems would be the most effective strategy. Our recent publication demonstrated the feasibility of such strategy. (Harris, Med Phys 2018) Our long-term goal is to establish the next generation of CBCT systems with virtual multi-modality imaging capabilities for high precision tumor localization and adaptive therapy in radiation therapy. In this application, our overall objective is to establish a novel system to generate hybrid virtual-MRI/CBCT from CBCT, with virtual-MRI inside the liver for target localization and augmented CBCT outside the liver for healthy tissue verification. The specific aims are: (1). Establish a 3D hybrid virtual- MRI/CBCT system for image guidance in breath-hold liver SBRT without respiratory motion. (2). Establish a 4D hybrid virtual-MRI/CBCT system for image guidance in free-breathing liver SBRT with respiratory motion. (3). Optimize and clinically evaluate the systems through simulation studies and a prospective clinical trial. Our expected deliverables through the academic-industrial partnership are novel hybrid virtual-MRI/CBCT systems ready to be integrated to all radiotherapy machines with only CBCT systems. This new imaging capability will have significant clinical impact because it will create a paradigm shift in image-guided radiation therapy by revolutionizing the widely used CBCT systems to enable a new era of low-cost high-precision virtual multi- modality guided radiotherapy. This precision guidance can lead to breakthrough in escalating the tumor control and minimizing the toxicities of liver SBRT as well as treatments of other sites with tumors in the soft tissue. Project Narrative The hybrid virtual-MRI/CBCT system will be a low-cost imaging system with superb soft tissue contrast to provide precise image guidance for liver SBRT, which paves the road to further margin reduction and dose escalation. As a result, this novel system has a great potential to enhance the tumor local control and reduce the normal tissue toxicities for all patients under liver SBRT treatments. Finally yet importantly, the hybrid virtual-MRI/CBCT system can also be potentially applicable for improving the image guidance precision of radiation therapy treatments of other clinical sites with tumors in the soft tissue, such as breast and prostate cancers.",Hybrid virtual-MRI/CBCT: A new paradigm for image guidance in liver SBRT,10021659,R01EB028324,"['Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Breathing ', ' Respiratory Aspiration ', ' Respiratory Inspiration ', ' inspiration ', ' Atlases ', ' Award ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Elements ', ' Goals ', ' Hybrids ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic body system ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' Liver neoplasms ', ' Hepatic Neoplasms ', ' hepatic neoplasia ', ' hepatic neoplasm ', ' hepatic tumor ', ' liver tumor ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Motion ', ' Patients ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publishing ', ' Radiation therapy ', ' Radiotherapeutics ', ' Radiotherapy ', ' radiation treatment ', ' radio-therapy ', ' treatment with radiation ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Psychological Transfer ', ' learning transfer ', ' training transfer ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' falls ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Surface ', ' Clinical ', ' Residual ', ' Residual state ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Ensure ', ' Compensation ', ' Financial compensation ', ' soft tissue ', ' Failure ', ' Hepatotoxic effect ', ' Liver Toxicity ', ' Toxic effect on liver cells ', ' hepatic toxicity ', ' hepatoxicity ', ' Hepatotoxicity ', ' Radiation Oncology ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' Oncology ', ' Normal Tissue ', ' Normal tissue morphology ', ' Hepatic Cancer ', ' liver cancer ', ' malignant liver tumor ', ' Malignant neoplasm of liver ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Clinic ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Tumor Volume ', ' respiratory ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' multi-modal imaging ', ' multi-modality imaging ', ' multimodality imaging ', ' Multimodal Imaging ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' cone-beam CT ', ' volume CT ', ' volume computed tomography ', ' volumetric computed tomography ', ' cone-beam computed tomography ', ' cost ', ' virtual ', ' next generation ', ' clinical site ', ' clinical research site ', ' prospective ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinically significant ', ' tumor ', ' multi-modality ', ' multimodality ', ' industrial partnership ', ' industry partnership ', ' industry partner ', ' clinical practice ', ' IGRT ', ' image guided radiation treatment ', ' image-guided radiotherapy ', ' image guided radiation therapy ', ' image guidance ', ' image guided ', ' Fractionated radiotherapy ', ' imaging system ', ' improved outcome ', ' imaging capabilities ', ' recursive neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' random forest ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' Visualization ', ' ']",NIBIB,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,496097,NC-04,0.06766836828673355
"(PQ2) PD-L1/PD-1 signals in aged hosts undergoing cancer immunotherapy This proposal combines a team with expertise in aging, tumor immunology, tumor immunotherapy, specific genetically modified animal models and early phase clinical trials with a computational team having great expertise in analyzing and modeling aging of the immune system. We will study age effects on PD-L1/PD-1 signaling in the host and the tumor focusing on melanoma with some bladder cancer work, two tumors that are highly responsive to αPD-1 and/or αPD-L1 as proofs-of-concept, and residing in distinct anatomic compartments. In Aim 1 we study tumor PD-L1 intrinsic effects on αPD-L1 and αPD-1 treatment in melanoma and bladder cancer using transplantable B16 and inducible Nras/Cdk2n melanoma models, and transplantable MB49 and BBN-induced tumors for bladder cancer studies. We also use novel melanoma and BC models with tumor cell- specific PD-L1KO. We study 3 cohorts of elderly versus younger humans getting αPD-L1 or αPD-1 for melanoma or bladder cancer for human validation. We measure high-dimensional cell phenotypes and signaling responses, proteins and genes to maximize the information collected from human samples and mice using 23-color FACS, CyTOF, Luminex, Nanostring and other approaches. In Aim 2 we use all the above models and analytic strategies in young and aged PD-L1KO mice and WT or bone marrow chimeras to test hematopoietic and non- hematopoietic (host) PD-L1 signals in treatment outcomes in melanoma and bladder cancer. In Aim 3 the Systems Immunology team will use their innovative and successful computational modeling to identify age- related co-predictors of immunotherapy response and to identify candidate mechanisms for responders and non- responders. We will define a trajectory of immune system aging in mice at ultra-high resolution by performing a systems level integrative analysis of aging in Collaborative Cross and BL6 mice tracked in a combined longitudinal and cross-sectional study. This trajectory will be used to understand how tumor response and treatment outcomes vary as a function of age, and to build a simple, low parameter (i.e., easily testable and clinically translated), predictive models of treatment response. We will test insights by analyzing immune data from aged versus young patients undergoing αPD-L1 and αPD-1 cancer immunotherapy in novel machine learning approaches that we pioneered to identify insights from mouse data that are relevant to humans. Coupling this disease information with the healthy human aging trajectory that we recently defined will allow us to adapt our mouse data to predict optimal treatments in humans based on chronological and immune aging. This combined trans-disciplinary approach will identify common age-related disabilities that reduce PD-L1/PD-1 based immunotherapy responses and suggest tailored treatments for optimal efficacy that could later be tested in validation sets. These data can also be applied to other types of immunotherapy as we will also test. Cancer is a disease of the aged, but therapies are generally modeled in the young. We study age effects on cancer immunotherapy in response to PQ2 to develop ways to optimize cancer immunotherapy in aged patients most at risk. We focus on the PD-L1/PD-1 axis that is the cornerstone of the most successful cancer immunotherapies to date.",(PQ2) PD-L1/PD-1 signals in aged hosts undergoing cancer

"Antigen-independent prediction and biomarker identification of cancer-specific T cells Project Summary/Abstract Cancer immunotherapy has achieved remarkable clinical success treating late-stage tumors, yet the response rates remain low and the side effects are often severe. Designing effective immunotherapies relies on accurate identification of tumor-reactive T cells. This is an extremely difficult task because 1) most of the cancer antigens are unknown; 2) the majority of the tumor-infiltrating T cells (TIL) does not recognize cancer cells; and 3) without known antigens, the only approach to acquire such T cells is to perform ex vivo expansion of TILs stimulated by autologous cancer cells, which generates non-specific T cells and is infeasible to many patients. Nonetheless, this strategy is widely adopted in current clinical trials for anti-cancer treatment, despite its reduced therapeutic efficacy and unpredictable side effects of autoimmunity. Therefore, unbiased, antigen- independent identification of tumor-reactive T cells, if possible, will be a major clinical priority as it will significantly increase the efficiency and safety of T cell based immunotherapies. Here we propose to achieve this goal through the development of novel machine learning methods. Such approach has not yet been explored because the fundamental difference between cancer and non-cancer T cells lies in their receptor sequences (TCR), and training data of cancer-specific TCRs is currently unavailable. To prepare for this task, we have developed the software TRUST, to extract the T cell antigen-binding CDR3 regions from bulk tumor RNA-seq data, and the software iSMART to group these CDR3s into antigen-specific clusters. These tools allowed us to develop a new rationale for producing large training sets of tumor-reactive TCRs, even without knowing cancer antigens. In our preliminary analysis, we observed that TCRs from the training data can be matched to tumor antigens that bind to HLA-A*02:01 and elicit immune response in vivo. The cancer-specific CDR3 amino acid sequences also show significantly different biochemical features from non-cancer ones, based on which we further developed software DeepCAT to demonstrate the feasibility of de novo prediction of cancer TCRs. These exciting results highlighted the importance to develop better computational method to track the tumor-reactive T cells for clinical applications. Accordingly, we propose the following Specific Aims: In Aim 1, we will deliver a new machine learning method for accurate classification of tumor-reactive T cells using the CDR3 sequences. In Aim 2, we will derive a set of biomarkers for the cancer-specific T cells for fast and accurate flow sorting of these T cells from TILs. In Aim 3, we will perform single cell sequencing and functional validation of cancer-specific T cells using humanized animal model to validate the predicted genes, and to produce a prioritized list of promising targets for cancer diagnosis, prognosis and therapy development. These Aims will be accomplished with the great support from the excellent collaborators specialized in cancer immunology at UTSW. Successful completion of this proposal will provide an exciting new paradigm to identify tumor-reactive T cells for precision cancer immunotherapies. Project Narrative Identification of tumor-specific T cells is critical to immunotherapy development, yet remains a challenging task. In this project we will develop a novel machine learning method to study: 1) which T cells in the tumor microenvironment are reactive to malignant cells; 2) what signature genes can be used to track the cancer- specific T cells.
