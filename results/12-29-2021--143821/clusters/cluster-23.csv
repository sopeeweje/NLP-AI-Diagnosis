"Longitudinal validity of accelerometry in youth    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since the inception of parent grant (July 2007), pattern recognition approaches such as neural networks, decision trees, Bayesian classifiers, and hidden Markov models have emerged as a viable and potentially more accurate alternative to traditional regression based cut-point methods. Whereas cut-point methods have proven to be modestly useful for broadly classifying the absolute intensity of physical activity, preliminary findings from the parent grant suggest that regression-based cut-point methods lack the accuracy required to provide valid point estimates of total and physical activity energy expenditure in field-based studies. Recently, pattern recognition approaches have been shown to be feasible and accurate using count data collected in 1-second increments by the widely used Actigraph accelerometer. The overarching goal of this competitive revision is to apply novel pattern recognition or machine learning data processing techniques to estimate physical activity type and intensity from high resolution accelerometer count data collected in children and adolescents as part of the ongoing parent grant. The proposed new aims are as follows: 1) To formulate and apply pattern recognition data processing techniques (multivariate hidden Markov models) to predict physical activity type and intensity from 1-second accelerometer count data collected in an age-diverse cohort children and adolescent; and 2) to compare the accuracy of physical activity intensity predictions provided by pattern recognition data processing techniques and traditional regression-based cut-point methods at baseline, and after 12-, 24-, and 36-months of follow-up.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The results of the proposed study will enable researchers to more effectively reduce and interpret accelerometer data collected in longitudinal studies of youth as well as population- based studies involving age diverse samples of children and adolescents. Moreover, the new aims will inform the development of new computational approaches for predicting physical activity energy expenditure in free-living children and adolescents. This development will be particularly important for observational and experimental studies wishing to investigate the contributions of physical activity and sedentary behavior in the development and maintenance of childhood obesity.                Relevance to Public Health The results of the proposed study will enable researchers to more effectively reduce and interpret accelerometer data collected in longitudinal studies of youth as well as population- based studies involving age diverse samples of children and adolescents.

"Development and Use of rtfMRI for Self-control of Nicotine Craving    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This application aims to study the application of functional magnetic resonance imaging in real time (rtfMRI) as an operant training feedback mechanism for treating substance use disorders. Recent data suggest that individuals can reduce activity in some brain regions (e.g. anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula, auditory cortex when they are presented with information about activation in that brain region. Experimental and clinical pain have been reduced with rtfMRI signal feedback from the rostral anterior cingulate in a manner proportional to reductions in the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal from that region. These regions overlap with those involved in the effects of substances of abuse and the development of substance use disorders (SUDs). The initial information opens the possibility of applying neurofeedback to improve treatment outcomes in patient samples. The present application seeks to expand the investigation of these processes and validate their applicability to substance dependent volunteers. In initial studies we will examine the capacity of nicotine dependent volunteers to reduce their craving for cigarettes. This substance was selected for its high retention rates and prevalence and public health burden in the general population, but it is expected that future studies would explore other forms of addiction (e.g. cocaine, opiates). Our multidisciplinary team proposes to advance current knowledge in this area by: (1) using data not from a single brain region, but from networks involved in nicotine craving and dependence, thereby accounting for inter- individual differences in brain regional activation patterns during nicotine craving; (2) developing a quantifiable method by using arterial spin labeling (ASL); and (3) determining the influence of individual expectations on these processes (e.g. assessing the degree to which these effects are attributable to placebo-related responding).

"Preventing Drug Abuse among Hispanic Adolescents    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This resubmitted application addresses the weaknesses identified in its initial review. Prepared in response to PAS-09-001, Drug Abuse Epidemiology and Services Research in Cooperation with the Clinical and Translational Science Awards Consortium (R01), the application lays plans to develop, test, and disseminate an interactive program to delay the onset of drug use and to prevent harmful use and abuse among Hispanic youths. Study participants will come from Northern Manhattan, home to a large population of Hispanic families from Dominican, Puerto Rican, and other backgrounds. Grounded in bicultural competence and social learning theories, the prevention program will equip youths with cognitive and behavioral skills to address ethnic-specific and pan-ethnic risk and protective factors associated with drug use among Hispanic adolescents. Youths will access the program's 10 initial sessions and annual booster sessions via personal computer. Through a human simulation interaction platform, the program will employ artificial intelligence, graphic portrayals of emotional states, and a branched learning environment in which youths can acquire, try out, receive feedback on, and master new interpersonal skills. Cultural content woven into every programmatic session, together with sessions expressly dedicated to issues of acculturation, Hispanic traditions, and bicultural stress will give the program thematic coherence and enhance its attraction and value. The study design is a randomized clinical trial. Enrolled 11-, 12-, and 13-year-old youths will complete baseline measures, intervention-arm youths will receive the initial prevention program, and all youths will complete post-intervention and 12-, 24-, and 36-month follow-up measures. Intervention-arm youths will additionally receive pairs of booster sessions after they complete 12- and 24-month follow-up measurements. Hypothesis testing analyses will examine 30-day drug use rates between arms and across follow-up measurement occasions. In addition, we will analyze intervention effects on mediator variables associated with drug use risk and protective factors. We also will assess the extent to which changes on mediator variables explain drug use differences. And, we will examine gender differences, and, to the extent possible, immigration status and ethnic background differences in study outcomes. At the conclusion of the trial, and assuming that longitudinal findings support the tested prevention approach, we will revise the program to increase its appeal for Hispanic youth across America, and we will disseminate the revised program through a variety of online resources. Throughout, we will monitor program dissemination.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will longitudinally test a computerized drug abuse prevention program for Hispanic adolescents. The culturally-tailored prevention program aims to strengthen and sustain protective factors while equipping youths with the necessary information and skills to reduce risk factors associated with cigarettes, alcohol, marijuana, and other harmful drug use.           This study will longitudinally test a computerized drug abuse prevention program for Hispanic adolescents.

"Neural Network Predictors of Treatment Outcome Among Adolescent Assault Victims     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal for a NIMH Exploratory/Developmental Grant Award (R21) seeks to identify neural functional connectivity patterns associated with response to Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT) among female adolescent assault victims. Adolescent assault exposure is a potent risk factor for persistent psychopathology, most notably PTSD. TF-CBT is the only treatment for adolescent PTSD victims with strong empirical support, yet response to TF-CBT is variable and many victims continue to exhibit clinically significant symptoms following treatment. The overall goal of this proposal is to use computational neuroscience tools to predict and understand treatment response among this vulnerable population. Based on human neuroimaging studies demonstrating altered activity and connectivity within neural networks mediating emotion reactivity and emotion regulation among PTSD victims, we hypothesize that patterns of functional connectivity within these neural networks can be used to predict and understand response to TF-CBT among adolescent assault victims. 45 adolescent assault victims aged 11-16 will be provided with a 12-week course of TF-CBT. Participants will undergo fMRI scanning while engaged in emotion reactivity and emotion regulation tasks before and after treatment. A combination of graph theory analyses and support vector classification and regression will be used to identify pre-treatment patterns of functional connectivity that predict subsequent response to TF-CBT (Aim 1). Graph theory analyses will similarly be used to identify changes in network organization from pre-to-post-treatment associated with successful (Aim 2) and unsuccessful (Aim 3) treatment response. This analytic approach to the clinical problem of understanding the variable response to TF-CBT will foster concrete algorithms to be used by a clinician to predict a child's treatment response, which is the first step towards personalizing treatments for this vulnerable population. Further, this analytic approach will identify the essential neural mechanism mediating treatment response and provide targets for the development of novel treatment components. This application proposes a novel approach towards understanding treatment response among a vulnerable adolescent population and will hopefully facilitate the development of more consistent interventions to ameliorate the high cost associated with adolescent assault exposure.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal investigates neural network predictors of treatment outcome among assaulted adolescent girls. This research will lead to a better understanding of how treatment works and why some children do not respond to treatment.              This proposal investigates neural network predictors of treatment outcome among assaulted adolescent girls.

The overall goal of this proposal is to use computational neuroscience tools to predict and understand treatment response among this vulnerable population. Based on human neuroimaging studies demonstrating altered activity and connectivity within neural networks mediating emotion reactivity and emotion regulation among PTSD victims, we hypothesize that patterns of functional connectivity within these neural networks can be used to predict and understand response to TF-CBT among adolescent assault victims. 45 adolescent assault victims aged 11-16 will be provided with a 12-week course of TF-CBT. Participants will undergo fMRI scanning while engaged in emotion reactivity and emotion regulation tasks before and after treatment. A combination of graph theory analyses and support vector classification and regression will be used to identify pre-treatment patterns of functional connectivity that predict subsequent response to TF-CBT (Aim 1). Graph theory analyses will similarly be used to identify changes in network organization from pre-to-post-treatment associated with successful (Aim 2) and unsuccessful (Aim 3) treatment response. This analytic approach to the clinical problem of understanding the variable response to TF-CBT will foster concrete algorithms to be used by a clinician to predict a child's treatment response, which is the first step towards personalizing treatments for this vulnerable population. Further, this analytic approach will identify the essential neural mechanism mediating treatment response and provide targets for the development of novel treatment components. This application proposes a novel approach towards understanding treatment response among a vulnerable adolescent population and will hopefully facilitate the development of more consistent interventions to ameliorate the high cost associated with adolescent assault exposure.          This proposal investigates neural network predictors of treatment outcome among assaulted adolescent girls. This research will lead to a better understanding of how treatment works and why some children do not respond to treatment.

"Pegasys VR: Integrating Virtual Humans in the Treatment of Child Social Anxiety     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Anxiety disorders are the most common psychiatric disorders among youth, with lifetime prevalence ranging between 18-20% of the general population. Among anxiety disorders, social anxiety disorder (SAD) affects 8% of all youth, resulting in significant short and long-term impairment, including increased likelihood of substance abuse, limited academic achievement, attenuated occupational functioning, and impaired or missing social relationships. Emerging data suggest that interventions that include social skills training, formal peer generalization sessions, and homework assignments as part of an overall treatment strategy show enhanced efficacy when compared to interventions without these components - the latter two elements which are designed to enhance skill generalization. Two critical treatment elements (peer generalization, homework assignments) are difficult to implement in traditional clinical settings, limiting optimal dissemination to youth in need of thes services in different settings (e.g., at school, outpatient, or community facilities). In our recenly completed Phase I STTR, we developed and validated an interactive virtual environment (VE) to solve the need for intensive behavioral practice opportunities that are critical for skill generalization. Our VE, known as Pegasys-VR"", allowed intensive practice of social skills without the need for formal peer group activities (in-clinic solution) or intensive parental involvement (at-home solution). Our results indicated that implementing a VE environment into the SET-C program was accessible, credible and feasible for the parents, clinicians and children who participated in the trial. Furthermore, examination of within group changes indicated statistically significant improvement in SAD symptoms. Given the success of the Phase I, and the need to increase the automation of the system to increase its acceptance and adoption among clinicians and socially anxiety youth, our Phase II STTR study will have the following goals: incorporate an artificial intelligence natural language system, develop additional VEs for in-clinic practice, expand the homework solution to provide additional opportunities to reinforce skills acquisition and generalization practice in in-vivo settings, using serious game theory and technology, and conduct a randomized controlled trial with youth ages 7 to 12 to test whether Pegasys-VR"" is as effective as traditional behavioral interventions for youth with social anxiety disorder and if the effects are maintained at 3 month follow-up. If Pegasys-VR"" is clinically efficacious, it would offer a sustainable, cost-effective intervention that can be easily and rapidy disseminated.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Among children, social anxiety is a common, severe and chronic disorder. Social Effectiveness Therapy for Children (SET-C) is an empirically supported treatment with significant potential to impact the lives of children with this severe and chronic disorder. The proposed Pegasys-VR"" system will distinctly enhance its utility, as it will allow dissemination to a broad variety of clinical settings including schools as well as traditional outpatient clinics. Its use for the treatment of social skills deficits will offer a superior soluton for mental health personnel, solving many of the resource and logistic barriers that they currently face. The final product will address cost and practical issues by disseminating an empirically-supported treatment that was rigorously built and tested. Using VE will make the traditional social skills therapy programs program cost-effective and patient-centric, allowing even clinicians with little background/training in behavior therapy to have tools not typically availabl to them.            ",Pegasys VR: Integrating Virtual Humans in the Treatment of Child Social Anxiety,8780982,R42MH094019,"['Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' Aftercare ', ' Age ', ' Outpatient Clinics ', ' Ambulatory Care Facilities ', ' Anxiety ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Automation ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Communities ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' N-Methyl-gamma-(4-(trifluoromethyl)phenoxy)benzenepropanamine ', ' Fluoxetin ', ' Fluoxetine ', ' Game Theory ', ' Goals ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Out-patients ', ' Outpatients ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Peer Group ', ' sham therapy ', ' Sham Treatment ', ' Placebos ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Schools ', ' Solutions ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Social Impacts ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Training ', ' Logistics ', ' satisfaction ', ' relaxation training ', ' Relaxation Therapy ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Reliance ', ' Exposure to ', ' Attenuated ', ' tool ', ' programs ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Clinic ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Occupational ', ' Outcome Study ', ' Services ', ' skills training ', ' mental health personnel ', ' success ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' social competency ', ' social competence ', ' interpersonal competency ', ' interpersonal competence ', ' social skills ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Academic achievement ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Pill ', ' pill (pharmacologic) ', ' Pegasys ', ' Roche brand of peginterferon alfa-2a ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' in vivo ', ' Cognitive ', ' Community Practice ', ' STTR ', ' Small Business Technology Transfer Research ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' virtual ', ' virtual human ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' Impairment ', ' skill acquisition ', ' parental involvement ', ' usability ', ' public health relevance ', ' community setting ', ' effective intervention ', ' treatment strategy ', ' natural language ', ' ']",NIMH,"VIRTUALLY BETTER, INC.",R42,2014,693414,GA-04,0.031195772600987503
"Impulsivity as Immaturity: Mapping Dysmaturation of the Brain's Control Architecture in Youth Externalizing Psychopathology ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Youth with externalizing psychopathologies, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and conduct disorder, present with diverse kinds of impulsivity symptoms, which in turn reflect deficits in regulatory control functioning. An emerging neurodevelopmental model, which we call the Impulsivity as Immaturity Model, could potentially transform our understanding of the brain basis of regulatory dysfunction. The brain's regulatory control architecture (RCA) undergoes massive maturation during childhood and adolescence. The Impulsivity as Immaturity Model proposes that aberrant maturation in distinct components of the RCA gives rise to distinct patterns of impulsivity symptoms-e.g., delayed maturation in certain attention control components gives rise to attentional variability, a specific form of attention dysfunction. Informed by this model, we will use a mixed cohort/longitudinal design enrolling 135 healthy youth and 135 youth with externalizing psychopathologies. Using advanced multivariate/multimodal analytic methods, we will map the normative neurodevelopmental trajectories of major components of the RCA including components involved in attention, motor, emotion, and appetitive control. We will then construct multivariate models that predict different forms of impulsivity based on neurodevelopment patterns of RCA components. Successful completion of this project will be a critical first step in development of a new class of imaging-based immaturity biomarkers that index distinct types of impulsivity irrespective of the specific externalizing disorders in which they manifest. This will lead to earlier, more reliable diagnosis of impulsivity problems in youth and spur the development of transdiagnostic, biologically based interventions that target specific forms of RCA dysmaturation.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Using neuroimaging, we will map the development of key components of the brain's regulatory control architecture in a sample of youth with externalizing disorders and diverse kinds of impulsivity symptoms. We will use these maps to develop a new class of neuroimaging biomarkers for specific forms of impulsivity. This research will advance the development of biologically informed dimensional approaches for characterizing complex impulsivity phenotypes and will spur the development of new treatments.                ",Impulsivity as Immaturity: Mapping Dysmaturation of the Brain's Control Architecture in Youth Externalizing Psychopathology,8956794,R01MH107741,"['teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Architecture ', ' Attention ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Emotions ', ' indexing ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Michigan ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.) ', ' Oppositional Defiant Disorder ', ' Phenotype ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Rewards ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' disorders of conduct ', ' disorder of conduct ', ' Conduct Disorder ', ' base ', ' Link ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Motor Hyperactivity ', ' Hyperkinetic Movements ', ' Hyperkinesis ', ' Hyperkinesia ', ' Hyperactivity ', ' Hyperactive behavior ', ' Investigation ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' brain control ', ' mind control ', ' cohort ', ' Neural Development ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' neuroimaging ', ' Participant ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' nosology ', ' disorder classification ', ' disease classification ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Hyperactivity Disorder NOS ', ' ADHD ', ' AD/HD ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' Symptoms ', ' Base of the Brain ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' vector ', ' Advanced Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' independent component analysis ', ' neuropsychological ', ' public health relevance ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' early adolescence ', ' longitudinal design ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2015,382086,MI-12,0.05788577218443883
"ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period associated with dramatic increases in rates of substance use. Identifying the pathways to substance use and its effects on child and adolescent development is critically important, as the effects of substance use during ongoing maturation likely have long-lasting effects on brain functioning and behavioral, health, and psychological outcomes. This Research Project Site application from the University of California, San Diego and Laureate Institute for Brain Research is in response to RFA-DA-15-015 as part of the ABCD-USA Consortium (5/13), to prospectively determine the neurodevelopmental and behavioral predictors and consequences of substance use on children and adolescents. A representative community sample of 1086 9-10 year olds enriched for high- risk characteristics will be recruited, contributing to the sample f 11,111 to be collected from 11 hubs across the ABCD- USA Consortium. All participants will undergo a comprehensive baseline assessment, including state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, bioassays, mobile monitoring and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning every 2 years. Interim annual interviews and quarterly web-based assessments will provide refined temporal resolution of behaviors, development, and life events with minimal participant burden. These Consortium-wide data obtained during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects of substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the ""gateway interactions"" between use of different substances. This hub's Research Project focuses on mechanisms of substance use disorder, special populations with high use prevalence, and the use of drugs other than marijuana. (1) We will determine whether individual differences in neural processing of antireward (i.e., negative reinforcement mechanisms) in amygdala, insula, and anterior cingulate are associated with increased negative emotionality and pain, predict initiation of use and problem use, and are in turn further dysregulated by substance use. (2) We will determine whether protective environment factors and ethnic identification in minority youth are linked to healthier antireward processing and better substance use outcomes. (3) We will determine whether antireward neural processing predicts increased use of illicit drugs other than MJ including misuse of prescription drugs, if such use predicts subsequent exaggerated antireward processing, and if gateway interactions exist between substances.

"ABCD-USA Consortium:Research Project ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period that is associated with dramatic increases in rates of substance use. Identifying predictors of substance use and its effects on child and adolescent development is critically important, as substance-related decrements incurred during ongoing maturation could have long- lasting effects on brain functioning and behavioral, health, and psychological outcomes. In response to RFA- DA-15-015, this application proposes the University of Pittsburgh Research Project Site component [12/13] of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD)-USA consortium to prospectively determine the neurodevelopmental and behavioral effects of substance on children and adolescents. In Pittsburgh, a representative community sample of 550 9-10 year old substance-naïve children will be recruited (total ABCD- USA n=11,111 from 11 total sites) and will undergo a baseline assessment and two to three follow-ups over a five year period. At each assessment period, participants will undergo state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, and extensive assessment of substance use patterns and mental health functioning. The brain, behavioral, psychological, social, genetic, and environmental data collected during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects o substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the ""gateway interactions"" between use of different substances. Elements Unique to This Site: In addition, ABCD-USA Pittsburgh will provide a unique focus determining how the cognitive dimensions of working memory and inhibitory control and the maturation of corticostriatal systems can inform our understanding of the risks for and effects of early adolescent marijuana use. Working memory and inhibitory control improve during adolescence in parallel with maturation of underlying corticostriatal neurocircuitry. An understanding of these areas of adolescent brain and cognitive development provide critical information in models determining vulnerabilities for and consequences of marijuana and other substance use. In Y03, Pittsburgh will focus on analyses examining working memory and inhibitory control phenotypes and neurodevelopmental characteristics prior to substance use. In Y04-Y05, these neurocognitive characteristics will be examined as risks for early adolescent marijuana use trajectories and, in Y10, accelerated adolescent marijuana use trajectories. Machine Learning will be applied to integrating cognitive and neuroimaging features to characterize a model of risks for early adolescent marijuana use.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ABCD-USA Consortium will use multimodal brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, mobile monitoring, and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning in 11,111 adolescents followed over 10 years to determine the effects of substance use on adolescent brain and cognitive development.

"Preventing Drug Abuse among Hispanic Adolescents DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This resubmitted application addresses the weaknesses identified in its initial review. Prepared in response to PAS-09-001, Drug Abuse Epidemiology and Services Research in Cooperation with the Clinical and Translational Science Awards Consortium (R01), the application lays plans to develop, test, and disseminate an interactive program to delay the onset of drug use and to prevent harmful use and abuse among Hispanic youths. Study participants will come from Northern Manhattan, home to a large population of Hispanic families from Dominican, Puerto Rican, and other backgrounds. Grounded in bicultural competence and social learning theories, the prevention program will equip youths with cognitive and behavioral skills to address ethnic-specific and pan-ethnic risk and protective factors associated with drug use among Hispanic adolescents. Youths will access the program's 10 initial sessions and annual booster sessions via personal computer. Through a human simulation interaction platform, the program will employ artificial intelligence, graphic portrayals of emotional states, and a branched learning environment in which youths can acquire, try out, receive feedback on, and master new interpersonal skills. Cultural content woven into every programmatic session, together with sessions expressly dedicated to issues of acculturation, Hispanic traditions, and bicultural stress will give the program thematic coherence and enhance its attraction and value. The study design is a randomized clinical trial. Enrolled 11-, 12-, and 13-year-old youths will complete baseline measures, intervention-arm youths will receive the initial prevention program, and all youths will complete post-intervention and 12-, 24-, and 36-month follow-up measures. Intervention-arm youths will additionally receive pairs of booster sessions after they complete 12- and 24-month follow-up measurements. Hypothesis testing analyses will examine 30-day drug use rates between arms and across follow-up measurement occasions. In addition, we will analyze intervention effects on mediator variables associated with drug use risk and protective factors. We also will assess the extent to which changes on mediator variables explain drug use differences. And, we will examine gender differences, and, to the extent possible, immigration status and ethnic background differences in study outcomes. At the conclusion of the trial, and assuming that longitudinal findings support the tested prevention approach, we will revise the program to increase its appeal for Hispanic youth across America, and we will disseminate the revised program through a variety of online resources. Throughout, we will monitor program dissemination. This study will longitudinally test a computerized drug abuse prevention program for Hispanic adolescents. The culturally-tailored prevention program aims to strengthen and sustain protective factors while equipping youths with the necessary information and skills to reduce risk factors associated with cigarettes, alcohol, marijuana, and other harmful drug use.",Preventing Drug Abuse among Hispanic Adolescents,8913924,R01DA031477,"['Cultural Assimilation ', ' Acculturation ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Alcohols ', ' Americas ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Award ', ' Dorsum ', ' Back ', ' Behavior ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Data Collection ', ' abuses drugs ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' Drug abuse ', ' Environment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Family ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Healthcare Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Care Research ', ' Health Services Research ', ' Household ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Immigrations ', ' In-Migration ', ' Institutes ', ' Learning ', ' marijuana ', ' Marihuana ', ' Play ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Schools ', ' Science ', ' sexual dimorphism (noncellular) ', ' gender difference ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Sex Characteristics ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Compact Disk Read-Only Memory ', ' CDROM ', ' CD-ROM (Compact Disc-Read Only Memory) ', ' CD-ROM ', ' Friends ', ' Measures ', ' Competence ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Personal Computers ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Training ', ' school age ', ' School-Age Population ', ' Measurement ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' programs ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Outcome Study ', ' intervention program ', ' Cigarette ', ' Speed ', ' Speed (motion) ', ' skills ', ' simulation ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention program ', ' member ', ' Emotional ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' prevent drug use ', ' prevent drug abuse ', ' drug use prevention ', ' drug addiction prevention ', ' drug abuse prevention ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Dominican ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Cognitive ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Behavioral ', ' post intervention ', ' youth drug use ', ' adolescent drug use ', ' computerized ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' Approaches to prevention ', ' Prevention approach ', ' thirteen year old ', ' age 13 years ', ' 13 year old ', ' eighteen year old ', ' age 18 years ', ' 18 year old ', ' social learning theory ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' high risk ', ' intervention effect ', ' social networking web site ', ' social networking site ', ' social networking website ', ' arm ', ' ']",NIDA,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R01,2015,661707,NY-13,0.09284383705225357
"ABCD-USA Consortium: Data Analysis Center ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ABCD-USA Consortium proposes a study designed to permit the scientific community to answer important questions about the effects of substance use (SU) patterns on behavioral and brain development of adolescents. We have assembled a team of investigators with unparalleled research experience with children and adolescents, and specific expertise in adolescent SU, child and adolescent development, developmental psychopathology, longitudinal multi-site imaging, developmental neuroimaging, developmental cognitive neuroscience, genetics and imaging genetics, bioassays, epidemiology, survey research, bioinformatics, and mobile assessment technologies. We propose a comprehensive, nationwide study to be conducted at 21 sites organized into 11 hubs (over 89 million Americans, 29% of the US population, live within 50 miles of our geographically spread sites), that, uniquely, can provide a nationally representative sample and a large twin sample that together can help distinguish environmental, sociocultural, and genetic factors relevant to SU. We ensure cohesion and standardization by employing a recruitment strategy designed by a professional survey company (experience with Monitoring the Future); standardized environmental, neurocognitive and mental health assessments, MRI assessments with all scanners using harmonized Human Connectome Project procedures, and computerized data collection with real-time quality control. Developmentally tailored assessments will have stable sensitivity and construct validity across the childhood and adolescent developmental period. They minimize participant burden, yet capture even subtle changes over time in substance use, mental health, neurocognition, development, and environment, and we employ novel state-of-the-art bioassays and passive data collection from mobile devices. A detailed retention plan builds on the experience and success of our investigators.

"Pegasys VR: Integrating Virtual Humans in the Treatment of Child Social Anxiety DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Anxiety disorders are the most common psychiatric disorders among youth, with lifetime prevalence ranging between 18-20% of the general population. Among anxiety disorders, social anxiety disorder (SAD) affects 8% of all youth, resulting in significant short and long-term impairment, including increased likelihood of substance abuse, limited academic achievement, attenuated occupational functioning, and impaired or missing social relationships. Emerging data suggest that interventions that include social skills training, formal peer generalization sessions, and homework assignments as part of an overall treatment strategy show enhanced efficacy when compared to interventions without these components - the latter two elements which are designed to enhance skill generalization. Two critical treatment elements (peer generalization, homework assignments) are difficult to implement in traditional clinical settings, limiting optimal dissemination to youth in need of thes services in different settings (e.g., at school, outpatient, or community facilities). In our recenly completed Phase I STTR, we developed and validated an interactive virtual environment (VE) to solve the need for intensive behavioral practice opportunities that are critical for skill generalization. Our VE, known as Pegasys-VR"", allowed intensive practice of social skills without the need for formal peer group activities (in-clinic solution) or intensive parental involvement (at-home solution). Our results indicated that implementing a VE environment into the SET-C program was accessible, credible and feasible for the parents, clinicians and children who participated in the trial. Furthermore, examination of within group changes indicated statistically significant improvement in SAD symptoms. Given the success of the Phase I, and the need to increase the automation of the system to increase its acceptance and adoption among clinicians and socially anxiety youth, our Phase II STTR study will have the following goals: incorporate an artificial intelligence natural language system, develop additional VEs for in-clinic practice, expand the homework solution to provide additional opportunities to reinforce skills acquisition and generalization practice in in-vivo settings, using serious game theory and technology, and conduct a randomized controlled trial with youth ages 7 to 12 to test whether Pegasys-VR"" is as effective as traditional behavioral interventions for youth with social anxiety disorder and if the effects are maintained at 3 month follow-up.

"Automated Ecological Video Identification of Physical Activity (E-VIP) Software ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal addresses multiple priorities of PAR-12-197 ""Improving Diet and Physical Activity (PA) Assessment"" by advancing assessment of population PA in common settings. Physical inactivity is responsible for ≈200,000 deaths in the US and 5 million deaths worldwide annually. About 10% of breast and 10% of colon cancers are attributable to insufficient PA, and inactivity causes 9% of total premature mortality. Parks, schools and youth sports are important contributors of PA that are relevant to a majority of the population. Supporting PA in these settings would contribute to improvements in population levels of PA and disease prevention and control. We will develop a novel video analysis software system, named E-VIP (Ecological Video Identification of PA), which will estimate the number of people and aggregated volume of PA from video recordings of PA- relevant settings. E-VIP will provide automated and continuous (rather than momentary) assessment, which will allow ongoing feedback to inform adaptive interventions and decision making. E-VIP is based on computer science methods used to count crowds and identify behaviors. We will train the E-VIP machine learning algorithm on 32,400 seconds of video from 2 parks, 2 schools, and 2 youth sports settings. Participants will engage in a variety of activities while wearing accelerometers to capture PA intensity in Metabolic Equivalents (METs). The testing phase involves capturing 900, 5-minute videos of free-living behavior across 4 parks, 4 schools, and 4 youth sports settings, with half of the settings/zones being the same as from the training phase. A range of activities and density of people will be captured in both the training and testing phase to maximize coverage of more-difficult high-density situations. Systematic direct observation will be conducted on each time sample to provide the criterion measure for testing validity. The metrics that will be tested include the average number of people, average proportion of people in each activity category (sedentary, light, moderate, vigorous, very vigorous), and sum PA MET-minutes in the setting over the 5-minute (or any given) time period. A gender and age group classifier will be explored. PE classes taught by PE specialists vs classroom teachers will be compared to test construct validity of E-VIP. Bland Altman methods and intraclass correlation coefficients will be used to assess agreement. Potential sources of error such as occlusions (e.g., trees, shadows, other people) will be assessed using moderator analyses. By automating ecological PA assessment, E-VIP will be feasible for widespread use. E-VIP's capability of continuous assessment will improve precision by collecting higher resolution data than collected by existing direct observation tools. When embedded in specific settings through commonly-used security cameras or webcams, or by purposefully placing video recorders, E-VIP will be capable of ongoing assessment which will inform public health surveillance, intervention, and evidence-based decision making (e.g., optimizing intervention strategies, monitoring school Physical Education mandates, providing needs assessment prior to and evaluation after environmental modifications).         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will develop and test a software for automated ongoing measurement of use and physical activity intensity from video recordings in specific settings such as parks, schools (including Physical Education), and youth sports. This innovative software will support adaptive multilevel interventions and evidence-based decision making in physical activity-relevant settings to optimize strategies for improving population health.                ",Automated Ecological Video Identification of Physical Activity (E-VIP) Software,9035822,R21CA194492,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Algorithms ', ' Behavior ', ' Breast ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Crowding ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Decision Making ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Engineering ', ' Exhibits ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Methods ', ' body movement ', ' Movement ', ' Names ', ' Physical Education ', ' Physical Education and Training ', ' Public Health Surveillance ', ' Population Surveillance ', ' Public Health ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Schools ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Sports ', ' Teaching ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Trees ', ' Video Recording ', ' video recording system ', ' Videorecording ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Specialist ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' sedentary ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' teacher ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Premature Mortality ', ' Error Sources ', ' Measurement ', ' Metabolic ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Hour ', ' Complex ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' age group ', ' computer science ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' Agreement ', ' Categories ', ' Colonic Carcinoma ', ' Colon Cancer ', ' Colon Carcinoma ', ' Sampling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' disease control ', ' disorder control ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Sum ', ' Security ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' cost ', ' digital ', ' software systems ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' prototype ', ' public health relevance ', ' population health ', ' Algorithmic Software ', ' Software Algorithm ', ' Algorithmic Tools ', ' physical inactivity ', ' lack of physical activity ', ' Accelerometer ', ' activity tracker ', ' activity monitor ', ' accelerometry ', ' ']",NCI,"CHILDREN'S MERCY HOSP (KANSAS CITY, MO)",R21,2016,199277,MO-05,0.04635933992887933
"Pattern Analysis of fMRI via machine learning/sparse models: application to brain development Abstract Resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) provides reproducible, task-independent biomarkers of coherent functional activity linking different brain regions. The main goal of the proposed project is to leverage advances in signal processing and machine learning methods to derive clinically useful biomarkers based on patterns of functional connectivity, and to test these biomarkers in a large study of brain development. Central to our methodology are 1) computing a subject-specific functional parcellation of the brain, which defines nodes for characterizing individualized functional brain networks; 2) extracting sparse connectivity patterns for robustly representing brain networks; 3) capturing heterogeneity in brain networks across individuals in a given population; and 4) deriving individualized predictive indices of psychosis risk from brain connectivity in a large study of brain development. This novel suite of functional connectivity analysis tools will be developed and validated based on data from the Human Connectome Project and the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC). Finally, these techniques will be applied to PNC data in order to delineate heterogeneity in network development in youth with psychosis-spectrum symptoms. Our hypothesis is that patterns of functional connectivity in adolescents with psychosis-spectrum symptoms will be different from those in typically developing adolescents, and this difference will display a high degree of heterogeneity that is linked to underlying heterogeneity in pathologic neurodevelopmental trajectories. Moreover, we expect that machine learning techniques will allow us to predict on an individual basis which adolescents with psychosis-spectrum symptoms will remain stable, which will revert to normal, and which will progress to psychosis, based on their baseline functional connectivity signatures. Our methods are generally applicable to rsfMRI studies for detecting and quantifying spatio-temporal functional connectivity patterns in diverse fields, including diagnosing brain abnormalities in neuropsychiatric diseases, and finding associations of functional connectivity with different cognitive functions. All methods will be made publicly available and form an important new resource for the broader neuroscience community. Project narrative This proposal develops a suite of advanced functional imaging pattern analysis methods, aiming to delineate heterogeneity in brain network development in youth with psychosis-spectrum symptoms, ultimately leading to early biomarkers of neuropsychiatric disorders. Methodologically, the proposed work leverages upon the strengths of sparse and non-negative decompositions of imaging data, which offer several advantages over conventional mass-univariate and linear multivariate methods. One of the largest and most comprehensive cohorts of 1,600 individuals ages 8 through 21 provides unique imaging and clinical data to support the application of these methods to brain development.",Pattern Analysis of fMRI via machine learning/sparse models: application to brain development,9155330,R01EB022573,"['abstracting ', ' Age ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomy ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Dictionary ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' indexing ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Philadelphia ', ' psychotic illness ', ' Psychoses ', ' Psychotic Disorders ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' cognitive function ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' human data ', ' cohort ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Physiologic Imaging ', ' Functional Imaging ', ' Pattern Recognition ', ' Pathologic ', ' trend ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' signal processing ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' clinical biomarkers ', ' clinically useful biomarkers ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' connectome ', ' brain abnormalities ', ' ']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2016,491014,PA-03,0.029993073657769986
"Pegasys VR: Integrating Virtual Humans in the Treatment of Child Social Anxiety DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Anxiety disorders are the most common psychiatric disorders among youth, with lifetime prevalence ranging between 18-20% of the general population. Among anxiety disorders, social anxiety disorder (SAD) affects 8% of all youth, resulting in significant short and long-term impairment, including increased likelihood of substance abuse, limited academic achievement, attenuated occupational functioning, and impaired or missing social relationships. Emerging data suggest that interventions that include social skills training, formal peer generalization sessions, and homework assignments as part of an overall treatment strategy show enhanced efficacy when compared to interventions without these components - the latter two elements which are designed to enhance skill generalization. Two critical treatment elements (peer generalization, homework assignments) are difficult to implement in traditional clinical settings, limiting optimal dissemination to youth in need of thes services in different settings (e.g., at school, outpatient, or community facilities). In our recenly completed Phase I STTR, we developed and validated an interactive virtual environment (VE) to solve the need for intensive behavioral practice opportunities that are critical for skill generalization. Our VE, known as Pegasys-VR"", allowed intensive practice of social skills without the need for formal peer group activities (in-clinic solution) or intensive parental involvement (at-home solution). Our results indicated that implementing a VE environment into the SET-C program was accessible, credible and feasible for the parents, clinicians and children who participated in the trial. Furthermore, examination of within group changes indicated statistically significant improvement in SAD symptoms. Given the success of the Phase I, and the need to increase the automation of the system to increase its acceptance and adoption among clinicians and socially anxiety youth, our Phase II STTR study will have the following goals: incorporate an artificial intelligence natural language system, develop additional VEs for in-clinic practice, expand the homework solution to provide additional opportunities to reinforce skills acquisition and generalization practice in in-vivo settings, using serious game theory and technology, and conduct a randomized controlled trial with youth ages 7 to 12 to test whether Pegasys-VR"" is as effective as traditional behavioral interventions for youth with social anxiety disorder and if the effects are maintained at 3 month follow-up. If Pegasys-VR"" is clinically efficacious, it would offer a sustainable, cost-effective intervention that can be easily and rapidy disseminated. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Among children, social anxiety is a common, severe and chronic disorder. Social Effectiveness Therapy for Children (SET-C) is an empirically supported treatment with significant potential to impact the lives of children with this severe and chronic disorder. The proposed Pegasys-VR"" system will distinctly enhance its utility, as it will allow dissemination to a broad variety of clinical settings including schools as well as traditional outpatient clinics.

"Impulsivity as Immaturity: Mapping Dysmaturation of the Brain's Control Architecture in Youth Externalizing Psychopathology ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Youth with externalizing psychopathologies, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and conduct disorder, present with diverse kinds of impulsivity symptoms, which in turn reflect deficits in regulatory control functioning. An emerging neurodevelopmental model, which we call the Impulsivity as Immaturity Model, could potentially transform our understanding of the brain basis of regulatory dysfunction. The brain's regulatory control architecture (RCA) undergoes massive maturation during childhood and adolescence. The Impulsivity as Immaturity Model proposes that aberrant maturation in distinct components of the RCA gives rise to distinct patterns of impulsivity symptoms-e.g., delayed maturation in certain attention control components gives rise to attentional variability, a specific form of attention dysfunction. Informed by this model, we will use a mixed cohort/longitudinal design enrolling 135 healthy youth and 135 youth with externalizing psychopathologies. Using advanced multivariate/multimodal analytic methods, we will map the normative neurodevelopmental trajectories of major components of the RCA including components involved in attention, motor, emotion, and appetitive control. We will then construct multivariate models that predict different forms of impulsivity based on neurodevelopment patterns of RCA components. Successful completion of this project will be a critical first step in development of a new class of imaging-based immaturity biomarkers that index distinct types of impulsivity irrespective of the specific externalizing disorders in which they manifest. This will lead to earlier, more reliable diagnosis of impulsivity problems in youth and spur the development of transdiagnostic, biologically based interventions that target specific forms of RCA dysmaturation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Using neuroimaging, we will map the development of key components of the brain's regulatory control architecture in a sample of youth with externalizing disorders and diverse kinds of impulsivity symptoms. We will use these maps to develop a new class of neuroimaging biomarkers for specific forms of impulsivity. This research will advance the development of biologically informed dimensional approaches for characterizing complex impulsivity phenotypes and will spur the development of new treatments.",Impulsivity as Immaturity: Mapping Dysmaturation of the Brain's Control Architecture in Youth Externalizing Psychopathology,9109682,R01MH107741,"['teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Architecture ', ' Attention ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Emotions ', ' Health ', ' indexing ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Michigan ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' Oppositional Defiant Disorder ', ' Phenotype ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Rewards ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Conduct Disorder ', ' disorders of conduct ', ' disorder of conduct ', ' base ', ' Link ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Motor Hyperactivity ', ' Hyperkinetic Movements ', ' Hyperkinesis ', ' Hyperkinesia ', ' Hyperactivity ', ' Hyperactive behavior ', ' Investigation ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' brain control ', ' mind control ', ' cohort ', ' Neural Development ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' Participant ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' nosology ', ' disorder classification ', ' disease classification ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Hyperactivity Disorder NOS ', ' ADHD ', ' AD/HD ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' Symptoms ', ' Base of the Brain ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' vector ', ' Advanced Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' independent component analysis ', ' neuropsychological ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' early adolescence ', ' longitudinal design ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' RDoC ', ' emotion dysregulation ', ' emotional dysregulation ', ' specific biomarkers ', ' connectome ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2016,454953,MI-12,0.05788577218443883
"Course and Outcome of Bipolar Disorder in Youth ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Course and Outcome of Bipolar Disorders in Youth (COBY) study has comprehensively characterized the clinical course of a large sample of youth with bipolar disorder (BD), and has identified demographic and clinical factors that are associated with different illness courses. To date, however, COBY has not included neuroimaging assessments. Including such assessments now will allow, for the first time, an evaluation of the impact of 13-year course of BD and treatment upon neural circuitry function and structure. Furthermore, the majority of COBY participants are currently between 18-30 years old, when the brain, and prefrontal cortex in particular, continues to develop. Including neuroimaging assessments in COBY participants now can thus take advantage of the neurodevelopmental processes occurring between 18-30 years where there are unique opportunities to intervene therapeutically to help normalize abnormalities in neural functioning and structure. Focusing on this age range will also provide a critically important opportunity to determine the extent to which neuroimaging measures predict future clinical course in adulthood. Having normal prefrontal cortical function and structure may predict better clinical course in adulthood, even in COBY participants with poor clinical course in youth, and may lead to decisions to reduce, or even stop, specific treatments in these individuals. In the proposed study, we will determine how previous BD clinical course (e.g., % time with mood symptoms vs. euthymic; % time with comorbid disorders) and treatment exposure from childhood into adulthood impacts neural circuitry functioning and structure supporting key NIMH RDoC information processing domains, and compare neuroimaging findings in COBY participants with those of demographically-matched healthy controls (Aim 1). We will also determine whether neuroimaging measures predict illness course in adulthood, beyond demographic and clinical factors, and previous clinical course in youth (Aim 2). We will use machine learning to explore patterns of wholebrain functioning, white and gray matter structure, and clinical and demographic measures, that most accurately predict future clinical course at the individual subject level. The proposed study also provides a valuable opportunity to inform the field regarding the clinical and functional course and outcome from youth into adulthood in a large, well-characterized sample of people with BD. This is important because the clinical outcome of BD youth in adulthood remains uncertain, as only two studies with a total of 72 subjects followed BD youth into their early twenties. Structural and functional neuroimaging techniques will be employed in a representative subsample of COBY participants (n=120), and healthy controls (n=50). Comprehensive assessments of psychopathology and functioning will be collected at the time of neuroimaging, and twice more during the proposed project period in the 120 COBY participants. This proposal accords with the NIMH's mission to define developmental trajectories of mental disorders and develop strategies to better define risk and protective factors for disease trajectories across the lifespan, and with the RDoC initiative.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The aim of the proposed study is to identify the impact of long-term previous clinical course and treatment on the brain in individuals with childhood-onset bipolar disorder, and examine how these changes in the brain influence future clinical course during adulthood. The participants are currently between 18-30 years old when the brain begins to achieve full maturity. Thus, this study will provide a unique opportunity to determine the extent to which neuroimaging measures predict future clinical course during an important neurodevelopmental period in individuals with bipolar disorder and can yield findings that will aid treatment decisions for these individuals.        ",Course and Outcome of Bipolar Disorder in Youth,9102441,R01MH059929,"['Accounting ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' Anxiety ', ' Arousal ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Future ', ' substantia grisea ', ' gray matter ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hippocampus ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Literature ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Mission ', ' Moods ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' Medial ', ' Clinical ', ' Fiber ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' disorder onset ', ' disease onset ', ' Onset of illness ', ' Exposure to ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' psychosocial ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' Participant ', ' substantia alba ', ' white matter ', ' neural function ', ' Neurophysiology - biologic function ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' Ventral Striatum ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Emotional ', ' Sampling ', ' Symptoms ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' positive emotion ', ' positive emotional state ', ' Outcome ', ' Impact evaluation ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' reward processing ', ' cognitive control ', ' critical period ', ' information processing ', ' public health relevance ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' RDoC ', ' Positive Valence ', ' Negative Valence ', ' symptomatology ', ' mood symptom ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2016,740993,PA-18,0.06677565500068593
"Mechanisms Underlying Differential Effects of Neighborhood Poverty on Problematic Adolescent Drug Use PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Where a child grows up can inﬂuence his or her risk of problematic drug use. Surprisingly, policies and programs designed to improve neighborhood conditions have yielded conﬂicting results in which some children beneﬁt but others are harmed. Understanding the mechanisms by which neighborhoods act to affect problem- atic drug use and how these mechanisms differ across subgroups and cities—that is, understanding where and for whom mechanisms apply—is essential to optimize the effectiveness of future neighborhood interventions. Mechanisms involving mediation by aspects of the school environment have been unexamined, but could prove promising for understanding differential effects of neighborhood on problematic drug use. The objective of this K99/R00 is to identify school-based mechanisms that mediate the relationship between neighborhood poverty and problematic drug use and to develop statistical methods to understand how mediation effects differ across subgroup and place. This objective contributes to the long-term goal of improving the effectiveness of interven- tions to prevent drug abuse and dependence by tailoring interventions to address the most relevant mechanisms of action for each target population based on place and individual-level characteristics. The K99 phase ﬁlls the following training gaps that are critical to achieving the research objective and long-term goal: 1) methodologic training in causal mediation analysis; 2) subject-matter training in drug abuse and dependence prevention in ur- ban populations; and 3) involvement in real-world school-based interventions to develop methods with practical utility. Aim 1 of the proposed research identiﬁes the school environment mechanisms that mediate the relationship between neighborhood poverty and adolescent problematic drug use and modiﬁers of those mechanisms. Aim 2 extends a statistical method recently developed by the proposed research team for generalizing intervention ef- fects from one city to another to generalizing mediation effects. Finally, Aim 3 uses the method developed in Aim 2 to identify how the school environment mechanisms mediating neighborhood poverty and problematic drug use differ across major U.S. cities. The proposed research is expected to identify school-based mechanisms underly- ing differential effects of neighborhood poverty on adolescent problematic drug use by subgroup and place using the only study of randomized neighborhood residence. In addition, it is expected to contribute a novel statistical method that incorporates cutting-edge machine learning techniques to identify which mediation mechanisms can generalize across place, advancing translational research. Successful interventions are assumed to work in differ- ent settings, but that is not the case in practice. The proposed research will allow us to predict intervention effects while accounting for differences in population composition and modiﬁers of the mediation mechanism. This will make a signiﬁcant contribution to improving health by informing the design and targeting of future neighborhood interventions to adolescents and places that may be most impacted in terms of problematic drug use prevention. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed research is to expected to advance understanding of how two important contexts—neighborhood and school—act together to inﬂuence problematic drug use among adolescents, including how these mechanisms differ across adolescent subgroups and places. In addition, the proposed research will result in the development of a ﬂexible statistical method to predict intervention mechanism effects in new target populations, taking into account population composition.

"Novel Approaches for Predicting Unstructured Short Periods of Physical Activities in Youth ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The use of accelerometers for the measurement of physical activity in youth has increased substantially over the last decade. Accelerometers are typically worn on the waist, however recently alternative placement sites such as the wrist have become more popular. For example, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is currently using the wrist location for their accelerometer physical activity measurements. Currently there is a lack of information about best approaches for analyzing accelerometer data from the wrist location with the ActiGraph accelerometer. In addition, advances in accelerometer technology allow for utilization of the raw acceleration signal with machine learning algorithms, which have the capability to predict activities and improve the estimates of energy expenditure over previously used methods. Members of this research group have shown improved activity classification and energy expenditure prediction in youth using Bipart, versus commonly used approaches such as Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machine. However, this preliminary work was based on accelerometer count data and structured lab activities with only a hip worn accelerometer. In addition, there are limitations to applying lab based models to true free-living activity. For example, free-living activity is not performed in structured bouts rather it is performed in micro-bouts over the course of the day which is problematic for methods designed to look at a string of data over a specified time period. There is minimal work currently on how to first segment bouts of free-living activity before classifying activity type and predicting energy expenditure. This proposal will extend our previous work using more advanced methods to analyze raw acceleration data (80 Hz) using a single wrist or hip worn accelerometer. One hundred youth will be measured during a semi-structured simulated free-living period (development group) and 200 youth will be measured during true free-living activity during an after-school program and at home (validation group). Measurements will include indirect calorimetry for energy expenditure and direct observation for activity type. The specific aims of the study are to: 1) develop and validate machine learning algorithms to segment bouts of activity during free-living activity in youth using: A) a hip worn accelerometer or B) a wrist worn accelerometer, and 2) develop and validate machine learning algorithms to classify physical activity type and estimate energy expenditure in youth, during free-living activity using: A) a hip worn accelerometer or B) a wrist worn accelerometer. Results from these studies will have direct and immediate impact for physical activity researchers utilizing accelerometers as well as analysis of NHANES wrist accelerometer data by providing ac- curate and precise methods for bout segmentation, prediction of activity type and energy expenditure.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop and validate machine learning algorithms using raw accelerometer data collected at the hip or wrist for use in youth. These algorithms will be able to detect the start and end times of free-living physical activity bouts, classify the type of activity being performed, and estimate energy expenditure, significantly improving upon current methods. These algorithms will have direct benefit to those examining dose response relationships between sedentary behaviors, physical activity and health outcomes in youth, in the physical activity and public health fields.            ",Novel Approaches for Predicting Unstructured Short Periods of Physical Activities in Youth,9030093,R01HD083431,"['Acceleration ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Algorithms ', ' Behavior ', ' Respiration Calorimetry ', ' Indirect Calorimetry ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Data Sources ', ' Energy Expenditure ', ' Energy Metabolism ', ' Environment ', ' Hip ', ' Coxa ', ' Hip region structure ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Methods ', ' body movement ', ' Movement ', ' Noise ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Sleep ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Wrist ', ' Measures ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ', ' NHANES ', ' Life ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Location ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' success ', ' neural network ', ' Biological Neural Networks ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' mate ', ' Partner in relationship ', ' Prevention ', ' afterschool program ', ' after-school program ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' model development ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Collection ', ' Validation ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Source Code ', ' obesity treatment ', ' time use ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' 18 year old ', ' eighteen year old ', ' age 18 years ', ' public health relevance ', ' data reduction ', ' sedentary lifestyle ', ' Sedentary life-style ', ' Sedentary behavior ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' Accelerometer ', ' activity tracker ', ' activity monitor ', ' accelerometry ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE KNOXVILLE,R01,2016,542228,TN-02,0.07051780226674631

"Preventing Drug Abuse among Hispanic Adolescents DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This resubmitted application addresses the weaknesses identified in its initial review. Prepared in response to PAS-09-001, Drug Abuse Epidemiology and Services Research in Cooperation with the Clinical and Translational Science Awards Consortium (R01), the application lays plans to develop, test, and disseminate an interactive program to delay the onset of drug use and to prevent harmful use and abuse among Hispanic youths. Study participants will come from Northern Manhattan, home to a large population of Hispanic families from Dominican, Puerto Rican, and other backgrounds. Grounded in bicultural competence and social learning theories, the prevention program will equip youths with cognitive and behavioral skills to address ethnic-specific and pan-ethnic risk and protective factors associated with drug use among Hispanic adolescents. Youths will access the program's 10 initial sessions and annual booster sessions via personal computer. Through a human simulation interaction platform, the program will employ artificial intelligence, graphic portrayals of emotional states, and a branched learning environment in which youths can acquire, try out, receive feedback on, and master new interpersonal skills. Cultural content woven into every programmatic session, together with sessions expressly dedicated to issues of acculturation, Hispanic traditions, and bicultural stress will give the program thematic coherence and enhance its attraction and value. The study design is a randomized clinical trial. Enrolled 11-, 12-, and 13-year-old youths will complete baseline measures, intervention-arm youths will receive the initial prevention program, and all youths will complete post-intervention and 12-, 24-, and 36-month follow-up measures. Intervention-arm youths will additionally receive pairs of booster sessions after they complete 12- and 24-month follow-up measurements. Hypothesis testing analyses will examine 30-day drug use rates between arms and across follow-up measurement occasions. In addition, we will analyze intervention effects on mediator variables associated with drug use risk and protective factors. We also will assess the extent to which changes on mediator variables explain drug use differences. And, we will examine gender differences, and, to the extent possible, immigration status and ethnic background differences in study outcomes. At the conclusion of the trial, and assuming that longitudinal findings support the tested prevention approach, we will revise the program to increase its appeal for Hispanic youth across America, and we will disseminate the revised program through a variety of online resources. Throughout, we will monitor program dissemination. This study will longitudinally test a computerized drug abuse prevention program for Hispanic adolescents. The culturally-tailored prevention program aims to strengthen and sustain protective factors while equipping youths with the necessary information and skills to reduce risk factors associated with cigarettes, alcohol, marijuana, and other harmful drug use.",Preventing Drug Abuse among Hispanic Adolescents,9114094,R01DA031477,"['Cultural Assimilation ', ' Acculturation ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Alcohols ', ' Americas ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Award ', ' Dorsum ', ' Back ', ' Behavior ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Data Collection ', ' abuses drugs ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' Drug abuse ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Family ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Services Research ', ' Household ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Immigrations ', ' In-Migration ', ' Institutes ', ' Learning ', ' marihuana ', ' Marijuana ', ' Play ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Schools ', ' Science ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' CD-ROM ', ' Compact Disk Read-Only Memory ', ' CDROM ', ' Friends ', ' Measures ', ' Competence ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Personal Computers ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Training ', ' school age ', ' School-Age Population ', ' Measurement ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' programs ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Outcome Study ', ' intervention program ', ' Cigarette ', ' Speed ', ' skills ', ' simulation ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention program ', ' member ', ' Emotional ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' prevent drug use ', ' prevent drug addiction ', ' prevent drug abuse ', ' drug use prevention ', ' drug addiction prevention ', ' drug abuse prevention ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Dominican ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Cognitive ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Behavioral ', ' post intervention ', ' youth drug use ', ' adolescent drug use ', ' computerized ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevention approach ', ' Approaches to prevention ', ' 13 year old ', ' thirteen year old ', ' age 13 years ', ' 18 year old ', ' eighteen year old ', ' age 18 years ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' social learning theory ', ' high risk ', ' intervention effect ', ' social networking website ', ' web-based social networking ', ' social networking web site ', ' social networking site ', ' online social networking ', ' arm ', ' educational atmosphere ', ' university atmosphere ', ' training atmosphere ', ' school atmosphere ', ' learning environment ', ' learning atmosphere ', ' intellectual atmosphere ', ' educational environment ', ' education atmosphere ', ' collegiate atmosphere ', ' collegial atmosphere ', ' college atmosphere ', ' classroom environment ', ' program dissemination ', ' project dissemination ', ' gender difference ', ' gender-associated difference ', ' ']",NIDA,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R01,2016,654688,NY-13,0.09284383705225357
"ABCD-USA Consortium:Research Project ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period that is associated with dramatic increases in rates of substance use. Identifying predictors of substance use and its effects on child and adolescent development is critically important, as substance-related decrements incurred during ongoing maturation could have long- lasting effects on brain functioning and behavioral, health, and psychological outcomes. In response to RFA- DA-15-015, this application proposes the University of Pittsburgh Research Project Site component [12/13] of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD)-USA consortium to prospectively determine the neurodevelopmental and behavioral effects of substance on children and adolescents. In Pittsburgh, a representative community sample of 550 9-10 year old substance-naïve children will be recruited (total ABCD- USA n=11,111 from 11 total sites) and will undergo a baseline assessment and two to three follow-ups over a five year period. At each assessment period, participants will undergo state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, and extensive assessment of substance use patterns and mental health functioning. The brain, behavioral, psychological, social, genetic, and environmental data collected during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects o substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the ""gateway interactions"" between use of different substances. Elements Unique to This Site: In addition, ABCD-USA Pittsburgh will provide a unique focus determining how the cognitive dimensions of working memory and inhibitory control and the maturation of corticostriatal systems can inform our understanding of the risks for and effects of early adolescent marijuana use. Working memory and inhibitory control improve during adolescence in parallel with maturation of underlying corticostriatal neurocircuitry. An understanding of these areas of adolescent brain and cognitive development provide critical information in models determining vulnerabilities for and consequences of marijuana and other substance use. In Y03, Pittsburgh will focus on analyses examining working memory and inhibitory control phenotypes and neurodevelopmental characteristics prior to substance use. In Y04-Y05, these neurocognitive characteristics will be examined as risks for early adolescent marijuana use trajectories and, in Y10, accelerated adolescent marijuana use trajectories. Machine Learning will be applied to integrating cognitive and neuroimaging features to characterize a model of risks for early adolescent marijuana use. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ABCD-USA Consortium will use multimodal brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, mobile monitoring, and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning in 11,111 adolescents followed over 10 years to determine the effects of substance use on adolescent brain and cognitive development.

"Novel Accelerometer Calibration and Validation in Children andAdolescents Summary Accelerometers have been embraced by the scientific community as valid and reliable physical activity (PA) assessment tools. This is especially true in some sub-populations, such as children, who lack the ability to self- report their behaviors. Tremendous progress has been made in the objective assessment of PA and sedentary behavior (SB). Several measurement challenges remain that limit our ability to identify; dose-response associations with disease and risk factors, prevalence and determinants of these important health behaviors, changes in behavior due to time and intervention efforts. To overcome these challenges, we propose novel calibration procedures that will leverage the richness of three axes of raw acceleration data during free-living calibration activities, from wrist- and hip-worn accelerometers. Consistent with current PA recommendations for youth, the proposed study will focus on calibrating and validating accelerometer output to quantify intensity and duration of PA and identifying specific predominant modes of activity (e.g., sedentary time, locomotion, and fine/gross motor activity). Our primary goal is to follow best-practices data collection and analysis procedures to develop a comprehensive set of accelerometer algorithms that will accurately and precisely estimate minutes of various intensities of PA and mode of activity from hip- and wrist-worn accelerometers in children and adolescents (18 months to 21 years old), using video recorded direct observation during free-living activities as the criterion measure. Narrative Accurate and precise estimates of physical activity, sedentary behavior, and patterns of those behaviors in youth are essential in order to identify changes in those behaviors and to inform related policy decisions. The proposed research will extend previous accelerometer calibration studies by videotaping free-living activities in a large sample across a wide age range of children and adolescents. The raw acceleration signals from both hip- and wrist-worn devices will be analyzed using linear regression and machine learning methods to generate a family of freely available algorithms that produce accurate and precise estimates, reducing inconsistencies and confusion on use of previous accelerometer cutpoints in youth.",Novel Accelerometer Calibration and Validation in Children andAdolescents,9157753,R01DK110148,"['Acceleration ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' Algorithms ', ' Behavior ', ' Calibration ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Communities ', ' Mental Confusion ', ' Confusional State ', ' Confusion ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Collection ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' artificial environment ', ' Controlled Environment ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Hip ', ' Coxa ', ' Hip region structure ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Linear Regressions ', ' Locomotion ', ' Methods ', ' Locomotor Activity ', ' Motor Activity ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Time ', ' Video Recording ', ' video recording system ', ' Videorecording ', ' Videotape ', ' Wrist ', ' Measures ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' sedentary ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Frequencies ', ' Pattern ', ' behavior change ', ' age group ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Devices ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' data processing ', ' computerized data processing ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Output ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' 21 year old ', ' twenty-one year old ', ' age 21 years ', ' age 21 ', ' Health behavior change ', ' sedentary lifestyle ', ' Sedentary life-style ', ' Sedentary behavior ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' Accelerometer ', ' activity tracker ', ' activity monitor ', ' accelerometry ', ' sedentary activity ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST,R01,2016,400434,MA-02,0.03924871945760064

"ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period associated with dramatic increases in rates of substance use. Identifying the pathways to substance use and its effects on child and adolescent development is critically important, as the effects of substance use during ongoing maturation likely have long-lasting effects on brain functioning and behavioral, health, and psychological outcomes. This Research Project Site application from the University of California, San Diego and Laureate Institute for Brain Research is in response to RFA-DA-15-015 as part of the ABCD-USA Consortium (5/13), to prospectively determine the neurodevelopmental and behavioral predictors and consequences of substance use on children and adolescents. A representative community sample of 1086 9-10 year olds enriched for high- risk characteristics will be recruited, contributing to the sample f 11,111 to be collected from 11 hubs across the ABCD- USA Consortium. All participants will undergo a comprehensive baseline assessment, including state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, bioassays, mobile monitoring and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning every 2 years. Interim annual interviews and quarterly web-based assessments will provide refined temporal resolution of behaviors, development, and life events with minimal participant burden. These Consortium-wide data obtained during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects of substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the ""gateway interactions"" between use of different substances. This hub's Research Project focuses on mechanisms of substance use disorder, special populations with high use prevalence, and the use of drugs other than marijuana. (1) We will determine whether individual differences in neural processing of antireward (i.e., negative reinforcement mechanisms) in amygdala, insula, and anterior cingulate are associated with increased negative emotionality and pain, predict initiation of use and problem use, and are in turn further dysregulated by substance use. (2) We will determine whether protective environment factors and ethnic identification in minority youth are linked to healthier antireward processing and better substance use outcomes. (3) We will determine whether antireward neural processing predicts increased use of illicit drugs other than MJ including misuse of prescription drugs, if such use predicts subsequent exaggerated antireward processing, and if gateway interactions exist between substances. Finally, we will use machine learning approaches to develop a youth-specific risk calculator that will enable us to identify individually- based modifiable risk factor, providing brain-based targets of future novel prevention and intervention approaches. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ABCD-USA Consortium will use multimodal brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, mobile monitoring, and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning in 11,111 adolescents followed over 10 years to determine the effects of substance use on adolescent brain and cognitive development. Our 5/13 ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project will recruit and assess 1086 youth age 9-10 at project entry. In addition to contributions to the overall consortium, our U01 will specifically focus on negative reinforcement mechanisms of substance use disorder, special populations with high SUD prevalence,

"Pattern Analysis of fMRI via machine learning/sparse models: application to brain development Abstract Resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) provides reproducible, task-independent biomarkers of coherent functional activity linking different brain regions. The main goal of the proposed project is to leverage advances in signal processing and machine learning methods to derive clinically useful biomarkers based on patterns of functional connectivity, and to test these biomarkers in a large study of brain development. Central to our methodology are 1) computing a subject-specific functional parcellation of the brain, which defines nodes for characterizing individualized functional brain networks; 2) extracting sparse connectivity patterns for robustly representing brain networks; 3) capturing heterogeneity in brain networks across individuals in a given population; and 4) deriving individualized predictive indices of psychosis risk from brain connectivity in a large study of brain development. This novel suite of functional connectivity analysis tools will be developed and validated based on data from the Human Connectome Project and the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC). Finally, these techniques will be applied to PNC data in order to delineate heterogeneity in network development in youth with psychosis-spectrum symptoms. Our hypothesis is that patterns of functional connectivity in adolescents with psychosis-spectrum symptoms will be different from those in typically developing adolescents, and this difference will display a high degree of heterogeneity that is linked to underlying heterogeneity in pathologic neurodevelopmental trajectories. Moreover, we expect that machine learning techniques will allow us to predict on an individual basis which adolescents with psychosis-spectrum symptoms will remain stable, which will revert to normal, and which will progress to psychosis, based on their baseline functional connectivity signatures. Our methods are generally applicable to rsfMRI studies for detecting and quantifying spatio-temporal functional connectivity patterns in diverse fields, including diagnosing brain abnormalities in neuropsychiatric diseases, and finding associations of functional connectivity with different cognitive functions. All methods will be made publicly available and form an important new resource for the broader neuroscience community. Project narrative This proposal develops a suite of advanced functional imaging pattern analysis methods, aiming to delineate heterogeneity in brain network development in youth with psychosis-spectrum symptoms, ultimately leading to early biomarkers of neuropsychiatric disorders. Methodologically, the proposed work leverages upon the strengths of sparse and non-negative decompositions of imaging data, which offer several advantages over conventional mass-univariate and linear multivariate methods. One of the largest and most comprehensive cohorts of 1,600 individuals ages 8 through 21 provides unique imaging and clinical data to support the application of these methods to brain development.",Pattern Analysis of fMRI via machine learning/sparse models: application to brain development,9307803,R01EB022573,"['ages ', ' Age ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomy ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Dictionary ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' indexing ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Philadelphia ', ' Psychotic Disorders ', ' psychotic illness ', ' Psychoses ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' cognitive function ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' human data ', ' cohort ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' novel ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Subgroup ', ' Clinical Data ', ' physiological imaging ', ' Physiologic Imaging ', ' Functional Imaging ', ' Pattern Recognition ', ' Pathologic ', ' trend ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' signal processing ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' clinical biomarkers ', ' clinically useful biomarkers ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' connectome ', ' brain abnormalities ', ' ']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2017,549838,PA-03,0.029993073657769986

We have assembled a team of investigators with unparalleled research experience with children and adolescents, and specific expertise in adolescent SU, child and adolescent development, developmental psychopathology, longitudinal multi-site imaging, developmental neuroimaging, developmental cognitive neuroscience, genetics and imaging genetics, bioassays, epidemiology, survey research, bioinformatics, and mobile assessment technologies. We propose a comprehensive, nationwide study to be conducted at 21 sites organized into 11 hubs (over 89 million Americans, 29% of the US population, live within 50 miles of our geographically spread sites), that, uniquely, can provide a nationally representative sample and a large twin sample that together can help distinguish environmental, sociocultural, and genetic factors relevant to SU. We ensure cohesion and standardization by employing a recruitment strategy designed by a professional survey company (experience with Monitoring the Future); standardized environmental, neurocognitive and mental health assessments, MRI assessments with all scanners using harmonized Human Connectome Project procedures, and computerized data collection with real-time quality control. Developmentally tailored assessments will have stable sensitivity and construct validity across the childhood and adolescent developmental period.

"Novel Approaches for Predicting Unstructured Short Periods of Physical Activities in Youth ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The use of accelerometers for the measurement of physical activity in youth has increased substantially over the last decade. Accelerometers are typically worn on the waist, however recently alternative placement sites such as the wrist have become more popular. For example, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is currently using the wrist location for their accelerometer physical activity measurements. Currently there is a lack of information about best approaches for analyzing accelerometer data from the wrist location with the ActiGraph accelerometer. In addition, advances in accelerometer technology allow for utilization of the raw acceleration signal with machine learning algorithms, which have the capability to predict activities and improve the estimates of energy expenditure over previously used methods. Members of this research group have shown improved activity classification and energy expenditure prediction in youth using Bipart, versus commonly used approaches such as Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machine. However, this preliminary work was based on accelerometer count data and structured lab activities with only a hip worn accelerometer. In addition, there are limitations to applying lab based models to true free-living activity. For example, free-living activity is not performed in structured bouts rather it is performed in micro-bouts over the course of the day which is problematic for methods designed to look at a string of data over a specified time period. There is minimal work currently on how to first segment bouts of free-living activity before classifying activity type and predicting energy expenditure. This proposal will extend our previous work using more advanced methods to analyze raw acceleration data (80 Hz) using a single wrist or hip worn accelerometer. One hundred youth will be measured during a semi-structured simulated free-living period (development group) and 200 youth will be measured during true free-living activity during an after-school program and at home (validation group). Measurements will include indirect calorimetry for energy expenditure and direct observation for activity type. The specific aims of the study are to: 1) develop and validate machine learning algorithms to segment bouts of activity during free-living activity in youth using: A) a hip worn accelerometer or B) a wrist worn accelerometer, and 2) develop and validate machine learning algorithms to classify physical activity type and estimate energy expenditure in youth, during free-living activity using: A) a hip worn accelerometer or B) a wrist worn accelerometer. Results from these studies will have direct and immediate impact for physical activity researchers utilizing accelerometers as well as analysis of NHANES wrist accelerometer data by providing ac- curate and precise methods for bout segmentation, prediction of activity type and energy expenditure.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop and validate machine learning algorithms using raw accelerometer data collected at the hip or wrist for use in youth. These algorithms will be able to detect the start and end times of free-living physical activity bouts, classify the type of activity being performed, and estimate energy expenditure, significantly improving upon current methods.

"PAGES: Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site Project Summary Physical activity (PA) prevents or ameliorates a large number of diseases, and inactivity is the 4th leading global mortality risk factor. The molecular mechanisms responsible for the diverse benefits of PA are not well understood. The Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) is being formed to advance knowledge in this area. We propose to establish PAGES, a Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site as an integral component of the MoTrPAC. PAGES will conduct comprehensive analyses of the rat and human PA intervention MoTrPAC samples, contribute these data to public databases, help identify candidate molecular transducers of PA and elucidate new PA response mechanisms, and help develop predictive models of the individual response to PA. PAGES assay sites at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York Genome Center and Broad Institute provide the infrastructure, expertise and experience to support this large scale, comprehensive analysis of molecular changes associated with PA. PAGES aims are to 1. Work with the MoTrPAC Steering Committee in Year 1 to finalize plans and protocols; 2. Perform assays and analyses to help Identify candidate molecular transducers of the response to PA in rat models and the pathways responsible for model differences, including high-depth RNA-seq and Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS), supplemented by additional assay types such as ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq based on initial results; 3. Perform comprehensive assays and analyses of the human MoTrPAC clinical study tissue samples, including RNA-seq, WGBS, H3K27ac ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq and whole genome sequencing. 4. Collaborate with the MoTrPAC to analyze data from PAGES and other MoTrPAC analysis sites to identify candidate PA transducers and molecular mechanisms, and to develop predictive models of PA capacity and response to training. The success of PAGES and the MoTrPAC program will transform insight into the molecular networks that transduce PA into health, create an unparalleled comprehensive public PA data resource, and can provide the foundation for profound advances in the prevention and treatment of many major human diseases. Project Narrative While physical activity prevents or improves a large number of diseases, the chemical changes that occur in the body and lead to better health are not well known. As a part of a consortium of physical activity research programs working together, we will use cutting-edge approaches to comprehensively study the changes in genes and gene products caused by physical activity. This study has the potential to lead to advances in the prevention and treatment of many diseases.","PAGES: Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site",9508669,U24DK112331,"['Algorithms ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Budgets ', ' Chromatin ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Elements ', ' Foundations ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Institutes ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' New York ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Production ', ' Rattus ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Rat ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Risk Factors ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' training module ', ' Training Activity ', ' Transducers ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' sedentary ', ' Chemicals ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Research Activity ', ' data storage ', ' data retrieval ', ' Data Storage and Retrieval ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' Deposition ', ' Deposit ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' experience ', ' human data ', ' success ', ' Prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' high throughput analysis ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Genomics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' genome sequencing ', ' fitness ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Analysis ', ' Rat Strains ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Ontology ', ' Validation ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' meta data ', ' Metadata ', ' epigenomics ', ' cost ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' transcriptomics ', ' human disease ', ' web page ', ' webpage ', ' ChIP-seq ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing ', ' ChIP Sequencing ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' methylome ', ' bisulfite sequencing ', ' bisulfite-seq ', ' BS-seq ', ' ATAC-seq ', ' ATACseq ', ' web portal ', ' internet portal ', ' transcriptome ', ' gene product ', ' whole genome ', ' entire genome ', ' data resource ', ' ']",NIDDK,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U24,2017,162828,NY-13,0.031703489677376406
"Adolescent Brain Bases of Intergenerational Risk for Depression Project Summary Adolescence is a critical time for understanding Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) because nearly half of lifetime diagnoses of psychiatric disorders begin by age 14. Further, intergenerational risk for depression (RISK; having a parent with MDD) increases adolescent likelihood of developing MDD by three- to five-fold. The goal of this research is to understand adolescent neural factors associated with RISK and to characterize the neurodevelopmental path of RISK adolescents. The proposed research adds to an ongoing NIMH grant (U01MH108168) that compares brain function and structure between adolescents (ages 14-15) with MDD and adolescents without MDD/intergenerational risk for MDD (CON). I propose to add a new group of adolescents who are at intergenerational risk for depression (RISK) to address the following aims. First, I aim to dissociate functional and structural neural differences between risk (traits) and clinical diagnosis (state) of adolescent MDD. I will recruit and characterize 120 age- and sex-matched adolescents (ages 14-15): 40 adolescents at RISK for depression but without a personal history of MDD (RISK), 40 adolescents without RISK and no history of MDD (CON), and 40 adolescents with current MDD. I will perform (a) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), (b) structural MRI (sMRI), and (c) diffusion MRI (dMRI). Second, I aim to discover neurodevelopmental differences associated with RISK. I will re-characterize and re-scan RISK and CON adolescents two years after initial scanning. I will assess differences in functional and structural neurodevelopment between RISK and CON adolescents over this two-year period. I will also assess the extent to which RISK-associated neurodevelopmental changes in brain function and structure are related to development of depressive symptoms. Third, I aim to discover whether multimodal baseline measures predict progression of depressive symptoms in RISK adolescents. All 120 adolescents will undergo extensive clinical and neural characterization at study enrollment, and will undergo follow-up clinical examinations every six months for two years post- enrollment. I will determine whether behavioral and/or brain measures at enrollment predict the subsequent progression of depressive symptoms over this two-year period. The proposed research would be the first to: 1) dissociate functional and structural brain differences between RISK, MDD, and CON adolescents, 2) determine neurodevelopmental changes in RISK compared to CON adolescents, and 3) provide precise biological prediction of the development of depressive symptomology in at-risk adolescents. Knowledge gained from this study will provide a new understanding of the neural underpinning of both risk and developed depression in adolescence, as well as provide valuable contribution toward early prevention of MDD. Project Narrative Children of depressed parents are at increased risk for substance abuse, psychiatric disorders, and decreased social and scholastic functioning. The goal of this research is to understand adolescent neural factors associated with familial risk for depression and to characterize the neurodevelopmental path of these adolescents. We will use advanced behavioral and neuroimaging techniques to understand how developmental changes in the brain are implicated in developmental changes in depressive symptoms in adolescents at familial risk for depression.",Adolescent Brain Bases of Intergenerational Risk for Depression,9396635,F32MH114525,"['adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' face expression ', ' Facial Expression ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Moods ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Parents ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Measures ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' career ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Training ', ' Early Intervention ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' Depressed mood ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Psychiatric Diagnosis ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scanning ', ' Techniques ', ' Dyslexia ', ' Word Blindness ', ' intergenerational ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Neural Development ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' white matter ', ' substantia alba ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Deterioration ', ' Modeling ', ' brain volume ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' dMRI ', ' Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Diffusion weighted imaging ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' DWI-MRI ', ' DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' major depression disorder ', ' major depression ', ' clinical depression ', ' Address ', ' Base of the Brain ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Validation ', ' sex ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' feelings ', ' Feeling ', ' Behavioral ', ' Behavioral Assay ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' youth depression ', ' pediatric depression ', ' depression in adolescence ', ' depressed adolescents ', ' childhood onset depression ', ' childhood depression ', ' adolescents with depression ', ' adolescent depression ', ' child depression ', ' Affective ', ' multimodality ', ' Social Anxiety Disorder ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' ']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,F32,2017,56334,MA-07,0.10494037892471265
"ABCD-USA Consortium: Data Analysis Center ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ABCD-USA Consortium proposes a study designed to permit the scientific community to answer important questions about the effects of substance use (SU) patterns on behavioral and brain development of adolescents. We have assembled a team of investigators with unparalleled research experience with children and adolescents, and specific expertise in adolescent SU, child and adolescent development, developmental psychopathology, longitudinal multi-site imaging, developmental neuroimaging, developmental cognitive neuroscience, genetics and imaging genetics, bioassays, epidemiology, survey research, bioinformatics, and mobile assessment technologies. We propose a comprehensive, nationwide study to be conducted at 21 sites organized into 11 hubs (over 89 million Americans, 29% of the US population, live within 50 miles of our geographically spread sites), that, uniquely, can provide a nationally representative sample and a large twin sample that together can help distinguish environmental, sociocultural, and genetic factors relevant to SU. We ensure cohesion and standardization by employing a recruitment strategy designed by a professional survey company (experience with Monitoring the Future); standardized environmental, neurocognitive and mental health assessments, MRI assessments with all scanners using harmonized Human Connectome Project procedures, and computerized data collection with real-time quality control. Developmentally tailored assessments will have stable sensitivity and construct validity across the childhood and adolescent developmental period. They minimize participant burden, yet capture even subtle changes over time in substance use, mental health, neurocognition, development, and environment, and we employ novel state-of-the-art bioassays and passive data collection from mobile devices. A detailed retention plan builds on the experience and success of our investigators. This application describes the ABCD-USA Data Analysis and Informatics Center (DAIC), which will: establish a harmonized MRI acquisition protocol, compatible with all major scanner platforms, taking advantage of recent technological advances in structural and functional MRI; establish rigorous quality control and quantitative calibration procedures to ensure accuracy and comparability of derived imaging measures across scanners and across time; implement advanced computational analysis workflows for all imaging data; implement reliable data entry, quality control, and monitoring tools for the substance use questionnaire, neurocognitive assessments, bioassay-derived measures, and mobile technologies assessment data; implement the state- of-the-art statistical analysis tools and procedures needed to integrate information across measures and modalities; and implement infrastructure and procedures for public sharing of raw- and derived data and associated tools and computational workflows, and enable interactive data exploration and analytics through a web-based Portal.

"Externalizing outcomes in high risk youth Project Summary/abstract Public attention has often been drawn to the relationship between violence and mental health issues, but violent behavior is a very complex phenomenon undergirded by myriad social, psychological, environmental, and biological influences. This project intends to investigate these influences among a large sample of previously incarcerated youth, following up with them and collecting valuable longitudinal data. Our team worked with these youth and their families collecting detailed psychological, behavioral, and neuroimaging measures as part of a previous NIH-funded investigation. The current project aims to re-assess these individuals (now young adults) to examine long-range positive (i.e., desistance from drug use/antisocial behavior) and negative (relapse to drugs, antisocial behavior) outcomes. We will collect new neuroimaging scans, which combined with prior MRI data, will be useful for quantifying trajectories of change that map to persistence and desistence from externalizing outcomes. Advanced machine-learning approaches will be utilized in conjunction with structural, functional, network, and dynamic network brain measures in addition to behavioral and psychological measures. Machine learning approaches are capable of identifying patterns in high-dimensional data and delineating the unique combinations of variables that are most predictive of specific outcome variables. Using these methods, we intend to define neural mechanisms that predict outcomes. We also aim to identify combinations of variables that confer greater risk for persistent antisocial behavior and violence. The translational value of this work will be to clarify informative patterns of data that may indicate preventable outcomes. Furthermore, neural measures indicative of specific vulnerability will be identified as specific targets for treatment and novel intervention strategies. By identifying specific vulnerabilities and the changes that accompany positive outcomes, we will be closer to understanding the best way to recognize and prevent costly violent behavior. Project Narrative Recent attention has been drawn to the relationship between mental health issues and potentially preventable forms of violence, antisocial behavior, and substance abuse. This project aims to investigate neural, psychological, and life-course variables that may help predict divergent trajectories for persistent antisocial behavior and desistance by applying advanced statistical models in conjunction with longitudinal data from a unique sample of antisocial youth.

"Course and Outcome of Bipolar Disorder in Youth ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Course and Outcome of Bipolar Disorders in Youth (COBY) study has comprehensively characterized the clinical course of a large sample of youth with bipolar disorder (BD), and has identified demographic and clinical factors that are associated with different illness courses. To date, however, COBY has not included neuroimaging assessments. Including such assessments now will allow, for the first time, an evaluation of the impact of 13-year course of BD and treatment upon neural circuitry function and structure. Furthermore, the majority of COBY participants are currently between 18-30 years old, when the brain, and prefrontal cortex in particular, continues to develop. Including neuroimaging assessments in COBY participants now can thus take advantage of the neurodevelopmental processes occurring between 18-30 years where there are unique opportunities to intervene therapeutically to help normalize abnormalities in neural functioning and structure. Focusing on this age range will also provide a critically important opportunity to determine the extent to which neuroimaging measures predict future clinical course in adulthood. Having normal prefrontal cortical function and structure may predict better clinical course in adulthood, even in COBY participants with poor clinical course in youth, and may lead to decisions to reduce, or even stop, specific treatments in these individuals. In the proposed study, we will determine how previous BD clinical course (e.g., % time with mood symptoms vs. euthymic; % time with comorbid disorders) and treatment exposure from childhood into adulthood impacts neural circuitry functioning and structure supporting key NIMH RDoC information processing domains, and compare neuroimaging findings in COBY participants with those of demographically-matched healthy controls (Aim 1). We will also determine whether neuroimaging measures predict illness course in adulthood, beyond demographic and clinical factors, and previous clinical course in youth (Aim 2). We will use machine learning to explore patterns of wholebrain functioning, white and gray matter structure, and clinical and demographic measures, that most accurately predict future clinical course at the individual subject level. The proposed study also provides a valuable opportunity to inform the field regarding the clinical and functional course and outcome from youth into adulthood in a large, well-characterized sample of people with BD. This is important because the clinical outcome of BD youth in adulthood remains uncertain, as only two studies with a total of 72 subjects followed BD youth into their early twenties. Structural and functional neuroimaging techniques will be employed in a representative subsample of COBY participants (n=120), and healthy controls (n=50). Comprehensive assessments of psychopathology and functioning will be collected at the time of neuroimaging, and twice more during the proposed project period in the 120 COBY participants. This proposal accords with the NIMH's mission to define developmental trajectories of mental disorders and develop strategies to better define risk and protective factors for disease trajectories across the lifespan, and with the RDoC initiative. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The aim of the proposed study is to identify the impact of long-term previous clinical course and treatment on the brain in individuals with childhood-onset bipolar disorder, and examine how these changes in the brain influence future clinical course during adulthood. The participants are currently between 18-30 years old when the brain begins to achieve full maturity. Thus, this study will provide a unique opportunity to determine the extent to which neuroimaging measures predict future clinical course during an important neurodevelopmental period in individuals with bipolar disorder and can yield findings that will aid treatment decisions for these individuals.",Course and Outcome of Bipolar Disorder in Youth,9251907,R01MH059929,"['Accounting ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' Anxiety ', ' Arousal ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Future ', ' substantia grisea ', ' gray matter ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hippocampus ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Literature ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Mission ', ' Moods ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' Medial ', ' Clinical ', ' Fiber ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' disorder onset ', ' disease onset ', ' Onset of illness ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' psychosocial ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Structure ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' Participant ', ' white matter ', ' substantia alba ', ' Neurophysiology - biologic function ', ' neural function ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Ventral Striatum ', ' neural circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' Emotional ', ' Sampling ', ' Symptoms ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' positive emotion ', ' positive emotional state ', ' Outcome ', ' Impact evaluation ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' reward processing ', ' cognitive control ', ' critical period ', ' information processing ', ' public health relevance ', ' multimodality ', ' neural patterning ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' RDoC ', ' Positive Valence ', ' Negative Valence ', ' symptomatology ', ' associated symptom ', ' symptom comorbidity ', ' symptom association ', ' cooccuring symptom ', ' concurrent symptom ', ' comorbid symptom ', ' mood symptom ', ' clinical imaging ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,653164,PA-18,0.06677565500068593
"Automated Ecological Video Identification of Physical Activity (E-VIP) Software ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal addresses multiple priorities of PAR-12-197 ""Improving Diet and Physical Activity (PA) Assessment"" by advancing assessment of population PA in common settings. Physical inactivity is responsible for ≈200,000 deaths in the US and 5 million deaths worldwide annually. About 10% of breast and 10% of colon cancers are attributable to insufficient PA, and inactivity causes 9% of total premature mortality. Parks, schools and youth sports are important contributors of PA that are relevant to a majority of the population. Supporting PA in these settings would contribute to improvements in population levels of PA and disease prevention and control. We will develop a novel video analysis software system, named E-VIP (Ecological Video Identification of PA), which will estimate the number of people and aggregated volume of PA from video recordings of PA- relevant settings. E-VIP will provide automated and continuous (rather than momentary) assessment, which will allow ongoing feedback to inform adaptive interventions and decision making. E-VIP is based on computer science methods used to count crowds and identify behaviors. We will train the E-VIP machine learning algorithm on 32,400 seconds of video from 2 parks, 2 schools, and 2 youth sports settings. Participants will engage in a variety of activities while wearing accelerometers to capture PA intensity in Metabolic Equivalents (METs). The testing phase involves capturing 900, 5-minute videos of free-living behavior across 4 parks, 4 schools, and 4 youth sports settings, with half of the settings/zones being the same as from the training phase. A range of activities and density of people will be captured in both the training and testing phase to maximize coverage of more-difficult high-density situations. Systematic direct observation will be conducted on each time sample to provide the criterion measure for testing validity. The metrics that will be tested include the average number of people, average proportion of people in each activity category (sedentary, light, moderate, vigorous, very vigorous), and sum PA MET-minutes in the setting over the 5-minute (or any given) time period. A gender and age group classifier will be explored. PE classes taught by PE specialists vs classroom teachers will be compared to test construct validity of E-VIP. Bland Altman methods and intraclass correlation coefficients will be used to assess agreement. Potential sources of error such as occlusions (e.g., trees, shadows, other people) will be assessed using moderator analyses. By automating ecological PA assessment, E-VIP will be feasible for widespread use. E-VIP's capability of continuous assessment will improve precision by collecting higher resolution data than collected by existing direct observation tools. When embedded in specific settings through commonly-used security cameras or webcams, or by purposefully placing video recorders, E-VIP will be capable of ongoing assessment which will inform public health surveillance, intervention, and evidence-based decision making (e.g., optimizing intervention strategies, monitoring school Physical Education mandates, providing needs assessment prior to and evaluation after environmental modifications). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will develop and test a software for automated ongoing measurement of use and physical activity intensity from video recordings in specific settings such as parks, schools (including Physical Education), and youth sports. This innovative software will support adaptive multilevel interventions and evidence-based decision making in physical activity-relevant settings to optimize strategies for improving population health.",Automated Ecological Video Identification of Physical Activity (E-VIP) Software,9210068,R21CA194492,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Algorithms ', ' Behavior ', ' Breast ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Crowding ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Decision Making ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Engineering ', ' Exhibits ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Methods ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Names ', ' Physical Education ', ' Physical Education and Training ', ' Population Surveillance ', ' Public Health Surveillance ', ' Public Health ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Schools ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Sports ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Trees ', ' video recording system ', ' Videorecording ', ' Video Recording ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Specialist ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' sedentary ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' teacher ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Premature Mortality ', ' Error Sources ', ' Measurement ', ' Metabolic ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Hour ', ' Complex ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' age group ', ' computer science ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' disorder prevention ', ' disease prevention ', ' Agreement ', ' Categories ', ' Colon Carcinoma ', ' cancer in the colon ', ' Colonic Carcinoma ', ' Colon Cancer ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' disorder control ', ' disease control ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Sum ', ' Security ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' cost ', ' digital ', ' software systems ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' prototype ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' population health ', ' Algorithmic Software ', ' Software Algorithm ', ' Algorithmic Tools ', ' physical inactivity ', ' lack of physical activity ', ' Accelerometer ', ' activity tracker ', ' activity monitor ', ' accelerometry ', ' ']",NCI,"CHILDREN'S MERCY HOSP (KANSAS CITY, MO)",R21,2017,152937,MO-05,0.04635933992887933
"PAGES: Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site Project Summary Physical activity (PA) prevents or ameliorates a large number of diseases, and inactivity is the 4th leading global mortality risk factor. The molecular mechanisms responsible for the diverse benefits of PA are not well understood. The Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) is being formed to advance knowledge in this area. We propose to establish PAGES, a Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site as an integral component of the MoTrPAC. PAGES will conduct comprehensive analyses of the rat and human PA intervention MoTrPAC samples, contribute these data to public databases, help identify candidate molecular transducers of PA and elucidate new PA response mechanisms, and help develop predictive models of the individual response to PA. PAGES assay sites at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York Genome Center and Broad Institute provide the infrastructure, expertise and experience to support this large scale, comprehensive analysis of molecular changes associated with PA. PAGES aims are to 1. Work with the MoTrPAC Steering Committee in Year 1 to finalize plans and protocols; 2. Perform assays and analyses to help Identify candidate molecular transducers of the response to PA in rat models and the pathways responsible for model differences, including high-depth RNA-seq and Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS), supplemented by additional assay types such as ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq based on initial results; 3. Perform comprehensive assays and analyses of the human MoTrPAC clinical study tissue samples, including RNA-seq, WGBS, H3K27ac ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq and whole genome sequencing. 4. Collaborate with the MoTrPAC to analyze data from PAGES and other MoTrPAC analysis sites to identify candidate PA transducers and molecular mechanisms, and to develop predictive models of PA capacity and response to training. The success of PAGES and the MoTrPAC program will transform insight into the molecular networks that transduce PA into health, create an unparalleled comprehensive public PA data resource, and can provide the foundation for profound advances in the prevention and treatment of many major human diseases. Project Narrative While physical activity prevents or improves a large number of diseases, the chemical changes that occur in the body and lead to better health are not well known. As a part of a consortium of physical activity research programs working together, we will use cutting-edge approaches to comprehensively study the changes in genes and gene products caused by physical activity.

"Impulsivity as Immaturity: Mapping Dysmaturation of the Brain's Control Architecture in Youth Externalizing Psychopathology ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Youth with externalizing psychopathologies, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and conduct disorder, present with diverse kinds of impulsivity symptoms, which in turn reflect deficits in regulatory control functioning. An emerging neurodevelopmental model, which we call the Impulsivity as Immaturity Model, could potentially transform our understanding of the brain basis of regulatory dysfunction. The brain's regulatory control architecture (RCA) undergoes massive maturation during childhood and adolescence. The Impulsivity as Immaturity Model proposes that aberrant maturation in distinct components of the RCA gives rise to distinct patterns of impulsivity symptoms-e.g., delayed maturation in certain attention control components gives rise to attentional variability, a specific form of attention dysfunction. Informed by this model, we will use a mixed cohort/longitudinal design enrolling 135 healthy youth and 135 youth with externalizing psychopathologies. Using advanced multivariate/multimodal analytic methods, we will map the normative neurodevelopmental trajectories of major components of the RCA including components involved in attention, motor, emotion, and appetitive control. We will then construct multivariate models that predict different forms of impulsivity based on neurodevelopment patterns of RCA components. Successful completion of this project will be a critical first step in development of a new class of imaging-based immaturity biomarkers that index distinct types of impulsivity irrespective of the specific externalizing disorders in which they manifest. This will lead to earlier, more reliable diagnosis of impulsivity problems in youth and spur the development of transdiagnostic, biologically based interventions that target specific forms of RCA dysmaturation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Using neuroimaging, we will map the development of key components of the brain's regulatory control architecture in a sample of youth with externalizing disorders and diverse kinds of impulsivity symptoms. We will use these maps to develop a new class of neuroimaging biomarkers for specific forms of impulsivity. This research will advance the development of biologically informed dimensional approaches for characterizing complex impulsivity phenotypes and will spur the development of new treatments.",Impulsivity as Immaturity: Mapping Dysmaturation of the Brain's Control Architecture in Youth Externalizing Psychopathology,9296185,R01MH107741,"['adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Appetite ', ' Desire for food ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Architecture ', ' Attention ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Emotions ', ' indexing ', ' Joints ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Michigan ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Neuropsychology ', ' neuropsychologic ', ' Neuropsychologies ', ' Oppositional Defiant Disorder ', ' Phenotype ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Rewards ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' disorders of conduct ', ' disorder of conduct ', ' Conduct Disorder ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Hyperactive behavior ', ' Motor Hyperactivity ', ' Hyperkinetic Movements ', ' Hyperkinesis ', ' Hyperkinesia ', ' Hyperactivity ', ' Investigation ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Pattern ', ' mind control ', ' brain control ', ' cohort ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Neural Development ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' Participant ', ' research study ', ' Categories ', ' disease classification ', ' nosology ', ' disorder classification ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Hyperactivity Disorder NOS ', ' ADHD ', ' AD/HD ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' vector ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Advanced Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' independent component analysis ', ' public health relevance ', ' multimodality ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' early adolescence ', ' longitudinal design ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' RDoC ', ' attentional control ', ' emotion dysregulation ', ' emotional dysregulation ', ' specific biomarkers ', ' connectome ', ' Longitudinal cohort ', ' Longterm cohort ', ' Long-term cohort ', ' neuroimaging marker ', ' neuroimaging biomarker ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2017,572607,MI-12,0.05788577218443883

"Mechanisms Underlying Differential Effects of Neighborhood Poverty on Problematic Adolescent Drug Use PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Where a child grows up can inﬂuence his or her risk of problematic drug use. Surprisingly, policies and programs designed to improve neighborhood conditions have yielded conﬂicting results in which some children beneﬁt but others are harmed. Understanding the mechanisms by which neighborhoods act to affect problem- atic drug use and how these mechanisms differ across subgroups and cities—that is, understanding where and for whom mechanisms apply—is essential to optimize the effectiveness of future neighborhood interventions. Mechanisms involving mediation by aspects of the school environment have been unexamined, but could prove promising for understanding differential effects of neighborhood on problematic drug use. The objective of this K99/R00 is to identify school-based mechanisms that mediate the relationship between neighborhood poverty and problematic drug use and to develop statistical methods to understand how mediation effects differ across subgroup and place. This objective contributes to the long-term goal of improving the effectiveness of interven- tions to prevent drug abuse and dependence by tailoring interventions to address the most relevant mechanisms of action for each target population based on place and individual-level characteristics. The K99 phase ﬁlls the following training gaps that are critical to achieving the research objective and long-term goal: 1) methodologic training in causal mediation analysis; 2) subject-matter training in drug abuse and dependence prevention in ur- ban populations; and 3) involvement in real-world school-based interventions to develop methods with practical utility. Aim 1 of the proposed research identiﬁes the school environment mechanisms that mediate the relationship between neighborhood poverty and adolescent problematic drug use and modiﬁers of those mechanisms. Aim 2 extends a statistical method recently developed by the proposed research team for generalizing intervention ef- fects from one city to another to generalizing mediation effects. Finally, Aim 3 uses the method developed in Aim 2 to identify how the school environment mechanisms mediating neighborhood poverty and problematic drug use differ across major U.S. cities. The proposed research is expected to identify school-based mechanisms underly- ing differential effects of neighborhood poverty on adolescent problematic drug use by subgroup and place using the only study of randomized neighborhood residence. In addition, it is expected to contribute a novel statistical method that incorporates cutting-edge machine learning techniques to identify which mediation mechanisms can generalize across place, advancing translational research. Successful interventions are assumed to work in differ- ent settings, but that is not the case in practice. The proposed research will allow us to predict intervention effects while accounting for differences in population composition and modiﬁers of the mediation mechanism. This will make a signiﬁcant contribution to improving health by informing the design and targeting of future neighborhood interventions to adolescents and places that may be most impacted in terms of problematic drug use prevention. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed research is to expected to advance understanding of how two important contexts—neighborhood and school—act together to inﬂuence problematic drug use among adolescents, including how these mechanisms differ across adolescent subgroups and places. In addition, the proposed research will result in the development of a ﬂexible statistical method to predict intervention mechanism effects in new target populations, taking into account population composition. Together, these contributions are anticipated to optimize targeting of future interventions to prevent drug abuse and addiction.",Mechanisms Underlying Differential Effects of Neighborhood Poverty on Problematic Adolescent Drug Use,9312260,K99DA042127,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Cities ', ' Conflict ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' abuses drugs ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' Drug abuse ', ' Drug Use Disorder ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Poverty ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Safety ', ' Schools ', ' Students ', ' Target Populations ', ' Testing ', ' Tweens ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Mediating ', ' base ', ' career ', ' method development ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Training ', ' residential site ', ' residence ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' bullying ', ' bully ', ' Hour ', ' Techniques ', ' novel ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Partner in relationship ', ' mate ', ' Prevention ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' boys ', ' girls ', ' Property ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' drug abuse prevention ', ' prevent drug use ', ' prevent drug addiction ', ' prevent drug abuse ', ' drug use prevention ', ' drug addiction prevention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Drug Addiction ', ' Drug Dependency ', ' Drug Dependence ', ' Chemical Dependence ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Subgroup ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' home visit ', ' House Call ', ' Home visitation ', ' cost ', ' youth drug use ', ' adolescent drug use ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' population based ', ' successful intervention ', ' intervention effect ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,K99,2017,153238,CA-13,0.054642957532102215
"Novel Accelerometer Calibration and Validation in Children andAdolescents Summary Accelerometers have been embraced by the scientific community as valid and reliable physical activity (PA) assessment tools. This is especially true in some sub-populations, such as children, who lack the ability to self- report their behaviors. Tremendous progress has been made in the objective assessment of PA and sedentary behavior (SB). Several measurement challenges remain that limit our ability to identify; dose-response associations with disease and risk factors, prevalence and determinants of these important health behaviors, changes in behavior due to time and intervention efforts. To overcome these challenges, we propose novel calibration procedures that will leverage the richness of three axes of raw acceleration data during free-living calibration activities, from wrist- and hip-worn accelerometers. Consistent with current PA recommendations for youth, the proposed study will focus on calibrating and validating accelerometer output to quantify intensity and duration of PA and identifying specific predominant modes of activity (e.g., sedentary time, locomotion, and fine/gross motor activity). Our primary goal is to follow best-practices data collection and analysis procedures to develop a comprehensive set of accelerometer algorithms that will accurately and precisely estimate minutes of various intensities of PA and mode of activity from hip- and wrist-worn accelerometers in children and adolescents (18 months to 21 years old), using video recorded direct observation during free-living activities as the criterion measure. Narrative Accurate and precise estimates of physical activity, sedentary behavior, and patterns of those behaviors in youth are essential in order to identify changes in those behaviors and to inform related policy decisions. The proposed research will extend previous accelerometer calibration studies by videotaping free-living activities in a large sample across a wide age range of children and adolescents. The raw acceleration signals from both hip- and wrist-worn devices will be analyzed using linear regression and machine learning methods to generate a family of freely available algorithms that produce accurate and precise estimates, reducing inconsistencies and confusion on use of previous accelerometer cutpoints in youth.",Novel Accelerometer Calibration and Validation in Children andAdolescents,9308944,R01DK110148,"['Acceleration ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Algorithms ', ' Behavior ', ' Calibration ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Communities ', ' Mental Confusion ', ' Confusional State ', ' Confusion ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Collection ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' artificial environment ', ' Controlled Environment ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Hip ', ' Coxa ', ' Hip region structure ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Linear Regressions ', ' Locomotion ', ' Methods ', ' Motor Activity ', ' Locomotor Activity ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Time ', ' Videotape ', ' Work ', ' Wrist ', ' Measures ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' sedentary ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Physical assessment ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Frequencies ', ' Pattern ', ' behavior change ', ' age group ', ' novel ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' Devices ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' computerized data processing ', ' data processing ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Output ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' 21 year old ', ' twenty-one years of age ', ' twenty-one year old ', ' age 21 years ', ' age 21 ', ' 21 years of age ', ' Health behavior change ', ' sedentary lifestyle ', ' Sedentary life-style ', ' Sedentary behavior ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' Accelerometer ', ' activity tracker ', ' activity monitor ', ' accelerometry ', ' Longitudinal cohort study ', ' Long-term cohort study ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST,R01,2017,339155,MA-02,0.03924871945760064
"ABCD-USA Consortium:Research Project ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period that is associated with dramatic increases in rates of substance use. Identifying predictors of substance use and its effects on child and adolescent development is critically important, as substance-related decrements incurred during ongoing maturation could have long- lasting effects on brain functioning and behavioral, health, and psychological outcomes. In response to RFA- DA-15-015, this application proposes the University of Pittsburgh Research Project Site component [12/13] of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD)-USA consortium to prospectively determine the neurodevelopmental and behavioral effects of substance on children and adolescents. In Pittsburgh, a representative community sample of 550 9-10 year old substance-naïve children will be recruited (total ABCD- USA n=11,111 from 11 total sites) and will undergo a baseline assessment and two to three follow-ups over a five year period. At each assessment period, participants will undergo state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, and extensive assessment of substance use patterns and mental health functioning. The brain, behavioral, psychological, social, genetic, and environmental data collected during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects o substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the ""gateway interactions"" between use of different substances. Elements Unique to This Site: In addition, ABCD-USA Pittsburgh will provide a unique focus determining how the cognitive dimensions of working memory and inhibitory control and the maturation of corticostriatal systems can inform our understanding of the risks for and effects of early adolescent marijuana use. Working memory and inhibitory control improve during adolescence in parallel with maturation of underlying corticostriatal neurocircuitry. An understanding of these areas of adolescent brain and cognitive development provide critical information in models determining vulnerabilities for and consequences of marijuana and other substance use. In Y03, Pittsburgh will focus on analyses examining working memory and inhibitory control phenotypes and neurodevelopmental characteristics prior to substance use. In Y04-Y05, these neurocognitive characteristics will be examined as risks for early adolescent marijuana use trajectories and, in Y10, accelerated adolescent marijuana use trajectories. Machine Learning will be applied to integrating cognitive and neuroimaging features to characterize a model of risks for early adolescent marijuana use. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ABCD-USA Consortium will use multimodal brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, mobile monitoring, and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning in 11,111 adolescents followed over 10 years to determine the effects of substance use on adolescent brain and cognitive development. Our 12/13 ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project will recruit and assess 550 youth age 9-10 at project entry.

"ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period associated with dramatic increases in rates of substance use. Identifying the pathways to substance use and its effects on child and adolescent development is critically important, as the effects of substance use during ongoing maturation likely have long-lasting effects on brain functioning and behavioral, health, and psychological outcomes. This Research Project Site application from the University of California, San Diego and Laureate Institute for Brain Research is in response to RFA-DA-15-015 as part of the ABCD-USA Consortium (5/13), to prospectively determine the neurodevelopmental and behavioral predictors and consequences of substance use on children and adolescents. A representative community sample of 1086 9-10 year olds enriched for high- risk characteristics will be recruited, contributing to the sample f 11,111 to be collected from 11 hubs across the ABCD- USA Consortium. All participants will undergo a comprehensive baseline assessment, including state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, bioassays, mobile monitoring and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning every 2 years. Interim annual interviews and quarterly web-based assessments will provide refined temporal resolution of behaviors, development, and life events with minimal participant burden. These Consortium-wide data obtained during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects of substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the ""gateway interactions"" between use of different substances. This hub's Research Project focuses on mechanisms of substance use disorder, special populations with high use prevalence, and the use of drugs other than marijuana. (1) We will determine whether individual differences in neural processing of antireward (i.e., negative reinforcement mechanisms) in amygdala, insula, and anterior cingulate are associated with increased negative emotionality and pain, predict initiation of use and problem use, and are in turn further dysregulated by substance use. (2) We will determine whether protective environment factors and ethnic identification in minority youth are linked to healthier antireward processing and better substance use outcomes. (3) We will determine whether antireward neural processing predicts increased use of illicit drugs other than MJ including misuse of prescription drugs, if such use predicts subsequent exaggerated antireward processing, and if gateway interactions exist between substances. Finally, we will use machine learning approaches to develop a youth-specific risk calculator that will enable us to identify individually- based modifiable risk factor, providing brain-based targets of future novel prevention and intervention approaches. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ABCD-USA Consortium will use multimodal brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, mobile monitoring, and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning in 11,111 adolescents followed over 10 years to determine the effects of substance use on adolescent brain and cognitive development.

"Using Administrative and Clinical Data to Detect Drug Use and HIV Risk in Foster Care USING ADMINISTRATIVE AND CLINICAL DATA TO DETECT DRUG USE AND HIV RISK IN FOSTER CARE Project Summary  The candidate's goal is to develop an independent research career as a developmental psychologist focused on identifying mechanisms to prevent the onset of pervasive and detrimental health risk behaviors, including substance abuse and HIV risk behaviors, among adolescents and young adults involved in foster care. She has experience in examining psychosocial and behavioral processes during this period of development and a strong publication record for the current phase in her career. Her previous training has emphasized development during adolescence and the transition to adulthood and health behaviors during this timeframe. In the K01, she proposes to expand her training to become an expert leader in team science approaches to address substance use and HIV risk behaviors during adolescence and the transition to adulthood, specifically focusing on foster youth, using child welfare administrative data and electronic medical records (EMR). Her training will emphasize: 1) development as an independent researcher and leader in interdisciplinary approaches to addressing health and development among foster youth, 2) substantive training in child maltreatment, substance use, and HIV risk behaviors, and 3) the use of machine learning to distinguish youth at risk, with the end goal of identifying opportunities for prevention. This will be accomplished through seminars and journal clubs offered at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC), attending regional and national conferences and trainings on substantive topics, and completion of coursework in child maltreatment and machine learning. Finally, she will complete coursework and seminars addressing the ethical conduct of research. Dr. Beal's goal is to submit an R01, as PI, during the third year of this grant.  CCHMC, one of the top three pediatric research hospitals in the nation, is committed to Dr. Beal's career development. The research environment at CCHMC and within the Division of Behavioral Medicine and Clinical Psychology, and the mentors and collaborators identified in this proposal, are well-suited to Dr. Beal's interests and research goals. Dr. Beal will be co-mentored by Dr. Jennie Noll and Dr. Robert Ammerman. Dr. Noll has extensive experience as a researcher examining the impact of child maltreatment on adolescent development, particularly around sexual risk behaviors. Dr. Ammerman is a well-established researcher with expertise in prevention and intervention programs for high-risk populations. Her advisory committee includes Dr. Melissa Jonson-Reid, an internationally recognized researcher in child welfare and the use of administrative records, Dr. John Schulenberg, developmental psychologist and authority in adolescent and young adult substance use, Dr. Jessica Kahn, expert in adolescent medicine and sexual and HIV risk behaviors, and Dr. John Pestian, leader in machine learning and its application to clinical care. These individuals have made a commitment to mentor and guide Dr. Beal in research and career development.  The objective of this research program is to fill a gap in our current understanding of which adolescents in foster care are at greatest risk for substance use and HIV while simultaneously providing a means for establishing Dr. Beal's independence as a researcher. There are two aims of this proposal. Aim 1 uses discrete time survival analyses and linked child welfare and EMR data to examine the onset and prevalence of substance use and HIV risk behaviors for youth ages 10-20 in foster care compared to matched Medicaid-eligible youth not in foster care (Foster care n=2836; 1-to-1 matched comparison from ~9585 primary care patients). Findings will provide estimates of the rates of substance use and HIV risk behaviors across ages 10-20 and when they increase/decrease, which is critical for identifying the ideal time to begin prevention and intervention efforts. Aim 2 will draw on causal inference techniques and machine learning to identify youth who are substance using or at substantial risk for developing HIV prior to age 21 based on two categories of risk factors: 1 – those common in adolescence, including parental substance use and mental health diagnoses; and 2 – risk factors unique to foster care, including extended time in foster care and placement instability. Analyses will be conducted using structural equation modeling to identify predictors of substance use and HIV risk behaviors. Machine learning will be used to develop classifiers that distinguish youth likely to use substances and contract HIV. This approach will, for the first time, provide a means to identify youth at risk for these negative health outcomes before youth experience these consequences. Via this approach, clinicians and front-line workers will be able to easily distinguish youth at risk and dedicate more time to prevention efforts. The proposed program of training and research will provide a clear pathway for Dr. Beal to transition as an independent researcher. This unique program of research merges her expertise in developmental science and health during adolescence and the transition to adulthood with research in child maltreatment, substance use, and HIV risk behaviors to support interdisciplinary, innovative team science approaches to prevent poor health outcomes among foster youth. The proposed studies in this application are significant because the findings take a developmental perspective to provide clinically useful information about which youth are at risk for poor health outcomes. Such an approach is innovative and will transform prevention delivery efforts for vulnerable foster youth. PROJECT NARRATIVE (PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE) Teens in foster care are at increased risk for substance abuse and contracting HIV compared to their peers, in addition to experiencing poor education, work, and psychosocial outcomes; leveraging administrative child welfare data linked to electronic medical records data for foster youth affords the opportunity to examine key factors that contribute to risk. The goal if this application is to identify youth at risk for substance abuse and HIV, with an eye toward designing intervention and prevention efforts that front-line workers and providers can enact for foster youth prior to age 18 to increase the likelihood that substance abuse and HIV in adulthood can be prevented. The concepts learned through this grant, as well as the career development pursued by the investigator, will be readily applicable to foster youth in child welfare and healthcare settings and could lead to innovations previously unachieved with this challenging and vulnerable adolescent population.",Using Administrative and Clinical Data to Detect Drug Use and HIV Risk in Foster

"ABCD-USA Consortium: Data Analysis Center ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ABCD-USA Consortium proposes a study designed to permit the scientific community to answer important questions about the effects of substance use (SU) patterns on behavioral and brain development of adolescents. We have assembled a team of investigators with unparalleled research experience with children and adolescents, and specific expertise in adolescent SU, child and adolescent development, developmental psychopathology, longitudinal multi-site imaging, developmental neuroimaging, developmental cognitive neuroscience, genetics and imaging genetics, bioassays, epidemiology, survey research, bioinformatics, and mobile assessment technologies. We propose a comprehensive, nationwide study to be conducted at 21 sites organized into 11 hubs (over 89 million Americans, 29% of the US population, live within 50 miles of our geographically spread sites), that, uniquely, can provide a nationally representative sample and a large twin sample that together can help distinguish environmental, sociocultural, and genetic factors relevant to SU. We ensure cohesion and standardization by employing a recruitment strategy designed by a professional survey company (experience with Monitoring the Future); standardized environmental, neurocognitive and mental health assessments, MRI assessments with all scanners using harmonized Human Connectome Project procedures, and computerized data collection with real-time quality control. Developmentally tailored assessments will have stable sensitivity and construct validity across the childhood and adolescent developmental period. They minimize participant burden, yet capture even subtle changes over time in substance use, mental health, neurocognition, development, and environment, and we employ novel state-of-the-art bioassays and passive data collection from mobile devices. A detailed retention plan builds on the experience and success of our investigators. This application describes the ABCD-USA Data Analysis and Informatics Center (DAIC), which will: establish a harmonized MRI acquisition protocol, compatible with all major scanner platforms, taking advantage of recent technological advances in structural and functional MRI; establish rigorous quality control and quantitative calibration procedures to ensure accuracy and comparability of derived imaging measures across scanners and across time; implement advanced computational analysis workflows for all imaging data; implement reliable data entry, quality control, and monitoring tools for the substance use questionnaire, neurocognitive assessments, bioassay-derived measures, and mobile technologies assessment data; implement the state- of-the-art statistical analysis tools and procedures needed to integrate information across measures and modalities; and implement infrastructure and procedures for public sharing of raw- and derived data and associated tools and computational workflows, and enable interactive data exploration and analytics through a web-based Portal.

"Impulsivity as Immaturity: Mapping Dysmaturation of the Brain's Control Architecture in Youth Externalizing Psychopathology ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Youth with externalizing psychopathologies, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and conduct disorder, present with diverse kinds of impulsivity symptoms, which in turn reflect deficits in regulatory control functioning. An emerging neurodevelopmental model, which we call the Impulsivity as Immaturity Model, could potentially transform our understanding of the brain basis of regulatory dysfunction. The brain's regulatory control architecture (RCA) undergoes massive maturation during childhood and adolescence. The Impulsivity as Immaturity Model proposes that aberrant maturation in distinct components of the RCA gives rise to distinct patterns of impulsivity symptoms-e.g., delayed maturation in certain attention control components gives rise to attentional variability, a specific form of attention dysfunction. Informed by this model, we will use a mixed cohort/longitudinal design enrolling 135 healthy youth and 135 youth with externalizing psychopathologies. Using advanced multivariate/multimodal analytic methods, we will map the normative neurodevelopmental trajectories of major components of the RCA including components involved in attention, motor, emotion, and appetitive control. We will then construct multivariate models that predict different forms of impulsivity based on neurodevelopment patterns of RCA components. Successful completion of this project will be a critical first step in development of a new class of imaging-based immaturity biomarkers that index distinct types of impulsivity irrespective of the specific externalizing disorders in which they manifest. This will lead to earlier, more reliable diagnosis of impulsivity problems in youth and spur the development of transdiagnostic, biologically based interventions that target specific forms of RCA dysmaturation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Using neuroimaging, we will map the development of key components of the brain's regulatory control architecture in a sample of youth with externalizing disorders and diverse kinds of impulsivity symptoms. We will use these maps to develop a new class of neuroimaging biomarkers for specific forms of impulsivity.

"Using Administrative and Clinical Data to Detect Drug Use and HIV Risk in Foster Care USING ADMINISTRATIVE AND CLINICAL DATA TO DETECT DRUG USE AND HIV RISK IN FOSTER CARE Project Summary  The candidate's goal is to develop an independent research career as a developmental psychologist focused on identifying mechanisms to prevent the onset of pervasive and detrimental health risk behaviors, including substance abuse and HIV risk behaviors, among adolescents and young adults involved in foster care. She has experience in examining psychosocial and behavioral processes during this period of development and a strong publication record for the current phase in her career. Her previous training has emphasized development during adolescence and the transition to adulthood and health behaviors during this timeframe. In the K01, she proposes to expand her training to become an expert leader in team science approaches to address substance use and HIV risk behaviors during adolescence and the transition to adulthood, specifically focusing on foster youth, using child welfare administrative data and electronic medical records (EMR). Her training will emphasize: 1) development as an independent researcher and leader in interdisciplinary approaches to addressing health and development among foster youth, 2) substantive training in child maltreatment, substance use, and HIV risk behaviors, and 3) the use of machine learning to distinguish youth at risk, with the end goal of identifying opportunities for prevention. This will be accomplished through seminars and journal clubs offered at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC), attending regional and national conferences and trainings on substantive topics, and completion of coursework in child maltreatment and machine learning. Finally, she will complete coursework and seminars addressing the ethical conduct of research. Dr. Beal's goal is to submit an R01, as PI, during the third year of this grant.  CCHMC, one of the top three pediatric research hospitals in the nation, is committed to Dr. Beal's career development. The research environment at CCHMC and within the Division of Behavioral Medicine and Clinical Psychology, and the mentors and collaborators identified in this proposal, are well-suited to Dr. Beal's interests and research goals. Dr. Beal will be co-mentored by Dr. Jennie Noll and Dr. Robert Ammerman. Dr. Noll has extensive experience as a researcher examining the impact of child maltreatment on adolescent development, particularly around sexual risk behaviors. Dr. Ammerman is a well-established researcher with expertise in prevention and intervention programs for high-risk populations. Her advisory committee includes Dr. Melissa Jonson-Reid, an internationally recognized researcher in child welfare and the use of administrative records, Dr. John Schulenberg, developmental psychologist and authority in adolescent and young adult substance use, Dr. Jessica Kahn, expert in adolescent medicine and sexual and HIV risk behaviors, and Dr. John Pestian, leader in machine learning and its application to clinical care. These individuals have made a commitment to mentor and guide Dr. Beal in research and career development.  The objective of this research program is to fill a gap in our current understanding of which adolescents in foster care are at greatest risk for substance use and HIV while simultaneously providing a means for establishing Dr. Beal's independence as a researcher. There are two aims of this proposal. Aim 1 uses discrete time survival analyses and linked child welfare and EMR data to examine the onset and prevalence of substance use and HIV risk behaviors for youth ages 10-20 in foster care compared to matched Medicaid-eligible youth not in foster care (Foster care n=2836; 1-to-1 matched comparison from ~9585 primary care patients). Findings will provide estimates of the rates of substance use and HIV risk behaviors across ages 10-20 and when they increase/decrease, which is critical for identifying the ideal time to begin prevention and intervention efforts. Aim 2 will draw on causal inference techniques and machine learning to identify youth who are substance using or at substantial risk for developing HIV prior to age 21 based on two categories of risk factors: 1 – those common in adolescence, including parental substance use and mental health diagnoses; and 2 – risk factors unique to foster care, including extended time in foster care and placement instability. Analyses will be conducted using structural equation modeling to identify predictors of substance use and HIV risk behaviors. Machine learning will be used to develop classifiers that distinguish youth likely to use substances and contract HIV. This approach will, for the first time, provide a means to identify youth at risk for these negative health outcomes before youth experience these consequences. Via this approach, clinicians and front-line workers will be able to easily distinguish youth at risk and dedicate more time to prevention efforts. The proposed program of training and research will provide a clear pathway for Dr. Beal to transition as an independent researcher. This unique program of research merges her expertise in developmental science and health during adolescence and the transition to adulthood with research in child maltreatment, substance use, and HIV risk behaviors to support interdisciplinary, innovative team science approaches to prevent poor health outcomes among foster youth. The proposed studies in this application are significant because the findings take a developmental perspective to provide clinically useful information about which youth are at risk for poor health outcomes. Such an approach is innovative and will transform prevention delivery efforts for vulnerable foster youth. PROJECT NARRATIVE (PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE) Teens in foster care are at increased risk for substance abuse and contracting HIV compared to their peers, in addition to experiencing poor education, work, and psychosocial outcomes; leveraging administrative child welfare data linked to electronic medical records data for foster youth affords the opportunity to examine key factors that contribute to risk. The goal if this application is to identify youth at risk for substance abuse and HIV, with an eye toward designing intervention and prevention efforts that front-line workers and providers can enact for foster youth prior to age 18 to increase the likelihood that substance abuse and HIV in adulthood can be prevented. The concepts learned through this grant, as well as the career development pursued by the investigator, will be readily applicable to foster youth in child welfare and healthcare settings and could lead to innovations previously unachieved with this challenging and vulnerable adolescent population.",Using Administrative and Clinical Data to Detect Drug Use and HIV Risk in Foster

"Effects of Functional Food Diets on Cardiometabolic and Metabolomics Profiles in Minority Youth PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT This proposal outlines a career development plan to help Dr. Jaapna Dhillon complete her postdoctoral training and establish an independent research program focused on personalized dietary interventions to reduce cardiometabolic risk in minority populations. Her training will be conducted in a multidisciplinary group of scientists with research expertise in nutrition science, health disparities, molecular cell biology, metabolomics and computational biology. Her advisory team will provide an outstanding training environment that will allow her to fill critical gaps in her toolkit needed to use an integrative and personalized approach to nutrition. This award will enhance her knowledge in developing culturally sensitive nutrition interventions and cardiovascular physiology, and provide advanced training in metabolomics and computational biology. During the training phase of this award, she will strengthen her scholarly activities, establish important collaborations, and acquire critical data that will ensure her successful transition to independence. Rational: The incidence of diet-related cardiometabolic disorders is increasing at an alarming rate in racial/ethnic minority groups such as Asians and Hispanics, and are much higher than Non-Hispanic Whites in the United States. [8]. However, whether improvements in diet quality will influence minority groups at high risk of cardiometabolic diseases differentially than Whites at high risk is not well understood. Functional foods such as nuts, whole grains and vegetables can help ameliorate cardiovascular disease and reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. However, most studies on functional foods and health have been overwhelmingly performed in middle-aged to older non-Hispanic White adults, with young minority populations being greatly neglected. Adapting a functional food diet at earlier life stages may prevent or ameliorate metabolic disorders later in life in minority populations that are at greater risk for developing chronic metabolic diseases. Our central hypothesis is that adapting a personalized functional food diet at earlier life stages will have greater beneficial effects on carbohydrate and lipid regulation pathways in minority youth at risk for developing cardiometabolic disorders compared to White youth at risk. Design: The mentored phase study will 1) examine the effects of almonds on blood glucose regulation pathways using metabolomics techniques and 2) provide preliminary data for the development and testing of a model that can predict effects of almonds on metabolic consequences in minority youth. The independent phase study will evaluate the long term effects of a personalized diet rich in functional foods on pathways of carbohydrate and lipid regulation in relation to the gut microbiome and cardiovascular outcomes in minority youth at high risk for cardiometabolic disorders. Relevance: The proposed studies will provide an initial evidence base for the health benefits of personalized functional food interventions in minority youth. This innovative dietary strategy may be more effective at reducing risk and ameliorating diet-related cardiometabolic disorders than conventional dietary advice in this population.

"Adolescent Brain Bases of Intergenerational Risk for Depression Project Summary Adolescence is a critical time for understanding Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) because nearly half of lifetime diagnoses of psychiatric disorders begin by age 14. Further, intergenerational risk for depression (RISK; having a parent with MDD) increases adolescent likelihood of developing MDD by three- to five-fold. The goal of this research is to understand adolescent neural factors associated with RISK and to characterize the neurodevelopmental path of RISK adolescents. The proposed research adds to an ongoing NIMH grant (U01MH108168) that compares brain function and structure between adolescents (ages 14-15) with MDD and adolescents without MDD/intergenerational risk for MDD (CON). I propose to add a new group of adolescents who are at intergenerational risk for depression (RISK) to address the following aims. First, I aim to dissociate functional and structural neural differences between risk (traits) and clinical diagnosis (state) of adolescent MDD. I will recruit and characterize 120 age- and sex-matched adolescents (ages 14-15): 40 adolescents at RISK for depression but without a personal history of MDD (RISK), 40 adolescents without RISK and no history of MDD (CON), and 40 adolescents with current MDD. I will perform (a) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), (b) structural MRI (sMRI), and (c) diffusion MRI (dMRI). Second, I aim to discover neurodevelopmental differences associated with RISK. I will re-characterize and re-scan RISK and CON adolescents two years after initial scanning. I will assess differences in functional and structural neurodevelopment between RISK and CON adolescents over this two-year period. I will also assess the extent to which RISK-associated neurodevelopmental changes in brain function and structure are related to development of depressive symptoms. Third, I aim to discover whether multimodal baseline measures predict progression of depressive symptoms in RISK adolescents. All 120 adolescents will undergo extensive clinical and neural characterization at study enrollment, and will undergo follow-up clinical examinations every six months for two years post- enrollment. I will determine whether behavioral and/or brain measures at enrollment predict the subsequent progression of depressive symptoms over this two-year period. The proposed research would be the first to: 1) dissociate functional and structural brain differences between RISK, MDD, and CON adolescents, 2) determine neurodevelopmental changes in RISK compared to CON adolescents, and 3) provide precise biological prediction of the development of depressive symptomology in at-risk adolescents. Knowledge gained from this study will provide a new understanding of the neural underpinning of both risk and developed depression in adolescence, as well as provide valuable contribution toward early prevention of MDD. Project Narrative Children of depressed parents are at increased risk for substance abuse, psychiatric disorders, and decreased social and scholastic functioning. The goal of this research is to understand adolescent neural factors associated with familial risk for depression and to characterize the neurodevelopmental path of these adolescents. We will use advanced behavioral and neuroimaging techniques to understand how developmental changes in the brain are implicated in developmental changes in depressive symptoms in adolescents at familial risk for depression.",Adolescent Brain Bases of Intergenerational Risk for Depression,9568354,F32MH114525,"['Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdala ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Facial Expression ', ' face expression ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Moods ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Parents ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Measures ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' career ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Training ', ' Early Intervention ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' Depressed mood ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Psychiatric Diagnosis ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scanning ', ' Techniques ', ' Dyslexia ', ' Word Blindness ', ' intergenerational ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Neural Development ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' white matter ', ' substantia alba ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Deterioration ', ' Modeling ', ' brain volume ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' dMRI ', ' Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Diffusion weighted imaging ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' DWI-MRI ', ' DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' major depression disorder ', ' major depression ', ' clinical depression ', ' Address ', ' Base of the Brain ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Validation ', ' sex ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' feelings ', ' Feeling ', ' Behavioral ', ' Behavioral Assay ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' youth depression ', ' pediatric depression ', ' depression in adolescence ', ' depressed adolescents ', ' childhood onset depression ', ' childhood depression ', ' adolescents with depression ', ' adolescent depression ', ' child depression ', ' Affective ', ' multimodality ', ' Social Anxiety Disorder ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,F32,2018,58654,MA-07,0.10494037892471265
"Positive Valence Systems and Manic Symptom Trajectories in Adolescent Depression PROJECT SUMMARY Depression is a heterogeneous condition with varying degrees of severity and different etiologies that contrib- ute to variability in course trajectory and psychosocial functioning. About a third of adolescents with depression exhibit manic symptoms and as such, this substantially increases the risk for psychosocial impairment and sui- cidality. Yet, few studies have examined the pathophysiology of manic symptoms in adolescent depression and how alterations in key neural systems may be associated with changes in emotional, cognitive, and behavioral functioning. This project will address this important gap by employing a dimensional approach and a longitudi- nal design to examine neural, emotional, cognitive, and behavioral substrates of manic symptoms in (non- bipolar) depressed adolescents. Given evidence that manic symptoms implicate dysregulation of emotion and behavior, the current project will test the overarching hypothesis that alterations in connectivity of fronto- striatal-limbic (FSL) circuitry underlying cognitive control of positive emotion and reward and associated altera- tions in RDoC domain-related (emotional, cognitive, behavioral) measures of functioning in Cognitive and Posi- tive Valence Systems could differentiate depressed adolescents with from those without co-occurring manic symptoms. We aim to test this model in a longitudinal study of 180 mid-/post-pubertal adolescents (12-17 years old), including 140 adolescents with clinically significant depressive symptoms varying in manic symp- toms and 40 age- and sex- matched healthy youth. In accordance with the NIMH RDoC initiative, all depressed adolescents will be recruited from treatment settings based on the presence of clinically significant depression symptoms, irrespective of their categorical depressive disorder diagnosis. The project includes at baseline: a) fMRI paradigms measuring functioning of FSL circuitry associated with cognitive control of positive emotion and reward, b) resting state and diffusion tensor imaging, and c) out-of-the scanner neurocognitive tasks (e.g., approach-avoidance). RDoC domain-related emotional (e.g., elated mood), cognitive (e.g., delay discounting), and behavioral (e.g., impulsivity) functioning and levels of arousal will be assessed using a multi-method ap- proach (e.g., computer tasks in the lab and ecologically-valid web-based mood and actigraphy measures) at baseline and repeated bi-annually over 2 years post-scan. In addition, using machine learning algorithms, ex- ploratory analyses will be performed to identify patterns of baseline neuroimaging data and trajectories of RDoC domain-related (emotional, cognitive, behavioral) measures that can predict levels of mood symptoms and functional impairment at 2 years. Findings from this study could help distinguish subgroups of depressed adolescents based on brain-behavioral relationships, improve early detection of manic symptoms in depressed youth, and inform personalized interventions (e.g., antidepressant vs. mood-stabilizer, type of psychotherapy). PROJECT NARRATIVE Early identification of manic symptoms (e.g., impulsive and risk taking behavior, mood lability) and its trajectories can decrease the huge and chronic burden of depressive disorders on youth, families, and society. This pro- posed longitudinal study has the potential to identify neural and behavioral markers of manic symptoms in de- pressed adolescents (without bipolar disorder). Identifying such markers has important clinical implications such as improving early detection of manic symptoms in depressed youth and informing personalized interventions for depression with mixed features (e.g., antidepressant versus mood-stabilizer or tailoring psychotherapeutic ap- proaches).  ",Positive Valence Systems and Manic Symptom Trajectories in Adolescent

"ABCD-USA Consortium:Research Project DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period that is associated with dramatic increases in rates of substance use. Identifying predictors of substance use and its effects on child and adolescent development is critically important, as substance-related decrements incurred during ongoing maturation could have long- lasting effects on brain functioning and behavioral, health, and psychological outcomes. In response to RFA- DA-15-015, this application proposes the University of Pittsburgh Research Project Site component [12/13] of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD)-USA consortium to prospectively determine the neurodevelopmental and behavioral effects of substance on children and adolescents. In Pittsburgh, a representative community sample of 550 9-10 year old substance-naïve children will be recruited (total ABCD- USA n=11,111 from 11 total sites) and will undergo a baseline assessment and two to three follow-ups over a five year period. At each assessment period, participants will undergo state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, and extensive assessment of substance use patterns and mental health functioning. The brain, behavioral, psychological, social, genetic, and environmental data collected during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects o substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the ""gateway interactions"" between use of different substances. Elements Unique to This Site: In addition, ABCD-USA Pittsburgh will provide a unique focus determining how the cognitive dimensions of working memory and inhibitory control and the maturation of corticostriatal systems can inform our understanding of the risks for and effects of early adolescent marijuana use. Working memory and inhibitory control improve during adolescence in parallel with maturation of underlying corticostriatal neurocircuitry. An understanding of these areas of adolescent brain and cognitive development provide critical information in models determining vulnerabilities for and consequences of marijuana and other substance use. In Y03, Pittsburgh will focus on analyses examining working memory and inhibitory control phenotypes and neurodevelopmental characteristics prior to substance use. In Y04-Y05, these neurocognitive characteristics will be examined as risks for early adolescent marijuana use trajectories and, in Y10, accelerated adolescent marijuana use trajectories. Machine Learning will be applied to integrating cognitive and neuroimaging features to characterize a model of risks for early adolescent marijuana use. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ABCD-USA Consortium will use multimodal brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, mobile monitoring, and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning in 11,111 adolescents followed over 10 years to determine the effects of substance use on adolescent brain and cognitive development. Our 12/13 ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project will recruit and assess 550 youth age 9-10 at project entry. In addition to contributions to the overall consortium, our U01 will specifically focus on the effects of adolescent marijuana use on working memory, inhibitory control and corticostriatal systems.",ABCD-USA Consortium:Research Project,9509388,U01DA041028,"['Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Development ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Cognition ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Institutes ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Marijuana ', ' marihuana ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' working memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methodology ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neuropsychological Tests ', ' Neuropsychologic Tests ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Phenotype ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Standardization ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Technology ', ' Universities ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' improved ', ' brain visualization ', ' Brain imaging ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' non-human primate ', ' nonhuman primate ', ' Logistics ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Genetic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' cognitive function ', ' Dimensions ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' Services ', ' misuse of prescription only drugs ', ' prescription misuse ', ' prescription drug misuse ', ' nonmedical prescription drug use ', ' non-medical prescription drug use ', ' Prescription medication misuse ', ' experience ', ' Informatics ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' Participant ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' Modality ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' neural circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Adolescent Development ', ' behavioral health ', ' response ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Program Research Project Grants ', ' Research Program Projects ', ' Program Project Grant ', ' P01 Program ', ' P01 Mechanism ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Cognitive ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' early onset ', ' youth substance use ', ' substance use among youth ', ' substance use among adolescents ', ' adolescent substance use ', ' time use ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Social Functioning ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Outcome ', ' psychological outcomes ', ' prospective ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' ten years of age ', ' ten year old ', ' age 10 years ', ' 10 years of age ', ' 10 year old ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' multimodality ', ' early adulthood ', ' emerging adult ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' cognitive testing ', ' marijuana use in adolescence ', ' marijuana use among adolescents ', ' cannabis use among adolescents ', ' Adolescent marijuana use ', ' cognitive task ', ' cognitive development ', ' cannabis use ', ' THC use ', ' THC co-use ', ' marijuana use ', ' Department chair ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' translational research program ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,U01,2018,990000,PA-18,0.1569534731786847

"Delineating neurobiological heterogeneity in internalizing symptoms using machine learning and deep phenotyping ABSTRACT  Symptom-based classification approaches based on the DSM 5 are often not supported by epidemiological, genetic, and clinical neuroimaging research and may impede the advancement of interventions that target the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying mental health disorders. A novel alternative to classifying psychopathology based on presenting clinical symptoms is to identify neurobiologically-informed biotypes. Individuals are clustered according to shared patterns of brain dysfunction using data-driven machine learning techniques to reveal the heterogeneous biological mechanisms that underlie comorbid disorders. Internalizing symptoms often first begin during development, suggesting that this is a critical period of vulnerability. Additionally, strong sex differences are found in anxiety and depressive symptoms, starting in adolescence. Thus, studies are needed that examine sex differences in the neurobiological mechanisms associated with internalizing symptoms during development. The purpose of the current study is to uncover the neurobiological heterogeneity associated with internalizing symptoms in youth. During the K99 phase, Aim 1 will use machine-learning techniques to delineate patterns of neurobiological heterogeneity among youth with anxiety and depressive disorders using multimodal neuroimaging data from a large community-based sample of over 1,200 youth studied as part of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC; Training phase). We will test these heterogeneous patterns on a hold-out sample from the same cohort to examine the model’s validity (Validation phase). While the PNC provides an ideal dataset for developing a model, it does not have paradigms relevant to fear and anxiety that would allow us to identify important phenotypic differences between biotypes. Thus, Aim 2 will evaluate the generalizability of this model in an independent sample collected during the R00 phase, and further characterize these biotypes using pertinent measures related to error and reward processing. Finally, Aim 3 will investigate how sex differences in brain development associate with heterogeneous neural patterns in internalizing symptoms. Dr. Kaczkurkin’s long-term goal is to establish an independent research program where she will use advanced multi-modal neuroimaging techniques to study the mechanisms underlying internalizing disorders in youth. This study will provide a unique opportunity to capitalize on the PNC database at the University of Pennsylvania to develop a well-validated model while also collecting a refined independent dataset, which will provide Dr. Kaczkurkin with the training and experience needed to transition to an independent research career. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study will provide critical knowledge regarding the neurobiological heterogeneity in youth with mood and anxiety disorders. A greater comprehension of how abnormalities in brain function give rise to these symptoms in adolescence is critical for the development of earlier and more effective treatments. Such knowledge would benefit public health by reducing the costs and burden of internalizing symptoms on the society at large. !",Delineating neurobiological heterogeneity in internalizing symptoms using machine learning and deep phenotyping,9583383,K99MH117274,"['Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Anxiety ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Arousal ', ' Attention ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Cerebrovascular Circulation ', ' cerebrovascular blood flow ', ' cerebrocirculation ', ' cerebral circulation ', ' cerebral blood flow ', ' brain blood flow ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communities ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Depressive disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Female ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' male ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Philadelphia ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Sex Characteristics ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Societies ', ' Supervision ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Comprehension ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Age of Onset ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Funding ', ' Generalized Anxiety Disorder ', ' Genetic ', ' Atrophic ', ' Atrophy ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' novel ', ' Categories ', ' Modality ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' DSM-V ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-V ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition ', ' DSM5 ', ' DSM-5 ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Multimodal Imaging ', ' multimodality imaging ', ' multi-modality imaging ', ' Cognitive ', ' Validation ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cost ', ' Affective ', ' reward processing ', ' neurobiological mechanism ', ' critical period ', ' multimodality ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' neural patterning ', ' anxious symptom ', ' anxiety symptoms ', ' anxious ', ' Phobias ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' dysfunctional brain ', ' brain dysfunction ', ' psychiatric symptom ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K99,2018,109900,PA-03,0.050447083520375545
"Using Adolescent Nonverbal Behavior to Predict Aggression Against Bullies and Bystanders PROJECT SUMMARY Aggression linked to peer-based rejection and bullying is a leading cause of injury and psychological distress among middle school-aged adolescents, and occurs at higher rates in youth exposed to harsh parenting. Tradi- tional intervention programs that target those at risk for perpetrating aggression due to harsh parenting have had only limited success. This lack of success may be due to the fact that aggression is the product of complex decision-making processes that are influenced by current states of attention, arousal, and affect. A different approach is to prevent aggression before it happens by interceding when nonverbal indices signal a shift in these critical states. An essential first step towards establishing this prevention-based approach is to isolate nonverbal behavior that reliably predicts forthcoming aggression in high-risk adolescents. Eye gaze, pupillary dilation, and facial expressions are strong nonverbal behavioral candidates given that they are well-established indices of attention, arousal, and affective states. The current proposal uses computational modeling to test the predictive link between these nonverbal behaviors elicited during an ecologically valid social rejection paradigm and subsequent expression of peer-based aggression in adolescents (11-14 years; N=80) with high and low exposure to harsh parenting. Results will lay the groundwork for our long-term objective, to develop next gen- eration interventions aimed at preventing aggression the moment its behavioral precursors are detected. PROJECT NARRATIVE Aggression linked to peer-based rejection and bullying is a costly public health problem that is inadequately addressed by existing interventions. The goal of this project is to implement computational modeling to predict aggression in low and high-risk youth using nonverbal behavior elicited during social rejection and aggression- related decision-making. Next generation interventions can then be designed to prevent aggression when these nonverbal indices are detected.",Using Adolescent Nonverbal Behavior to Predict Aggression Against Bullies and Bystanders,9791513,R21HD093912,"['Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Affect ', ' Aggressive behavior ', ' Aggression ', ' Anger ', ' angry ', ' angers ', ' Arousal ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Rearing ', ' childrearing ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' Parenting ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computers ', ' Decision Making ', ' Exhibits ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye Movements ', ' Eyelid structure ', ' Palpebra ', ' Eyelids ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Facial Expression ', ' face expression ', ' Facial Muscles ', ' Goals ', ' indexing ', ' Learning ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Lip structure ', ' Lip ', ' male ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Noise ', ' Public Health ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Schools ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Testing ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' school age ', ' School-Age Population ', ' Exposure to ', ' Blast Cell ', ' Hemohistioblast ', ' Hemocytoblast ', ' Hematohistioblast ', ' Ferrata cell ', ' Blasts ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' bullying ', ' bully ', ' Physical aggression ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' psychosocial ', ' gaze ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' physical model ', ' intervention program ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' psychological distress ', ' Modeling ', ' boys ', ' response ', ' junior high school ', ' middle school ', ' junior high ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Process ', ' Fixation ', ' sample fixation ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' virtual ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' next generation ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' fourteen years of age ', ' fourteen year old ', ' age 14 years ', ' 14 years of age ', ' 14 year old ', ' Affective ', ' high risk ', ' prevent aggression ', ' aggression prevention ', ' attentional bias ', ' high-risk adolescents ', ' secondary analysis ', ' predictive assay ', ' predictive test ', ' ']",NICHD,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,R21,2018,232781,PA-02,0.0827950844957562
"PAGES: Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site Project Summary Physical activity (PA) prevents or ameliorates a large number of diseases, and inactivity is the 4th leading global mortality risk factor. The molecular mechanisms responsible for the diverse benefits of PA are not well understood. The Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) is being formed to advance knowledge in this area. We propose to establish PAGES, a Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site as an integral component of the MoTrPAC. PAGES will conduct comprehensive analyses of the rat and human PA intervention MoTrPAC samples, contribute these data to public databases, help identify candidate molecular transducers of PA and elucidate new PA response mechanisms, and help develop predictive models of the individual response to PA. PAGES assay sites at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York Genome Center and Broad Institute provide the infrastructure, expertise and experience to support this large scale, comprehensive analysis of molecular changes associated with PA. PAGES aims are to 1. Work with the MoTrPAC Steering Committee in Year 1 to finalize plans and protocols; 2. Perform assays and analyses to help Identify candidate molecular transducers of the response to PA in rat models and the pathways responsible for model differences, including high-depth RNA-seq and Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS), supplemented by additional assay types such as ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq based on initial results; 3. Perform comprehensive assays and analyses of the human MoTrPAC clinical study tissue samples, including RNA-seq, WGBS, H3K27ac ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq and whole genome sequencing. 4. Collaborate with the MoTrPAC to analyze data from PAGES and other MoTrPAC analysis sites to identify candidate PA transducers and molecular mechanisms, and to develop predictive models of PA capacity and response to training. The success of PAGES and the MoTrPAC program will transform insight into the molecular networks that transduce PA into health, create an unparalleled comprehensive public PA data resource, and can provide the foundation for profound advances in the prevention and treatment of many major human diseases. Project Narrative While physical activity prevents or improves a large number of diseases, the chemical changes that occur in the body and lead to better health are not well known.

"Course and Outcome of Bipolar Disorder in Youth ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Course and Outcome of Bipolar Disorders in Youth (COBY) study has comprehensively characterized the clinical course of a large sample of youth with bipolar disorder (BD), and has identified demographic and clinical factors that are associated with different illness courses. To date, however, COBY has not included neuroimaging assessments. Including such assessments now will allow, for the first time, an evaluation of the impact of 13-year course of BD and treatment upon neural circuitry function and structure. Furthermore, the majority of COBY participants are currently between 18-30 years old, when the brain, and prefrontal cortex in particular, continues to develop. Including neuroimaging assessments in COBY participants now can thus take advantage of the neurodevelopmental processes occurring between 18-30 years where there are unique opportunities to intervene therapeutically to help normalize abnormalities in neural functioning and structure. Focusing on this age range will also provide a critically important opportunity to determine the extent to which neuroimaging measures predict future clinical course in adulthood. Having normal prefrontal cortical function and structure may predict better clinical course in adulthood, even in COBY participants with poor clinical course in youth, and may lead to decisions to reduce, or even stop, specific treatments in these individuals. In the proposed study, we will determine how previous BD clinical course (e.g., % time with mood symptoms vs. euthymic; % time with comorbid disorders) and treatment exposure from childhood into adulthood impacts neural circuitry functioning and structure supporting key NIMH RDoC information processing domains, and compare neuroimaging findings in COBY participants with those of demographically-matched healthy controls (Aim 1). We will also determine whether neuroimaging measures predict illness course in adulthood, beyond demographic and clinical factors, and previous clinical course in youth (Aim 2). We will use machine learning to explore patterns of wholebrain functioning, white and gray matter structure, and clinical and demographic measures, that most accurately predict future clinical course at the individual subject level. The proposed study also provides a valuable opportunity to inform the field regarding the clinical and functional course and outcome from youth into adulthood in a large, well-characterized sample of people with BD. This is important because the clinical outcome of BD youth in adulthood remains uncertain, as only two studies with a total of 72 subjects followed BD youth into their early twenties. Structural and functional neuroimaging techniques will be employed in a representative subsample of COBY participants (n=120), and healthy controls (n=50). Comprehensive assessments of psychopathology and functioning will be collected at the time of neuroimaging, and twice more during the proposed project period in the 120 COBY participants. This proposal accords with the NIMH's mission to define developmental trajectories of mental disorders and develop strategies to better define risk and protective factors for disease trajectories across the lifespan, and with the RDoC initiative. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The aim of the proposed study is to identify the impact of long-term previous clinical course and treatment on the brain in individuals with childhood-onset bipolar disorder, and examine how these changes in the brain influence future clinical course during adulthood. The participants are currently between 18-30 years old when the brain begins to achieve full maturity. Thus, this study will provide a unique opportunity to determine the extent to which neuroimaging measures predict future clinical course during an important neurodevelopmental period in individuals with bipolar disorder and can yield findings that will aid treatment decisions for these individuals.",Course and Outcome of Bipolar Disorder in Youth,9428459,R01MH059929,"['Accounting ', ' Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdala ', ' Anxiety ', ' Arousal ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Future ', ' gray matter ', ' substantia grisea ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hippocampus ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Literature ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Mission ', ' Moods ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Rest ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' Medial ', ' Clinical ', ' Fiber ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' disorder onset ', ' disease onset ', ' Onset of illness ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' psychosocial ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Structure ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' Participant ', ' white matter ', ' substantia alba ', ' Neurophysiology - biologic function ', ' neural function ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Ventral Striatum ', ' neural circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' Emotional ', ' Sampling ', ' Symptoms ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' positive emotion ', ' positive emotional state ', ' Outcome ', ' Impact evaluation ', ' early therapy ', ' Early treatment ', ' reward processing ', ' cognitive control ', ' critical period ', ' information processing ', ' public health relevance ', ' multimodality ', ' neural patterning ', ' RDoC ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' Positive Valence ', ' Negative Valence ', ' symptomatology ', ' symptom comorbidity ', ' symptom association ', ' cooccuring symptom ', ' concurrent symptom ', ' comorbid symptom ', ' associated symptom ', ' mood symptom ', ' clinical imaging ', ' protective factors ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,643008,PA-18,0.06677565500068593
"ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period associated with dramatic increases in rates of substance use. Identifying the pathways to substance use and its effects on child and adolescent development is critically important, as the effects of substance use during ongoing maturation likely have long-lasting effects on brain functioning and behavioral, health, and psychological outcomes. This Research Project Site application from the University of California, San Diego and Laureate Institute for Brain Research is in response to RFA-DA-15-015 as part of the ABCD-USA Consortium (5/13), to prospectively determine the neurodevelopmental and behavioral predictors and consequences of substance use on children and adolescents. A representative community sample of 1086 9-10 year olds enriched for high-risk characteristics will be recruited, contributing to the sample of 11,111 to be collected from 11 hubs across the ABCD-USA Consortium. All participants will undergo a comprehensive baseline assessment, including state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, bioassays, mobile monitoring and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning every 2 years. Interim annual interviews and quarterly web-based assessments will provide refined temporal resolution of behaviors, development, and life events with minimal participant burden. These Consortium-wide data obtained during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects of substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the “gateway interactions” between use of different substances. This hub’s Research Project focuses on mechanisms of substance use disorder, special populations with high use prevalence, and the use of drugs other than marijuana. (1) We will determine whether individual differences in neural processing of antireward (i.e., negative reinforcement mechanisms) in amygdala, insula, and anterior cingulate are associated with increased negative emotionality and pain, predict initiation of use and problem use, and are in turn further dysregulated by substance use. (2) We will determine whether protective environment factors and ethnic identification in minority youth are linked to healthier antireward processing and better substance use outcomes. (3) We will determine whether antireward neural processing predicts increased use of illicit drugs other than MJ including misuse of prescription drugs, if such use predicts subsequent exaggerated antireward processing, and if gateway interactions exist between substances. Finally, we will use machine learning approaches to develop a youth-specific risk calculator that will enable us to identify individually-based modifiable risk factors, providing brain-based targets of future novel prevention and intervention approaches.

"Novel Approaches for Predicting Unstructured Short Periods of Physical Activities in Youth ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The use of accelerometers for the measurement of physical activity in youth has increased substantially over the last decade. Accelerometers are typically worn on the waist, however recently alternative placement sites such as the wrist have become more popular. For example, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is currently using the wrist location for their accelerometer physical activity measurements. Currently there is a lack of information about best approaches for analyzing accelerometer data from the wrist location with the ActiGraph accelerometer. In addition, advances in accelerometer technology allow for utilization of the raw acceleration signal with machine learning algorithms, which have the capability to predict activities and improve the estimates of energy expenditure over previously used methods. Members of this research group have shown improved activity classification and energy expenditure prediction in youth using Bipart, versus commonly used approaches such as Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machine. However, this preliminary work was based on accelerometer count data and structured lab activities with only a hip worn accelerometer. In addition, there are limitations to applying lab based models to true free-living activity. For example, free-living activity is not performed in structured bouts rather it is performed in micro-bouts over the course of the day which is problematic for methods designed to look at a string of data over a specified time period. There is minimal work currently on how to first segment bouts of free-living activity before classifying activity type and predicting energy expenditure. This proposal will extend our previous work using more advanced methods to analyze raw acceleration data (80 Hz) using a single wrist or hip worn accelerometer. One hundred youth will be measured during a semi-structured simulated free-living period (development group) and 200 youth will be measured during true free-living activity during an after-school program and at home (validation group). Measurements will include indirect calorimetry for energy expenditure and direct observation for activity type. The specific aims of the study are to: 1) develop and validate machine learning algorithms to segment bouts of activity during free-living activity in youth using: A) a hip worn accelerometer or B) a wrist worn accelerometer, and 2) develop and validate machine learning algorithms to classify physical activity type and estimate energy expenditure in youth, during free-living activity using: A) a hip worn accelerometer or B) a wrist worn accelerometer. Results from these studies will have direct and immediate impact for physical activity researchers utilizing accelerometers as well as analysis of NHANES wrist accelerometer data by providing ac- curate and precise methods for bout segmentation, prediction of activity type and energy expenditure.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop and validate machine learning algorithms using raw accelerometer data collected at the hip or wrist for use in youth. These algorithms will be able to detect the start and end times of free-living physical activity bouts, classify the type of activity being performed, and estimate energy expenditure, significantly improving upon current methods. These algorithms will have direct benefit to those examining dose response relationships between sedentary behaviors, physical activity and health outcomes in youth, in the physical activity and public health fields.            ",Novel Approaches for Predicting Unstructured Short Periods of Physical Activities in Youth,9464374,R01HD083431,"['Acceleration ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Algorithms ', ' Behavior ', ' Indirect Calorimetry ', ' Respiration Calorimetry ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Data Sources ', ' Energy Metabolism ', ' Energy Expenditure ', ' Environment ', ' Hip region structure ', ' Hip ', ' Coxa ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Methods ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Noise ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Sleep ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Wrist ', ' Measures ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ', ' NHANES ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Location ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Prevention ', ' after-school program ', ' afterschool program ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' model development ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Collection ', ' Validation ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Source Code ', ' obesity treatment ', ' time use ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' eighteen years of age ', ' eighteen year old ', ' age 18 years ', ' 18 years of age ', ' 18 year old ', ' public health relevance ', ' data reduction ', ' Sedentary life-style ', ' Sedentary behavior ', ' sedentary lifestyle ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' activity tracker ', ' activity monitor ', ' accelerometry ', ' Accelerometer ', ' artificial neural network ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE KNOXVILLE,R01,2018,470142,TN-02,0.07051780226674631

"Pattern Analysis of fMRI via machine learning/sparse models: application to brain development Abstract Resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) provides reproducible, task-independent biomarkers of coherent functional activity linking different brain regions. The main goal of the proposed project is to leverage advances in signal processing and machine learning methods to derive clinically useful biomarkers based on patterns of functional connectivity, and to test these biomarkers in a large study of brain development. Central to our methodology are 1) computing a subject-specific functional parcellation of the brain, which defines nodes for characterizing individualized functional brain networks; 2) extracting sparse connectivity patterns for robustly representing brain networks; 3) capturing heterogeneity in brain networks across individuals in a given population; and 4) deriving individualized predictive indices of psychosis risk from brain connectivity in a large study of brain development. This novel suite of functional connectivity analysis tools will be developed and validated based on data from the Human Connectome Project and the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC). Finally, these techniques will be applied to PNC data in order to delineate heterogeneity in network development in youth with psychosis-spectrum symptoms. Our hypothesis is that patterns of functional connectivity in adolescents with psychosis-spectrum symptoms will be different from those in typically developing adolescents, and this difference will display a high degree of heterogeneity that is linked to underlying heterogeneity in pathologic neurodevelopmental trajectories. Moreover, we expect that machine learning techniques will allow us to predict on an individual basis which adolescents with psychosis-spectrum symptoms will remain stable, which will revert to normal, and which will progress to psychosis, based on their baseline functional connectivity signatures. Our methods are generally applicable to rsfMRI studies for detecting and quantifying spatio-temporal functional connectivity patterns in diverse fields, including diagnosing brain abnormalities in neuropsychiatric diseases, and finding associations of functional connectivity with different cognitive functions. All methods will be made publicly available and form an important new resource for the broader neuroscience community. Project narrative This proposal develops a suite of advanced functional imaging pattern analysis methods, aiming to delineate heterogeneity in brain network development in youth with psychosis-spectrum symptoms, ultimately leading to early biomarkers of neuropsychiatric disorders. Methodologically, the proposed work leverages upon the strengths of sparse and non-negative decompositions of imaging data, which offer several advantages over conventional mass-univariate and linear multivariate methods. One of the largest and most comprehensive cohorts of 1,600 individuals ages 8 through 21 provides unique imaging and clinical data to support the application of these methods to brain development.",Pattern Analysis of fMRI via machine learning/sparse models: application to brain development,9486921,R01EB022573,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Dictionary ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' indexing ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Philadelphia ', ' Psychotic Disorders ', ' psychotic illness ', ' Psychoses ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' cognitive function ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' human data ', ' cohort ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' novel ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Subgroup ', ' Clinical Data ', ' physiological imaging ', ' Physiologic Imaging ', ' Functional Imaging ', ' Pattern Recognition ', ' Pathologic ', ' trend ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' signal processing ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' early detection markers ', ' early biomarkers ', ' early detection biomarkers ', ' clinically useful biomarkers ', ' clinical biomarkers ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' connectome ', ' brain abnormalities ', ' personalized predictors ', ' individualized predictions ', ' Individualized Predictors ', ' personalized predictions ', ' ']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2018,549838,PA-03,0.029993073657769986
"Novel Accelerometer Calibration and Validation in Children andAdolescents Summary Accelerometers have been embraced by the scientific community as valid and reliable physical activity (PA) assessment tools. This is especially true in some sub-populations, such as children, who lack the ability to self- report their behaviors. Tremendous progress has been made in the objective assessment of PA and sedentary behavior (SB). Several measurement challenges remain that limit our ability to identify; dose-response associations with disease and risk factors, prevalence and determinants of these important health behaviors, changes in behavior due to time and intervention efforts. To overcome these challenges, we propose novel calibration procedures that will leverage the richness of three axes of raw acceleration data during free-living calibration activities, from wrist- and hip-worn accelerometers. Consistent with current PA recommendations for youth, the proposed study will focus on calibrating and validating accelerometer output to quantify intensity and duration of PA and identifying specific predominant modes of activity (e.g., sedentary time, locomotion, and fine/gross motor activity). Our primary goal is to follow best-practices data collection and analysis procedures to develop a comprehensive set of accelerometer algorithms that will accurately and precisely estimate minutes of various intensities of PA and mode of activity from hip- and wrist-worn accelerometers in children and adolescents (18 months to 21 years old), using video recorded direct observation during free-living activities as the criterion measure. Narrative Accurate and precise estimates of physical activity, sedentary behavior, and patterns of those behaviors in youth are essential in order to identify changes in those behaviors and to inform related policy decisions. The proposed research will extend previous accelerometer calibration studies by videotaping free-living activities in a large sample across a wide age range of children and adolescents. The raw acceleration signals from both hip- and wrist-worn devices will be analyzed using linear regression and machine learning methods to generate a family of freely available algorithms that produce accurate and precise estimates, reducing inconsistencies and confusion on use of previous accelerometer cutpoints in youth.",Novel Accelerometer Calibration and Validation in Children andAdolescents,9470866,R01DK110148,"['Acceleration ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Behavior ', ' Calibration ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communities ', ' Confusion ', ' Mental Confusion ', ' Confusional State ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Collection ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Controlled Environment ', ' artificial environment ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Hip region structure ', ' Hip ', ' Coxa ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Linear Regressions ', ' Locomotion ', ' Methods ', ' Motor Activity ', ' Locomotor Activity ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Time ', ' Videotape ', ' Work ', ' Wrist ', ' Measures ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' sedentary ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Physical assessment ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Frequencies ', ' Pattern ', ' behavior change ', ' age group ', ' novel ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' Devices ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' computerized data processing ', ' data processing ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Output ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' twenty-one years of age ', ' twenty-one year old ', ' age 21 years ', ' age 21 ', ' 21 years of age ', ' 21 year old ', ' Health behavior change ', ' Sedentary life-style ', ' Sedentary behavior ', ' sedentary lifestyle ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' Assessment tool ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' activity tracker ', ' activity monitor ', ' accelerometry ', ' Accelerometer ', ' Long-term cohort study ', ' Longitudinal cohort study ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST,R01,2018,345436,MA-02,0.03924871945760064
"ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project Abstract Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period associated with dramatic increases in rates of substance use. Identifying the pathways to substance use and its effects on child and adolescent development is critically important, as the effects of substance use during ongoing maturation likely have long-lasting effects on brain functioning and behavioral, health, and psychological outcomes. This Research Project Site application from the University of California, San Diego and Laureate Institute for Brain Research is in response to RFA-DA-15-015 as part of the ABCD-USA Consortium (5/13), to prospectively determine the neurodevelopmental and behavioral predictors and consequences of substance use on children and adolescents. A representative community sample of 1086 9-10 year olds enriched for high- risk characteristics will be recruited, contributing to the sample of 11,111 to be collected from 11 hubs across the ABCD- USA Consortium. All participants will undergo a comprehensive baseline assessment, including state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, bioassays, mobile monitoring and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning every 2 years. Interim annual interviews and quarterly web-based assessments will provide refined temporal resolution of behaviors, development, and life events with minimal participant burden. These Consortium-wide data obtained during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects of substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the “gateway interactions” between use of different substances. This hub’s Research Project focuses on mechanisms of substance use disorder, special populations with high use prevalence, and the use of drugs other than marijuana. (1) We will determine whether individual differences in neural processing of antireward (i.e., negative reinforcement mechanisms) in amygdala, insula, and anterior cingulate are associated with increased negative emotionality and pain, predict initiation of use and problem use, and are in turn further dysregulated by substance use. (2) We will determine whether protective environment factors and ethnic identification in minority youth are linked to healthier antireward processing and better substance use outcomes. (3) We will determine whether antireward neural processing predicts increased use of illicit drugs other than MJ including misuse of prescription drugs, if such use predicts subsequent exaggerated antireward processing, and if gateway interactions exist between substances. Finally, we will use machine learning approaches to develop a youth-specific risk calculator that will enable us to identify individually- based modifiable risk factors, providing brain-based targets of future novel prevention and intervention approaches.

"Externalizing outcomes in high risk youth Project Summary/abstract Public attention has often been drawn to the relationship between violence and mental health issues, but violent behavior is a very complex phenomenon undergirded by myriad social, psychological, environmental, and biological influences. This project intends to investigate these influences among a large sample of previously incarcerated youth, following up with them and collecting valuable longitudinal data. Our team worked with these youth and their families collecting detailed psychological, behavioral, and neuroimaging measures as part of a previous NIH-funded investigation. The current project aims to re-assess these individuals (now young adults) to examine long-range positive (i.e., desistance from drug use/antisocial behavior) and negative (relapse to drugs, antisocial behavior) outcomes. We will collect new neuroimaging scans, which combined with prior MRI data, will be useful for quantifying trajectories of change that map to persistence and desistence from externalizing outcomes. Advanced machine-learning approaches will be utilized in conjunction with structural, functional, network, and dynamic network brain measures in addition to behavioral and psychological measures. Machine learning approaches are capable of identifying patterns in high-dimensional data and delineating the unique combinations of variables that are most predictive of specific outcome variables. Using these methods, we intend to define neural mechanisms that predict outcomes. We also aim to identify combinations of variables that confer greater risk for persistent antisocial behavior and violence. The translational value of this work will be to clarify informative patterns of data that may indicate preventable outcomes. Furthermore, neural measures indicative of specific vulnerability will be identified as specific targets for treatment and novel intervention strategies. By identifying specific vulnerabilities and the changes that accompany positive outcomes, we will be closer to understanding the best way to recognize and prevent costly violent behavior. Project Narrative Recent attention has been drawn to the relationship between mental health issues and potentially preventable forms of violence, antisocial behavior, and substance abuse. This project aims to investigate neural, psychological, and life-course variables that may help predict divergent trajectories for persistent antisocial behavior and desistance by applying advanced statistical models in conjunction with longitudinal data from a unique sample of antisocial youth. Identifying variables that predict these outcomes will further help us to develop more efficacious treatment and intervention strategies.",Externalizing outcomes in high risk youth,9539584,R01HD092331,"['Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Aggressive behavior ', ' Aggression ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Crime ', ' Criminology ', ' Dangerousness ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Expenditure ', ' Family ', ' Firearms ', ' Follow-Up Studies ', ' Followup Studies ', ' Forensic Medicine ', ' Forensics ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' indexing ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Maps ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Neuropsychological Tests ', ' Neuropsychologic Tests ', ' New Mexico ', ' Psychological Factors ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Sociology ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' brain visualization ', ' Brain imaging ', ' Lateral ', ' Anterior ', ' Medial ', ' Area ', ' incarceration ', ' incarcerated ', ' Imprisonment ', ' Biological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Age of Onset ', ' Evaluation ', ' Discipline ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Scanning ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' psychosocial ', ' cohort ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Neural Development ', ' Structure ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' developmental psychology ', ' repeat offender ', ' multiple offender ', ' habitual offender ', ' social ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' anti social ', ' antisocial ', ' neural circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' MRI Scans ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' correctional system ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Academia ', ' Consent ', ' Data ', ' Sum ', ' Collection ', ' Security ', ' Pathologic ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' callous unemotional trait ', ' childhood trauma ', ' adolescent trauma ', ' pediatric trauma ', ' cost ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' convict ', ' externalizing behavior ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' neural mechanism ', ' neuromechanism ', ' cognitive neuroscience ', ' Impairment ', ' cognitive control ', ' high risk ', ' multimodality ', ' treatment strategy ', ' behavior outcome ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' anti-social behavior ', ' antisocial behavior ', ' trait impulsivity ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' outcome prediction ', ' high dimensionality ', ' protective factors ', ' ']",NICHD,THE MIND RESEARCH NETWORK,R01,2018,708752,NM-01,0.005551441713504218
"ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period associated with dramatic increases in rates of substance use. Identifying the pathways to substance use and its effects on child and adolescent development is critically important, as the effects of substance use during ongoing maturation likely have long-lasting effects on brain functioning and behavioral, health, and psychological outcomes. This Research Project Site application from the University of California, San Diego and Laureate Institute for Brain Research is in response to RFA-DA-15-015 as part of the ABCD-USA Consortium (5/13), to prospectively determine the neurodevelopmental and behavioral predictors and consequences of substance use on children and adolescents. A representative community sample of 1086 9-10 year olds enriched for high- risk characteristics will be recruited, contributing to the sample of 11,111 to be collected from 11 hubs across the ABCD- USA Consortium. All participants will undergo a comprehensive baseline assessment, including state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, bioassays, mobile monitoring and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning every 2 years. Interim annual interviews and quarterly web-based assessments will provide refined temporal resolution of behaviors, development, and life events with minimal participant burden. These Consortium-wide data obtained during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects of substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the ""gateway interactions"" between use of different substances. This hub's Research Project focuses on mechanisms of substance use disorder, special populations with high use prevalence, and the use of drugs other than marijuana. (1) We will determine whether individual differences in neural processing of antireward (i.e., negative reinforcement mechanisms) in amygdala, insula, and anterior cingulate are associated with increased negative emotionality and pain, predict initiation of use and problem use, and are in turn further dysregulated by substance use. (2) We will determine whether protective environment factors and ethnic identification in minority youth are linked to healthier antireward processing and better substance use outcomes. (3) We will determine whether antireward neural processing predicts increased use of illicit drugs other than MJ including misuse of prescription drugs, if such use predicts subsequent exaggerated antireward processing, and if gateway interactions exist between substances. Finally, we will use machine learning approaches to develop a youth-specific risk calculator that will enable us to identify individually- based modifiable risk factor, providing brain-based targets of future novel prevention and intervention approaches. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ABCD-USA Consortium will use multimodal brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, mobile monitoring, and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning in 11,111 adolescents followed over 10 years to determine the effects of substance use on adolescent brain and cognitive development. Our 5/13 ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project will recruit and assess 1086 youth age 9-10 at project entry. In addition to contributions to the overall consortium, our U01 will specifically focus on negative reinforcement mechanisms of substance use disorder, special populations with high SUD prevalence, and illicit drug and prescription medication misuse among adolescents.",ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project,9509385,U01DA041089,"['Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', '

"Technology-Enhanced Family-Focused Treatment for Adolescents at High Risk for Mood Disorders PROJECT SUMMARY  This proposal responds to RFA-MH-17-612, “Pilot Effectiveness Trials for Treatment, Preventive and Services Interventions (R34).” We have shown in several randomized trials that family-focused therapy (FFT) for symptomatic youth at high-risk for bipolar disorder - consisting of psychoeducation and family communication and problem solving skills training - is an effective adjunct to pharmacotherapy in hastening symptomatic recovery. However, between 50%-60% of high-risk youth still have residual mood symptoms and functional impairment after 18 weeks of FFT. In our prior studies, two constructs have emerged as predictors of lack of response to treatment: mood instability in the child and expressed emotion (EE) in parents (i.e., frequent critical comments or hostility). In adolescents (ages 12-18) with a parent with bipolar disorder or major depressive disorder, we hypothesize that augmenting FFT with frequent and targeted interventions in the home setting through a Smartphone app (MyCoachConnect, or MCC) will (a) have a greater and more rapid impact than standard FFT on the targeted mechanisms of mood instability in adolescents and EE in parents, and (b) as a result, enhance symptom resolution and functioning in adolescents. To be eligible, adolescents must score high on parent-rated measures of mood instability, and have at least one parent who is high-EE by speech sample coding criteria. The MCC app will record weekly open speech samples from parents and children and daily and weekly mood ratings from adolescents. The app assessments will be fed back to the FFT clinician, who will use this information to “push” recommendations for mood regulation, communication, and problem-solving strategies (linked to the FFT modules) for parents and youth. In year 1, we will conduct an open trial (n=25) to determine (a) the feasibility and acceptability of FFT with mobile coaching (FFT-MCC), as given by clinicians in community settings, and (b) associations between online/speech feature proxies of the targets (mood instability and EE as measured weekly by MCC) and standard measures of the targets. In years 2 and 3 we will conduct a 75- case RCT in which families are assigned to FFT with MCC skills coaching, FFT with MCC assessments only, with no coaching; or FFT Only, without MCC. We hypothesize that FFT-MCC will be acceptable to parents, adolescents and clinicians, and more effective than FFT without MCC coaching or FFT-Only in engaging the targets of mood instability and EE and promoting improvements in adolescents' mood symptoms and quality of life over 27 weeks. The study will facilitate the translation of a technological augmentation to an evidence-based family intervention, with the goal of increasing treatment access among families with mood disorders. Project Narrative/Relevance We propose to enhance the scalability of family-focused therapy (FFT), a 12-session evidence- based therapy for youth at high risk for mood disorders, through augmentation with a novel mobile phone application called MyCoachConnect (MCC). In adolescents with mood instability who have a parent with bipolar or major depressive disorder, clinicians in community clinics will conduct FFT sessions (consisting of psychoeducation and family skills training) supplemented by weekly MCC “real time” assessments of moods and family relationships; based on results of these assessments and the family's progress in treatment, clinicians will then push personalized informational and coaching alerts regarding the practice of communication and problem-solving skills. We hypothesize that the augmented version of FFT (FFT-MCC) will be more effective than FFT without coaching/informational alerts in altering treatment targets and in stabilizing youths' mood symptoms

"Mechanisms linking neighborhood poverty to problematic adolescent drug use PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Where a child grows up can inﬂuence his or her risk of problematic drug use. Surprisingly, policies and programs designed to improve neighborhood conditions have yielded conﬂicting results in which some children beneﬁt but others are harmed. Understanding the mechanisms by which neighborhoods act to affect problem- atic drug use and how these mechanisms differ across subgroups and cities—that is, understanding where and for whom mechanisms apply—is essential to optimize the effectiveness of future neighborhood interventions. Mechanisms involving mediation by aspects of the school environment have been unexamined, but could prove promising for understanding differential effects of neighborhood on problematic drug use. The objective of this K99/R00 is to identify school-based mechanisms that mediate the relationship between neighborhood poverty and problematic drug use and to develop statistical methods to understand how mediation effects differ across subgroup and place. This objective contributes to the long-term goal of improving the effectiveness of interven- tions to prevent drug abuse and dependence by tailoring interventions to address the most relevant mechanisms of action for each target population based on place and individual-level characteristics. The K99 phase ﬁlls the following training gaps that are critical to achieving the research objective and long-term goal: 1) methodologic training in causal mediation analysis; 2) subject-matter training in drug abuse and dependence prevention in ur- ban populations; and 3) involvement in real-world school-based interventions to develop methods with practical utility. Aim 1 of the proposed research identiﬁes the school environment mechanisms that mediate the relationship between neighborhood poverty and adolescent problematic drug use and modiﬁers of those mechanisms. Aim 2 extends a statistical method recently developed by the proposed research team for generalizing intervention ef- fects from one city to another to generalizing mediation effects. Finally, Aim 3 uses the method developed in Aim 2 to identify how the school environment mechanisms mediating neighborhood poverty and problematic drug use differ across major U.S. cities. The proposed research is expected to identify school-based mechanisms underly- ing differential effects of neighborhood poverty on adolescent problematic drug use by subgroup and place using the only study of randomized neighborhood residence. In addition, it is expected to contribute a novel statistical method that incorporates cutting-edge machine learning techniques to identify which mediation mechanisms can generalize across place, advancing translational research. Successful interventions are assumed to work in differ- ent settings, but that is not the case in practice. The proposed research will allow us to predict intervention effects while accounting for differences in population composition and modiﬁers of the mediation mechanism. This will make a signiﬁcant contribution to improving health by informing the design and targeting of future neighborhood interventions to adolescents and places that may be most impacted in terms of problematic drug use prevention. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed research is to expected to advance understanding of how two important contexts—neighborhood and school—act together to inﬂuence problematic drug use among adolescents, including how these mechanisms differ across adolescent subgroups and places. In addition, the proposed research will result in the development of a ﬂexible statistical method to predict intervention mechanism effects in new target populations, taking into account population composition. Together, these contributions are anticipated to optimize targeting of future interventions to prevent drug abuse and addiction.",Mechanisms linking neighborhood poverty to problematic adolescent drug use,9589463,R00DA042127,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Cities ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Drug abuse ', ' abuses drugs ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' Drug Use Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Poverty ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Safety ', ' Schools ', ' Students ', ' Target Populations ', ' Testing ', ' Tweens ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Mediating ', ' base ', ' career ', ' method development ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' residential site ', ' residence ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' bullying ', ' bully ', ' Hour ', ' Techniques ', ' novel ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Partner in relationship ', ' mate ', ' Prevention ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' boys ', ' girls ', ' Property ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' drug abuse prevention ', ' prevent drug use ', ' prevent drug addiction ', ' prevent drug abuse ', ' drug use prevention ', ' drug addiction prevention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Drug Addiction ', ' Drug Dependency ', ' Drug Dependence ', ' Chemical Dependence ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Subgroup ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' home visit ', ' House Call ', ' Home visitation ', ' youth drug use ', ' adolescent drug use ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' population based ', ' successful intervention ', ' intervention effect ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' societal costs ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R00,2018,247384,CA-03,0.054812202795528134
"Novel Approaches for Predicting Unstructured Short Periods of Physical Activities in Youth ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The use of accelerometers for the measurement of physical activity in youth has increased substantially over the last decade. Accelerometers are typically worn on the waist, however recently alternative placement sites such as the wrist have become more popular. For example, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is currently using the wrist location for their accelerometer physical activity measurements. Currently there is a lack of information about best approaches for analyzing accelerometer data from the wrist location with the ActiGraph accelerometer. In addition, advances in accelerometer technology allow for utilization of the raw acceleration signal with machine learning algorithms, which have the capability to predict activities and improve the estimates of energy expenditure over previously used methods. Members of this research group have shown improved activity classification and energy expenditure prediction in youth using Bipart, versus commonly used approaches such as Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machine. However, this preliminary work was based on accelerometer count data and structured lab activities with only a hip worn accelerometer. In addition, there are limitations to applying lab based models to true free-living activity. For example, free-living activity is not performed in structured bouts rather it is performed in micro-bouts over the course of the day which is problematic for methods designed to look at a string of data over a specified time period. There is minimal work currently on how to first segment bouts of free-living activity before classifying activity type and predicting energy expenditure. This proposal will extend our previous work using more advanced methods to analyze raw acceleration data (80 Hz) using a single wrist or hip worn accelerometer. One hundred youth will be measured during a semi-structured simulated free-living period (development group) and 200 youth will be measured during true free-living activity during an after-school program and at home (validation group). Measurements will include indirect calorimetry for energy expenditure and direct observation for activity type. The specific aims of the study are to: 1) develop and validate machine learning algorithms to segment bouts of activity during free-living activity in youth using: A) a hip worn accelerometer or B) a wrist worn accelerometer, and 2) develop and validate machine learning algorithms to classify physical activity type and estimate energy expenditure in youth, during free-living activity using: A) a hip worn accelerometer or B) a wrist worn accelerometer. Results from these studies will have direct and immediate impact for physical activity researchers utilizing accelerometers as well as analysis of NHANES wrist accelerometer data by providing ac- curate and precise methods for bout segmentation, prediction of activity type and energy expenditure.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop and validate machine learning algorithms using raw accelerometer data collected at the hip or wrist for use in youth. These algorithms will be able to detect the start and end times of free-living physical activity bouts, classify the type of activity being performed, and estimate energy expenditure, significantly improving upon current methods. These algorithms will have direct benefit to those examining dose response relationships between sedentary behaviors, physical activity and health outcomes in youth, in the physical activity and public health fields.            ",Novel Approaches for Predicting Unstructured Short Periods of Physical Activities in Youth,9688867,R01HD083431,"['Acceleration ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Algorithms ', ' Behavior ', ' Indirect Calorimetry ', ' Respiration Calorimetry ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Data Sources ', ' Energy Expenditure ', ' Energy Metabolism ', ' Environment ', ' Hip ', ' Coxa ', ' Hip region structure ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Methods ', ' body movement ', ' Movement ', ' Noise ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Sleep ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Wrist ', ' Measures ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ', ' NHANES ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Location ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Prevention ', ' after-school program ', ' afterschool program ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' model development ', ' actigraph ', ' actigraphy ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Collection ', ' Validation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Source Code ', ' obesity treatment ', ' time use ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' 18 year old ', ' eighteen years of age ', ' eighteen year old ', ' age 18 years ', ' 18 years of age ', ' public health relevance ', ' data reduction ', ' sedentary lifestyle ', ' Sedentary life-style ', ' Sedentary behavior ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' Accelerometer ', ' activity tracker ', ' activity monitor ', ' accelerometry ', ' artificial neural network ', ' synthetic neural network ', ' computational neural network ', ' artificial neural net ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE KNOXVILLE,R01,2019,416786,TN-02,0.07051780226674631
"Temperamental emotionality in preschoolers and depression risk PROJECT SUMMARY Depressive disorders (DD) are one of the most prevalent forms of mental disorders, and are associated with significant mortality, morbidity, and economic costs. The incidence of DD begins to increase in early-mid adolescence and peaks in emerging adulthood. The Stony Brook Temperament Study is a longitudinal study that seeks to identify early behavioral and neural precursors and risk factors for DD and understand the neurobiological and psychosocial processes through which these early manifestations develop into clinically significant psychopathology. We initially assessed a large community sample of 3-year old children, and have followed them at 3-year intervals through age 15. This competing renewal application seeks to re-evaluate the sample at ages 18 and 21. Specifically, we propose to trace pathways from laboratory observations of temperamental low positive emotionality and high negative emotionality at age 3 to neural indices of emotional and social information processing and DD symptoms and onsets from middle childhood through emerging adulthood. In addition, we seek to understand how life stress over the lifespan and the developmental challenges of emerging adulthood contribute to risk for DD, and to examine the specificity of these risk pathways in comparison with anxiety and substance use disorders. Finally, we will use cutting-edge machine learning techniques to maximize prediction of DD and understand which domains and developmental periods contribute most to prediction. This information about risk pathways and processes should contribute to understanding when and how to intervene in order to prevent DD and limit their progression. PROJECT NARRATIVE Depressive disorders are highly prevalent and associated with significant impairment and mortality. Rates of depression begin to rise rapidly in early-mid adolescence and peak in early adulthood.

"Mechanisms of resilience to developmental stress in children and adolescents. PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT Children and adolescents often grow up in the face of substantial developmental stress (i.e. trauma). While for some, this shifts the developmental trajectory to that of mental and general health disorders, others are resilient. Most research on developmental psychopathology is focused on risk while little is known on the mechanisms that confer resilience. The current study aims to identify biological (genomic, immune), psychological and cognitive mechanisms that underpin resilience in youth as defined by having low mood- anxiety and suicidal outcomes in youth with substantial developmental stress exposure (i.e. trauma and family history of depression). Elucidating resilience mechanisms has huge clinical implications as it will improve stratification of risk to develop depression and/or suicidal behavior, and could identify biological, psychological and cognitive targets that can inform development of future preventive interventions aimed at promoting resilience, reducing the mental and general health adverse outcomes associated with childhood adversity. The study capitalizes on a large dataset of genotyped youths from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC), that have been comprehensively phenotyped for cognitive performance and psychopathology, and that reported substantial trauma exposure. The proposed research integrates genomic and cognitive data with clinical measures used to define resilience in cross sectional analysis of ~9500 PNC youths (Aim 1); incorporates longitudinal data of depression and suicide measures, pulled from electronic medical record in a subset of ~750 PNC youths (Aim 2); and relies on prospective data collection that includes immune profiling of selected PNC individuals to allow identification of immune signature of resilience (Aim 3). Integration of genomic with clinical, cognitive and immune data will allow predictive modeling, and Big Data driven analysis will allow identification of resilience mechanisms. The candidate is a Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist physician scientist who is committed to translational research in youth at risk for psychiatric conditions. His overarching career goal is to develop methods for early identification of subclinical phenotypes before the onset of major psychiatric disorders (i.e. depression and suicide attempts) and, through neuroscience informed interventions, divert the developmental trajectory from that of risk to that of resilience. The career development plan capitalizes on a multidisciplinary mentorship team. It involves one-on one mentoring with the primary “clinical research” mentor as well as the genomic, biostatistical, neurocognitive and immune system expert co- mentors, integrated with hands on research supervision in data collection and statistical analysis, and didactic coursework and workshops. The program is tailored to meet research and training aims. The project will be conducted in the fostering environment of the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and the University of Pennsylvania, that will provide the academic mentorship and the required resources to execute the research and training aims, allowing the candidate to launch an independent research career. PROJECT NARRATIVE Childhood adversities impose risk to general and mental health development, including youth depression and suicidal behavior, still most children are resilient. Through integration of genetic, clinical, cognitive and demographic data from research data and medical records, this study will identify mechanisms that underpin resilience in a generalizable large sample of community youth with substantial exposure to adversity. Understanding resilience mechanisms is a critical milestone on the mission to develop neuroscience informed preventive interventions aimed at promoting resilience and reducing the health burden of

"Technology-Enhanced Family-Focused Treatment for Adolescents at High Risk for Mood Disorders PROJECT SUMMARY  This proposal responds to RFA-MH-17-612, “Pilot Effectiveness Trials for Treatment, Preventive and Services Interventions (R34).” We have shown in several randomized trials that family-focused therapy (FFT) for symptomatic youth at high-risk for bipolar disorder - consisting of psychoeducation and family communication and problem solving skills training - is an effective adjunct to pharmacotherapy in hastening symptomatic recovery. However, between 50%-60% of high-risk youth still have residual mood symptoms and functional impairment after 18 weeks of FFT. In our prior studies, two constructs have emerged as predictors of lack of response to treatment: mood instability in the child and expressed emotion (EE) in parents (i.e., frequent critical comments or hostility). In adolescents (ages 12-18) with a parent with bipolar disorder or major depressive disorder, we hypothesize that augmenting FFT with frequent and targeted interventions in the home setting through a Smartphone app (MyCoachConnect, or MCC) will (a) have a greater and more rapid impact than standard FFT on the targeted mechanisms of mood instability in adolescents and EE in parents, and (b) as a result, enhance symptom resolution and functioning in adolescents. To be eligible, adolescents must score high on parent-rated measures of mood instability, and have at least one parent who is high-EE by speech sample coding criteria. The MCC app will record weekly open speech samples from parents and children and daily and weekly mood ratings from adolescents. The app assessments will be fed back to the FFT clinician, who will use this information to “push” recommendations for mood regulation, communication, and problem-solving strategies (linked to the FFT modules) for parents and youth. In year 1, we will conduct an open trial (n=25) to determine (a) the feasibility and acceptability of FFT with mobile coaching (FFT-MCC), as given by clinicians in community settings, and (b) associations between online/speech feature proxies of the targets (mood instability and EE as measured weekly by MCC) and standard measures of the targets. In years 2 and 3 we will conduct a 75- case RCT in which families are assigned to FFT with MCC skills coaching, FFT with MCC assessments only, with no coaching; or FFT Only, without MCC. We hypothesize that FFT-MCC will be acceptable to parents, adolescents and clinicians, and more effective than FFT without MCC coaching or FFT-Only in engaging the targets of mood instability and EE and promoting improvements in adolescents' mood symptoms and quality of life over 27 weeks. The study will facilitate the translation of a technological augmentation to an evidence-based family intervention, with the goal of increasing treatment access among families with mood disorders. Project Narrative/Relevance We propose to enhance the scalability of family-focused therapy (FFT), a 12-session evidence- based therapy for youth at high risk for mood disorders, through augmentation with a novel mobile phone application called MyCoachConnect (MCC). In adolescents with mood instability who have a parent with bipolar or major depressive disorder, clinicians in community clinics will conduct FFT sessions (consisting of psychoeducation and family skills training) supplemented by weekly MCC “real time” assessments of moods and family relationships; based on results of these assessments and the family's progress in treatment, clinicians will then push personalized informational and coaching alerts regarding the practice of communication and problem-solving skills. We hypothesize that the augmented version of FFT (FFT-MCC) will be more effective than FFT without coaching/informational alerts in altering treatment targets and in stabilizing youths' mood symptoms

"Adolescent Brain Bases of Intergenerational Risk for Depression Project Summary Adolescence is a critical time for understanding Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) because nearly half of lifetime diagnoses of psychiatric disorders begin by age 14. Further, intergenerational risk for depression (RISK; having a parent with MDD) increases adolescent likelihood of developing MDD by three- to five-fold. The goal of this research is to understand adolescent neural factors associated with RISK and to characterize the neurodevelopmental path of RISK adolescents. The proposed research adds to an ongoing NIMH grant (U01MH108168) that compares brain function and structure between adolescents (ages 14-15) with MDD and adolescents without MDD/intergenerational risk for MDD (CON). I propose to add a new group of adolescents who are at intergenerational risk for depression (RISK) to address the following aims. First, I aim to dissociate functional and structural neural differences between risk (traits) and clinical diagnosis (state) of adolescent MDD. I will recruit and characterize 120 age- and sex-matched adolescents (ages 14-15): 40 adolescents at RISK for depression but without a personal history of MDD (RISK), 40 adolescents without RISK and no history of MDD (CON), and 40 adolescents with current MDD. I will perform (a) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), (b) structural MRI (sMRI), and (c) diffusion MRI (dMRI). Second, I aim to discover neurodevelopmental differences associated with RISK. I will re-characterize and re-scan RISK and CON adolescents two years after initial scanning. I will assess differences in functional and structural neurodevelopment between RISK and CON adolescents over this two-year period. I will also assess the extent to which RISK-associated neurodevelopmental changes in brain function and structure are related to development of depressive symptoms. Third, I aim to discover whether multimodal baseline measures predict progression of depressive symptoms in RISK adolescents. All 120 adolescents will undergo extensive clinical and neural characterization at study enrollment, and will undergo follow-up clinical examinations every six months for two years post- enrollment. I will determine whether behavioral and/or brain measures at enrollment predict the subsequent progression of depressive symptoms over this two-year period. The proposed research would be the first to: 1) dissociate functional and structural brain differences between RISK, MDD, and CON adolescents, 2) determine neurodevelopmental changes in RISK compared to CON adolescents, and 3) provide precise biological prediction of the development of depressive symptomology in at-risk adolescents. Knowledge gained from this study will provide a new understanding of the neural underpinning of both risk and developed depression in adolescence, as well as provide valuable contribution toward early prevention of MDD. Project Narrative Children of depressed parents are at increased risk for substance abuse, psychiatric disorders, and decreased social and scholastic functioning. The goal of this research is to understand adolescent neural factors associated with familial risk for depression and to characterize the neurodevelopmental path of these adolescents. We will use advanced behavioral and neuroimaging techniques to understand how developmental changes in the brain are implicated in developmental changes in depressive symptoms in adolescents at familial risk for depression.",Adolescent Brain Bases of Intergenerational Risk for Depression,9780580,F32MH114525,"['Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdala ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' face expression ', ' Facial Expression ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Moods ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' Parents ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Measures ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' career ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Training ', ' Early Intervention ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' Depressed mood ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Psychiatric Diagnosis ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scanning ', ' Techniques ', ' Dyslexia ', ' Word Blindness ', ' intergenerational ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Neural Development ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' white matter ', ' substantia alba ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Deterioration ', ' Modeling ', ' brain volume ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' dMRI ', ' Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Diffusion weighted imaging ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' DWI-MRI ', ' DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) ', ' major depression disorder ', ' major depression ', ' clinical depression ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' Address ', ' Base of the Brain ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Validation ', ' sex ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Feeling ', ' feelings ', ' Behavioral ', ' Behavioral Assay ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' child depression ', ' youth depression ', ' pediatric depression ', ' depression in adolescence ', ' depressed adolescents ', ' childhood onset depression ', ' childhood depression ', ' adolescents with depression ', ' adolescent depression ', ' Affective ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' Social Anxiety Disorder ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,F32,2019,7702,MA-07,0.10494037892471265
"Pattern Analysis of fMRI via machine learning/sparse models: application to brain development Abstract Resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) provides reproducible, task-independent biomarkers of coherent functional activity linking different brain regions. The main goal of the proposed project is to leverage advances in signal processing and machine learning methods to derive clinically useful biomarkers based on patterns of functional connectivity, and to test these biomarkers in a large study of brain development. Central to our methodology are 1) computing a subject-specific functional parcellation of the brain, which defines nodes for characterizing individualized functional brain networks; 2) extracting sparse connectivity patterns for robustly representing brain networks; 3) capturing heterogeneity in brain networks across individuals in a given population; and 4) deriving individualized predictive indices of psychosis risk from brain connectivity in a large study of brain development. This novel suite of functional connectivity analysis tools will be developed and validated based on data from the Human Connectome Project and the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC). Finally, these techniques will be applied to PNC data in order to delineate heterogeneity in network development in youth with psychosis-spectrum symptoms. Our hypothesis is that patterns of functional connectivity in adolescents with psychosis-spectrum symptoms will be different from those in typically developing adolescents, and this difference will display a high degree of heterogeneity that is linked to underlying heterogeneity in pathologic neurodevelopmental trajectories. Moreover, we expect that machine learning techniques will allow us to predict on an individual basis which adolescents with psychosis-spectrum symptoms will remain stable, which will revert to normal, and which will progress to psychosis, based on their baseline functional connectivity signatures. Our methods are generally applicable to rsfMRI studies for detecting and quantifying spatio-temporal functional connectivity patterns in diverse fields, including diagnosing brain abnormalities in neuropsychiatric diseases, and finding associations of functional connectivity with different cognitive functions. All methods will be made publicly available and form an important new resource for the broader neuroscience community. Project narrative This proposal develops a suite of advanced functional imaging pattern analysis methods, aiming to delineate heterogeneity in brain network development in youth with psychosis-spectrum symptoms, ultimately leading to early biomarkers of neuropsychiatric disorders. Methodologically, the proposed work leverages upon the strengths of sparse and non-negative decompositions of imaging data, which offer several advantages over conventional mass-univariate and linear multivariate methods. One of the largest and most comprehensive cohorts of 1,600 individuals ages 8 through 21 provides unique imaging and clinical data to support the application of these methods to brain development.",Pattern Analysis of fMRI via machine learning/sparse models: application to brain development,9695211,R01EB022573,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Dictionary ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' indexing ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Philadelphia ', ' psychotic illness ', ' Psychoses ', ' Psychotic Disorders ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' cognitive function ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' human data ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' novel ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Subgroup ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Functional Imaging ', ' physiological imaging ', ' Physiologic Imaging ', ' Pattern Recognition ', ' Pathologic ', ' trend ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' signal processing ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' early detection biomarkers ', ' early detection markers ', ' early biomarkers ', ' clinical biomarkers ', ' clinically useful biomarkers ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' connectome ', ' brain abnormalities ', ' personalized predictions ', ' personalized predictors ', ' individualized predictions ', ' Individualized Predictors ', ' ']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,522460,PA-03,0.029993073657769986
"Novel Accelerometer Calibration and Validation in Children andAdolescents Summary Accelerometers have been embraced by the scientific community as valid and reliable physical activity (PA) assessment tools. This is especially true in some sub-populations, such as children, who lack the ability to self- report their behaviors. Tremendous progress has been made in the objective assessment of PA and sedentary behavior (SB). Several measurement challenges remain that limit our ability to identify; dose-response associations with disease and risk factors, prevalence and determinants of these important health behaviors, changes in behavior due to time and intervention efforts. To overcome these challenges, we propose novel calibration procedures that will leverage the richness of three axes of raw acceleration data during free-living calibration activities, from wrist- and hip-worn accelerometers. Consistent with current PA recommendations for youth, the proposed study will focus on calibrating and validating accelerometer output to quantify intensity and duration of PA and identifying specific predominant modes of activity (e.g., sedentary time, locomotion, and fine/gross motor activity). Our primary goal is to follow best-practices data collection and analysis procedures to develop a comprehensive set of accelerometer algorithms that will accurately and precisely estimate minutes of various intensities of PA and mode of activity from hip- and wrist-worn accelerometers in children and adolescents (18 months to 21 years old), using video recorded direct observation during free-living activities as the criterion measure. Narrative Accurate and precise estimates of physical activity, sedentary behavior, and patterns of those behaviors in youth are essential in order to identify changes in those behaviors and to inform related policy decisions. The proposed research will extend previous accelerometer calibration studies by videotaping free-living activities in a large sample across a wide age range of children and adolescents. The raw acceleration signals from both hip- and wrist-worn devices will be analyzed using linear regression and machine learning methods to generate a family of freely available algorithms that produce accurate and precise estimates, reducing inconsistencies and confusion on use of previous accelerometer cutpoints in youth.",Novel Accelerometer Calibration and Validation in Children andAdolescents,9701986,R01DK110148,"['Acceleration ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Behavior ', ' Calibration ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Communities ', ' Mental Confusion ', ' Confusional State ', ' Confusion ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Collection ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' artificial environment ', ' Controlled Environment ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Hip ', ' Coxa ', ' Hip region structure ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Linear Regressions ', ' Locomotion ', ' Methods ', ' Locomotor Activity ', ' Motor Activity ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Time ', ' Videotape ', ' Work ', ' Wrist ', ' Measures ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' sedentary ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Physical assessment ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Frequencies ', ' Pattern ', ' behavior change ', ' age group ', ' novel ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' Devices ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' actigraph ', ' actigraphy ', ' data processing ', ' computerized data processing ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Output ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' 21 year old ', ' twenty-one years of age ', ' twenty-one year old ', ' age 21 years ', ' age 21 ', ' 21 years of age ', ' Health behavior change ', ' sedentary lifestyle ', ' Sedentary life-style ', ' Sedentary behavior ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' Accelerometer ', ' activity tracker ', ' activity monitor ', ' accelerometry ', ' Longitudinal cohort study ', ' Longterm cohort study ', ' Long-term cohort study ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST,R01,2019,362004,MA-02,0.03924871945760064
"Neural Mechanisms of Irritability: A Dimensional Approach with Integration of Multi-Voxel Pattern Analysis and Univariate Analysis Chronic, clinically-impairing irritability is a serious health problem that affects 3-5% of youth and predicts both adult depressive and anxiety disorders and long-term impairment. Current studies on the neural mechanisms of irritability in youth employ traditional univariate analyses and have limitations: (1) they examine activation patterns in particular regions, thus using only a small portion of the data and (2) they tend to find small to moderate effect sizes. In addition, little is known about functional connectivity at rest and its association with irritability or the ability of neural measures to predict changes in irritability over time. These limitations could be addressed through research using multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA), i.e., by applying machine learning methods to both resting state and task-based fMRI data. MVPA exploits the full spatial pattern of brain activity and thus has increased sensitivity compared to conventional univariate, individual-voxel-based general linear model (GLM) approaches. However, univariate analyses may provide complementary or unique information relative to MVPA, given its sensitivity to variability and global engagement of task effects between subjects. The specific aims of this project are to identify patterns of whole-brain activation (Aim 1 & 2a, 2b) and functional connectivity at rest (Aim 2a, 2b) using a combination of MVPA and univariate approaches to predict (1) individual differences in irritability in a clinical sample of youth and in healthy youth with varying degrees of irritability, and (2a) individual differences in irritability and (2b) changes in irritability 6 months later in a community sample of youth with varying degrees of irritability. This work will provide new insights into the pathophysiology of multiple mental disorders for which irritability is an important symptom, and it has the potential to identify biomarkers that can be used to predict the course and prognosis of clinically-impairing irritability. The long-term goal of the PI is to become an independent NIH-funded investigator with a neuroscience-focused research program targeting developmental trajectories of irritability. To achieve this goal, the PI aims to expand her previous training to support both advanced, independent research on resting state and task-based fMRI and the use of pattern classification techniques, as well as their integration with univariate methods, applied in samples with varying degrees of irritability. This training objective directly supports the PI’s research objective, which is to identify the neural mechanisms of irritability and neural correlates that predict changes in irritability over time using a combination of MVPA and univariate imaging methods applied to task-based and resting state fMRI data. The central hypothesis, based on the PI’s pilot data, is that activity patterns during a frustration task, along with connectivity patterns at rest, will predict levels of, and changes in, irritability. Both univariate and MVPA approaches will converge on similar findings; however, MVPA will identify additional activation and connectivity patterns predictive of irritability or changes in irritability. The training objectives for this award are to enhance the PI’s research and professional skills and knowledge in three areas: (1) phenotyping clinically-impairing irritability; (2) task-based and resting state fMRI methods, designs, preprocessing, and advanced MVPA techniques, i.e., machine learning for analyzing fMRI data, and their integration with univariate analyses; and (3) professional skills essential for a successful research career as a faculty member at a research university. By completing the proposed research and training, the PI expects to obtain sufficient training to function as an independent developmental affective neuroscientist, and sufficient pilot data to submit a competitive R01 application designed to examine predictors of developmental changes in pediatric irritability across multiple levels of analysis from neural circuits, behaviors, social experiences, to environmental factors. The proposed project is relevant to public health because impairing irritability affects approximately 2.5 million youth in the U.S., and is a relatively common source of concern for clinicians, parents, and teachers. Clinicallyimpairing irritability in youth has been linked to adult psychopathology and is among the strongest predictors of suicidality across the life span. A better understanding of the neural markers underlying irritability and changes in irritability has significant potential to inform a better diagnostic classification system and to provide biomarkers for making treatment decisions, monitoring treatment responses, and predicting the developmental course of irritability.",Neural Mechanisms of Irritability: A Dimensional Approach with Integration of Multi-Voxel Pattern Analysis and Univariate Analysis,9986132,R00MH110570,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdala ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Attention ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Biological Sciences ', ' Life Sciences ', ' Bioscience ', ' Biologic Sciences ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Child Psychiatry ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Communities ', ' Depressive disorder ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Faculty ', ' Feedback ', ' Frustration ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Linear Models ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Methods ', ' body movement ', ' Movement ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Parents ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' Public Health ', ' Reproducibility of Findings ', ' Reproducibility of Results ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Rest ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Suicide ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Inferior frontal gyrus ', ' Inferior Frontal Convolution ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' teacher ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Sample Size ', ' Funding ', ' Functional disorder ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Parietal ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Categories ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' neural circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' imaging method ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Research Training ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' clinical phenotype ', ' time use ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Neuronal Dysfunction ', ' neural dysfunction ', ' Individual Differences ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' Impairment ', ' Affective ', ' treatment response ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' RDoC ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' neural correlate ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' Developmental Course ', ' personalized predictions ', ' personalized predictors ', ' individualized predictions ', ' Individualized Predictors ', ' ']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,R00,2019,249000,CT-03,0.05573226204276842
"Wiring Adolescents With Social Anxiety via Behavioral Interventions (WASABI): a closed-loop mobile intervention to reduce social anxiety and improve social skills PROJECT SUMMARY The goal of this project is to further develop (to pivotal trial readiness) and evaluate WASABI (Wiring Adolescents With Social Anxiety via Behavioral Interventions)–a clinician-assisted, adjunct to treatment, mobile application designed to augment the efficacy of psychological Evidence Based Treatments through a closed-loop technology. In this project, we will build upon promising results obtained from two studies in anxiety and psychosis, leverage pilot data collected in adolescents with Social Anxiety (SA), and test WASABI as an adjunct to digital Cognitive Behavioral Group Therapy (dCBGT). Via Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMAs) WASABI will capture data on social anxiety, its underlying cognitive biases, and on social role performance. These data will populate a predictive machine learning algorithm that will alert the WASABI clinician and end- user of whenever social anxiety reaches clinical significance. The clinician will use this information to initiate synchronous or asynchronous Instant Messaging (IM)-based conversations with the goal of supporting, recommending and reinforcing relevant skills to alleviate the momentary distress, to increase social competence, and/or to improve contextual social role performance. Similarly, the clinician will leverage WASABI data to personalize dCBGT content during the weekly group video-calls. This individualized assessment, monitoring, and treatment approach is posited to induce flexible adaptive long-term learning about social-emotional events, and support the generalization of trained cognitive skills within the everyday lives of adolescents, thus improving their clinical and functional status. In Specific Aim 1, we will first involve three adolescents with SA and two clinicians in three focus groups that will be organized to refine WASABI and qualitatively evaluate its manageability, clinical usefulness, and acceptability. Once decisions regarding the app and dashboard design are made, the three adolescents will be involved in a 2-week trial run, during which the predictive ability of the algorithm will be validated by the WASABI clinician, who will verify via 1:1 remote videocalls the actual presence of clinically-significant social anxiety whenever she receives an alert. Additionally, the test run will ensure that WASABI EMA data are timely evaluated by the clinician on the dashboard and meaningfully orient the delivery of individualized IM and weekly dCBGT content. At the end of this test run, each stakeholder will be asked to rate enjoyment, ease of use, product quality, and perceived usefulness. Finally, we will submit these data from the trial run to our consultant to confirm that WASABI is suitable for evaluation in the feasibility trial. In Specific Aim 2, to evaluate the acceptability and preliminary efficacy of WASABI, we will conduct a pilot augmentation trial with 32 adolescents with SA who will be randomized to dCBGT+WASABI vs dCBGT only. At the completion of this project we will have usability data sufficient to support a RCT in Phase II designed to establish medical claims defining the efficacy of this intervention. At the completion of Phase II, we will be able to complete the FDA regulatory pathway and have the opportunity to improve the lives of people suffering from this condition. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of the current project is to elaborate upon, reconstruct and advance to pivotal trial readiness WASABI (Wiring Adolescents With Social Anxiety via Behavioral Interventions)–a clinician-assisted, adjunct to treatment, mobile application designed to augment the efficacy of psychological evidence-based treatments. By processing Ecological Momentary Assessments data collected from mobile devices, the WASABI closed-loop algorithm detects exacerbation of social anxiety, and cues 1:1 and group-based Instant Messaging with peers and providers. In this Phase I trial, we will test WASABI as an adjunct to digital Cognitive Behavioral Group Therapy in adolescents with Social Anxiety, with the goal of promoting the generalization of trained cognitive skills in the natural environment, thus improving anxiety and social functioning.",Wiring Adolescents With Social Anxiety via Behavioral Interventions (WASABI): a closed-loop mobile intervention to reduce social anxiety and improve social skills,9847582,R43MH121209,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Aftercare ', ' post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anxiety ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Clinic Visits ', ' Communication ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Cues ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Environment ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' geographic site ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Goals ', ' interpersonal relationship ', ' Interpersonal Interaction ', ' Interpersonal Relations ', ' Learning ', ' Minnesota ', ' Patients ', ' psychotic illness ', ' Psychoses ', ' Psychotic Disorders ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Running ', ' Schools ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Standardization ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Target Populations ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' waitlist ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' Measures ', ' Competence ', ' Mediating ', ' Psychotic Mood Disorders ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Distress ', ' Recovery ', ' Program Sustainability ', ' Program Sustainabilities ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Notification ', ' Hour ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' functional status ', ' attenuation ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' social skills ', ' social competency ', ' social competence ', ' interpersonal competency ', ' interpersonal competence ', ' social ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Provider ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Regulatory Pathway ', ' Sum ', ' Cognitive ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Group Therapy ', ' Behavioral ', ' Evidence based treatment ', ' cognitive training ', ' feeding ', ' digital ', ' Social Functioning ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' efficacy trial ', ' cost effective ', ' Social skills development ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' mobile device ', ' usability ', ' week trial ', ' prototype ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' mobile application ', ' mobile app ', ' clinical predictors ', ' social situation ', ' social anxiety ', ' anxious ', ' cognitive skill ', ' phase I trial ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' dashboard ', ' recruit ', ' phase 2 designs ', ' phase II designs ', ' feasibility trial ', ' real time monitoring ', ' realtime monitoring ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' adherence rate ', ' learning algorithm ', ' ']",NIMH,POSIT SCIENCE CORPORATION,R43,2019,243975,CA-12,0.051781224832822645
"Course and Outcome of Bipolar Disorder in Youth ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Course and Outcome of Bipolar Disorders in Youth (COBY) study has comprehensively characterized the clinical course of a large sample of youth with bipolar disorder (BD), and has identified demographic and clinical factors that are associated with different illness courses. To date, however, COBY has not included neuroimaging assessments. Including such assessments now will allow, for the first time, an evaluation of the impact of 13-year course of BD and treatment upon neural circuitry function and structure. Furthermore, the majority of COBY participants are currently between 18-30 years old, when the brain, and prefrontal cortex in particular, continues to develop. Including neuroimaging assessments in COBY participants now can thus take advantage of the neurodevelopmental processes occurring between 18-30 years where there are unique opportunities to intervene therapeutically to help normalize abnormalities in neural functioning and structure. Focusing on this age range will also provide a critically important opportunity to determine the extent to which neuroimaging measures predict future clinical course in adulthood. Having normal prefrontal cortical function and structure may predict better clinical course in adulthood, even in COBY participants with poor clinical course in youth, and may lead to decisions to reduce, or even stop, specific treatments in these individuals. In the proposed study, we will determine how previous BD clinical course (e.g., % time with mood symptoms vs. euthymic; % time with comorbid disorders) and treatment exposure from childhood into adulthood impacts neural circuitry functioning and structure supporting key NIMH RDoC information processing domains, and compare neuroimaging findings in COBY participants with those of demographically-matched healthy controls (Aim 1). We will also determine whether neuroimaging measures predict illness course in adulthood, beyond demographic and clinical factors, and previous clinical course in youth (Aim 2). We will use machine learning to explore patterns of wholebrain functioning, white and gray matter structure, and clinical and demographic measures, that most accurately predict future clinical course at the individual subject level. The proposed study also provides a valuable opportunity to inform the field regarding the clinical and functional course and outcome from youth into adulthood in a large, well-characterized sample of people with BD. This is important because the clinical outcome of BD youth in adulthood remains uncertain, as only two studies with a total of 72 subjects followed BD youth into their early twenties. Structural and functional neuroimaging techniques will be employed in a representative subsample of COBY participants (n=120), and healthy controls (n=50). Comprehensive assessments of psychopathology and functioning will be collected at the time of neuroimaging, and twice more during the proposed project period in the 120 COBY participants. This proposal accords with the NIMH's mission to define developmental trajectories of mental disorders and develop strategies to better define risk and protective factors for disease trajectories across the lifespan, and with the RDoC initiative. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The aim of the proposed study is to identify the impact of long-term previous clinical course and treatment on the brain in individuals with childhood-onset bipolar disorder, and examine how these changes in the brain influence future clinical course during adulthood. The participants are currently between 18-30 years old when the brain begins to achieve full maturity. Thus, this study will provide a unique opportunity to determine the extent to which neuroimaging measures predict future clinical course during an important neurodevelopmental period in individuals with bipolar disorder and can yield findings that will aid treatment decisions for these individuals.",Course and Outcome of Bipolar Disorder in Youth,9644557,R01MH059929,"['Accounting ', ' Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdala ', ' Anxiety ', ' Arousal ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Future ', ' substantia grisea ', ' gray matter ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hippocampus ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Literature ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Mission ', ' Moods ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' Rest ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' Medial ', ' Clinical ', ' Fiber ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Individual ', ' Onset of illness ', ' disorder onset ', ' disease onset ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' psychosocial ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Structure ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' Participant ', ' white matter ', ' substantia alba ', ' Neurophysiology - biologic function ', ' neural function ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Ventral Striatum ', ' neural circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' Emotional ', ' Sampling ', ' Symptoms ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' positive emotional state ', ' positive emotion ', ' Outcome ', ' Impact evaluation ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' reward processing ', ' cognitive control ', ' critical period ', ' information processing ', ' public health relevance ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' neural patterning ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' RDoC ', ' Positive Valence ', ' Negative Valence ', ' symptomatology ', ' associated symptom ', ' symptom comorbidity ', ' symptom association ', ' cooccuring symptom ', ' concurrent symptom ', ' comorbid symptom ', ' mood symptom ', ' clinical imaging ', ' protective factors ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,638179,PA-18,0.06677565500068593
"Using Adolescent Nonverbal Behavior to Predict Aggression Against Bullies and Bystanders PROJECT SUMMARY Aggression linked to peer-based rejection and bullying is a leading cause of injury and psychological distress among middle school-aged adolescents, and occurs at higher rates in youth exposed to harsh parenting. Tradi- tional intervention programs that target those at risk for perpetrating aggression due to harsh parenting have had only limited success. This lack of success may be due to the fact that aggression is the product of complex decision-making processes that are influenced by current states of attention, arousal, and affect. A different approach is to prevent aggression before it happens by interceding when nonverbal indices signal a shift in these critical states. An essential first step towards establishing this prevention-based approach is to isolate nonverbal behavior that reliably predicts forthcoming aggression in high-risk adolescents. Eye gaze, pupillary dilation, and facial expressions are strong nonverbal behavioral candidates given that they are well-established indices of attention, arousal, and affective states. The current proposal uses computational modeling to test the predictive link between these nonverbal behaviors elicited during an ecologically valid social rejection paradigm and subsequent expression of peer-based aggression in adolescents (11-14 years; N=80) with high and low exposure to harsh parenting. Results will lay the groundwork for our long-term objective, to develop next gen- eration interventions aimed at preventing aggression the moment its behavioral precursors are detected. PROJECT NARRATIVE Aggression linked to peer-based rejection and bullying is a costly public health problem that is inadequately addressed by existing interventions. The goal of this project is to implement computational modeling to predict aggression in low and high-risk youth using nonverbal behavior elicited during social rejection and aggression- related decision-making.

"Impulsivity as Immaturity: Mapping Dysmaturation of the Brain's Control Architecture in Youth Externalizing Psychopathology ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Youth with externalizing psychopathologies, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and conduct disorder, present with diverse kinds of impulsivity symptoms, which in turn reflect deficits in regulatory control functioning. An emerging neurodevelopmental model, which we call the Impulsivity as Immaturity Model, could potentially transform our understanding of the brain basis of regulatory dysfunction. The brain's regulatory control architecture (RCA) undergoes massive maturation during childhood and adolescence. The Impulsivity as Immaturity Model proposes that aberrant maturation in distinct components of the RCA gives rise to distinct patterns of impulsivity symptoms-e.g., delayed maturation in certain attention control components gives rise to attentional variability, a specific form of attention dysfunction. Informed by this model, we will use a mixed cohort/longitudinal design enrolling 135 healthy youth and 135 youth with externalizing psychopathologies. Using advanced multivariate/multimodal analytic methods, we will map the normative neurodevelopmental trajectories of major components of the RCA including components involved in attention, motor, emotion, and appetitive control. We will then construct multivariate models that predict different forms of impulsivity based on neurodevelopment patterns of RCA components. Successful completion of this project will be a critical first step in development of a new class of imaging-based immaturity biomarkers that index distinct types of impulsivity irrespective of the specific externalizing disorders in which they manifest. This will lead to earlier, more reliable diagnosis of impulsivity problems in youth and spur the development of transdiagnostic, biologically based interventions that target specific forms of RCA dysmaturation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Using neuroimaging, we will map the development of key components of the brain's regulatory control architecture in a sample of youth with externalizing disorders and diverse kinds of impulsivity symptoms. We will use these maps to develop a new class of neuroimaging biomarkers for specific forms of impulsivity. This research will advance the development of biologically informed dimensional approaches for characterizing complex impulsivity phenotypes and will spur the development of new treatments.",Impulsivity as Immaturity: Mapping Dysmaturation of the Brain's Control Architecture in Youth Externalizing Psychopathology,9725782,R01MH107741,"['Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Desire for food ', ' Appetite ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Attention ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Emotions ', ' indexing ', ' Joints ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Michigan ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' neuropsychologic ', ' Neuropsychologies ', ' Neuropsychology ', ' Oppositional Defiant Disorder ', ' Phenotype ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Rewards ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' disorders of conduct ', ' disorder of conduct ', ' Conduct Disorder ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' Functional disorder ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Hyperactive behavior ', ' Motor Hyperactivity ', ' Hyperkinetic Movements ', ' Hyperkinesis ', ' Hyperkinesia ', ' Hyperactivity ', ' Investigation ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Pattern ', ' mind control ', ' brain control ', ' cohort ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Neural Development ', ' Structure ', ' Biologic Development ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' Participant ', ' research study ', ' Categories ', ' disease classification ', ' nosology ', ' disorder classification ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Hyperactivity Disorder NOS ', ' ADHD ', ' AD/HD ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' vector ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' Advanced Development ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' independent component analysis ', ' public health relevance ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' early adolescence ', ' longitudinal design ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' RDoC ', ' attentional control ', ' emotion dysregulation ', ' emotional dysregulation ', ' specific biomarkers ', ' connectome ', ' Longitudinal cohort ', ' Longterm cohort ', ' Long-term cohort ', ' neuroimaging marker ', ' neuroimaging biomarker ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2019,446742,MI-12,0.05788577218443883

"Neurobehavioral mechanisms of parent-child extinction learning in adolescent PTSD Project Summary The goal of this proposal is to elucidate neurobehavioral mechanisms of parent-child extinction learning in early adolescent PTSD. Notably, deficits in directly learned fear extinction are implicated in adult PTSD. However, youth with PTSD live within the family system, which could impact their ability to extinguish trauma memories. Indeed, abnormal parent-child transmission of fear following trauma is a potent risk factor for youth PTSD. Furthermore, trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT), the gold-standard treatment for pediatric PTSD, uses exposure therapy of the child's trauma narrative for both youth and their caregiver. Here, TF-CBT aims to promote extinction of trauma-related fear both directly in the child and vicariously through parent modeling. However, no reported studies have examined the cumulative impact of direct and vicarious fear extinction in pediatric PTSD. Finally, the diagnosis of PTSD in youth continues to rely on DSM syndromal criteria, creating a great need to establish objective, biologically based diagnoses. This innovative research program will (1) identify physiological impairments in direct/vicarious fear extinction and their unique contributions to adolescent PTSD, (2) identify the neural substrates of fear acquisition and direct/vicarious extinction learning in adolescent PTSD, and (3) use machine learning on biomarkers of fear acquisition and direct/vicarious extinction to classify trauma exposure and PTSD diagnosis in adolescents. This interdisciplinary research team will recruit 40 non-traumatized typically developing (TD) youth, 40 trauma- exposed comparison (TEC) youth without mental illness, and 80 medication-free youth with PTSD, ages 10-14, along with their primary caregiving parent. Youth and parents will undergo fear acquisition followed by a novel fear extinction paradigm. Here, youth will undergo two extinction training conditions: 1) direct extinction and 2) vicarious extinction by observing their parent complete extinction training. Parent/child skin conductance and corrugator EMG will be measured during all fear protocol phases. Additionally, youth will complete all fear phases during fMRI to probe neural substrates of fear acquisition, and direct and vicarious extinction. Following physiological and fMRI analyses, a deep evolutionary machine learning approach will be applied to youth neurophysiological fear indices to classify trauma and PTSD status. Primary analyses will 1) examine physiological markers of direct and vicarious extinction in youth and their relative contribution to PTSD, 2) examine neural abnormalities during direct and vicarious extinction in adolescent PTSD, and 3) determine whether adding vicarious extinction markers enhances machine learning classification of youth trauma and PTSD status. This ambitious program of parent-child extinction learning promises to yield the first comprehensive set of neurophysiological markers of pediatric PTSD that will allow for objective, rational targeting of treatment in the parent-child dyad to improve outcomes for afflicted youth. Project Narrative This project seeks to conduct the first comprehensive, biological study of how parent-child fear and safety learning contribute to adolescent PTSD. This project will establish biomarkers of parent-child safety learning in adolescent PTSD, and test whether machine learning can use these markers to diagnose PTSD in youth. This research would represent a significant advance beyond subjective assessments currently used in clinical settings, paving the way towards biologically-based diagnosis and treatment of youth PTSD within the family context.",Neurobehavioral mechanisms of parent-child extinction learning in adolescent PTSD,9683972,R01MH117141,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdala ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' cognitive behavioral treatment ', ' cognitive behavioral therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral modification ', ' cognitive behavioral intervention ', ' cognitive behavior therapy ', ' cognitive behavior modification ', ' cognitive behavior intervention ', ' Cognitive Psychotherapy ', ' Cognition Therapy ', ' Cognitive Therapy ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Emotions ', ' Exhibits ', ' behavioral extinction ', ' Extinction ', ' Extinction (Psychology) ', ' Family ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' Female ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' skin conductance ', ' Skin Electric Conductance ', ' Psychogalvanic Reflex ', ' Electrodermal Response ', ' Galvanic Skin Response ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hippocampus ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' Learning ', ' male ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' neurophysiological ', ' neurophysiology ', ' Parents ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Safety ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' PTSD ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Training ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Stimulus ', ' learning extinction ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Severities ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' neural circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' girls ', ' response ', ' Address ', ' Biological Testing ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Functional Imaging ', ' physiological imaging ', ' Physiologic Imaging ', ' Scheme ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' caregiving ', ' care giving ', ' neurobehavioral ', ' Face Processing ', ' facial processing ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' Trauma ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Impairment ', ' standard care ', ' standard treatment ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' early adolescence ', ' Structural defect ', ' structural anomalies ', ' structural abnormalities ', ' Structural malformation ', ' imaging platform ', ' predicting response ', ' response prediction ', ' predictor of response ', ' predictive response ', ' prediction of response ', ' improved outcome ', ' recruit ', ' trauma exposure ', ' exposure to trauma ', ' Sex Differences ', ' sex-specific differences ', ' sex-related differences ', ' sex-dependent differences ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2019,735621,WI-02,0.08362676576143796
"Predicting the onset of depression in at-risk adolescents from endophenotype profiles Project Summary/Abstract  Major depressive disorder (MDD) is uncommon in childhood, but becomes increasingly prevalent during adolescence. By the age of 18, about 15% of adolescents will have experienced at least one episode of MDD, with females twice as likely than males to have suffered an episode. This developmental surge in depression is especially high among teens who have a parent with a history of MDD, with close to half developing the disorder by the end of adolescence. Despite these epidemiological findings, and the range of negative downstream consequences linked to MDD, there are strikingly little data on the neural and behavioral abnormalities that confer risk for future depression onset in youth. The ability to prospectively predict MDD prior to its onset would have important clinical implications for the early identification of – and targeted deployment of interventions for – at-risk youth, which is strongly aligned with the NIMH Strategic Plan.  To address these gaps, adolescents ages 12-15 at increased risk of MDD onset by virtue of a parental history of MDD, as well as a control sample with no parental history of depression, will complete baseline neural (fMRI) and behavioral assessments of replicated endophenotypes of MDD (neuroticism, anhedonia, cognitive control deficits). Growing evidence and our preliminary data suggest that these endophenotypes are relatively stable trait-like risk markers, have non-overlapping neural substrates, and precede and prospectively predict depression onset. The project has three aims. First, we will evaluate the neural correlates of these three endophenotypes in an adolescent sample (n = 148), half of whom are at elevated risk of MDD (Aim 1). Second, during a 24-month follow-up phase, participants will be contacted by phone every 6 months and administered measures to assess changes in symptoms. Analyses will test whether behavioral and neural endophenotype measures prospectively predict onset of depressive symptoms during the follow-up phase. Importantly, to evaluate incremental predictive validity, we will test whether each endophenotype measure predicts future depressive symptoms above and beyond relevant clinical, familial/demographic and developmental variables previously linked with risk of future depression (Aim 2). Third, we will test whether multivariate machine learning models incorporating behavioral and neural endophenotype markers, as well as clinical, familial/demographic, and developmental characteristics, can be used to predict subject-specific risk of future depression onset with sufficiently high sensitivity and specificity to be clinically useful (Aim 3). Critically, recent advances in machine learning allow for the development of algorithms predicting risk at the individual level, as well as the integration of numerous predictors rather than relying on single variables that may, in isolation, have limited clinically-useful predictive value. Collectively, results are expected to advance our ability to predict the onset of depressive symptoms and, ultimately, to inform the development of a freely available, web-based risk calculator for predicting subject-specific depression risk. Project Narrative The prevalence of depression increases dramatically during adolescence, particularly for females. Using machine learning algorithms, the overarching goal of the project is to identify neural and behavioral markers that – in combination with clinical and demographic characteristics – reliably predict risk of developing depression during adolescence. The ability to prospectively predict depression prior to its initial onset would have important clinical implications for the early identification of – and targeted deployment of interventions for – at-risk youth.",Predicting the onset of depression in at-risk adolescents from endophenotype profiles,9681505,R01MH116969,"['Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Behavior ', ' Cluster Analyses ', ' Cluster Analysis ', ' Conflict ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Control Groups ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' indexing ', ' Inventory ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' single episode Major Depression ', ' major depressive episode ', ' Single major depressive episode ', ' Single major depression ', ' single episode major depressive disorder ', ' male ', ' Maps ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neuroticism ', ' neurotic ', ' Psychoneuroses ', ' Neuroses ', ' Neurotic Disorders ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' Parents ', ' Research ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Testing ', ' Measures ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' surrogate biomarkers ', ' surrogate bio-markers ', ' Surrogate Markers ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Anhedonia ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Individual ', ' Onset of illness ', ' disorder onset ', ' disease onset ', ' Depressed mood ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' Disease remission ', ' Remission ', ' experience ', ' behavior measurement ', ' behavioral measurement ', ' behavioral measure ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' trait ', ' pleasure ', ' Participant ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Early identification ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' behavioral assessment ', ' Behavior assessment ', ' major depression disorder ', ' major depression ', ' clinical depression ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Subgroup ', ' Risk Marker ', ' Teenagers ', ' teenage ', ' teen years ', ' Teen ', ' Characteristics ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' cognitive system ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' endophenotype ', ' cognitive control ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' RDoC ', ' Positive Valence ', ' Negative Valence ', ' anxiety symptoms ', ' anxious symptom ', ' neural correlate ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' recruit ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' ']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,R01,2019,584268,MA-05,0.05904836926585357
"Using Administrative and Clinical Data to Detect Drug Use and HIV Risk in Foster Care USING ADMINISTRATIVE AND CLINICAL DATA TO DETECT DRUG USE AND HIV RISK IN FOSTER CARE Project Summary  The candidate's goal is to develop an independent research career as a developmental psychologist focused on identifying mechanisms to prevent the onset of pervasive and detrimental health risk behaviors, including substance abuse and HIV risk behaviors, among adolescents and young adults involved in foster care. She has experience in examining psychosocial and behavioral processes during this period of development and a strong publication record for the current phase in her career. Her previous training has emphasized development during adolescence and the transition to adulthood and health behaviors during this timeframe. In the K01, she proposes to expand her training to become an expert leader in team science approaches to address substance use and HIV risk behaviors during adolescence and the transition to adulthood, specifically focusing on foster youth, using child welfare administrative data and electronic medical records (EMR). Her training will emphasize: 1) development as an independent researcher and leader in interdisciplinary approaches to addressing health and development among foster youth, 2) substantive training in child maltreatment, substance use, and HIV risk behaviors, and 3) the use of machine learning to distinguish youth at risk, with the end goal of identifying opportunities for prevention. This will be accomplished through seminars and journal clubs offered at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC), attending regional and national conferences and trainings on substantive topics, and completion of coursework in child maltreatment and machine learning. Finally, she will complete coursework and seminars addressing the ethical conduct of research. Dr. Beal's goal is to submit an R01, as PI, during the third year of this grant.  CCHMC, one of the top three pediatric research hospitals in the nation, is committed to Dr. Beal's career development. The research environment at CCHMC and within the Division of Behavioral Medicine and Clinical Psychology, and the mentors and collaborators identified in this proposal, are well-suited to Dr. Beal's interests and research goals. Dr. Beal will be co-mentored by Dr. Jennie Noll and Dr. Robert Ammerman. Dr. Noll has extensive experience as a researcher examining the impact of child maltreatment on adolescent development, particularly around sexual risk behaviors. Dr. Ammerman is a well-established researcher with expertise in prevention and intervention programs for high-risk populations. Her advisory committee includes Dr. Melissa Jonson-Reid, an internationally recognized researcher in child welfare and the use of administrative records, Dr. John Schulenberg, developmental psychologist and authority in adolescent and young adult substance use, Dr. Jessica Kahn, expert in adolescent medicine and sexual and HIV risk behaviors, and Dr. John Pestian, leader in machine learning and its application to clinical care. These individuals have made a commitment to mentor and guide Dr. Beal in research and career development.  The objective of this research program is to fill a gap in our current understanding of which adolescents in foster care are at greatest risk for substance use and HIV while simultaneously providing a means for establishing Dr. Beal's independence as a researcher. There are two aims of this proposal. Aim 1 uses discrete time survival analyses and linked child welfare and EMR data to examine the onset and prevalence of substance use and HIV risk behaviors for youth ages 10-20 in foster care compared to matched Medicaid-eligible youth not in foster care (Foster care n=2836; 1-to-1 matched comparison from ~9585 primary care patients). Findings will provide estimates of the rates of substance use and HIV risk behaviors across ages 10-20 and when they increase/decrease, which is critical for identifying the ideal time to begin prevention and intervention efforts. Aim 2 will draw on causal inference techniques and machine learning to identify youth who are substance using or at substantial risk for developing HIV prior to age 21 based on two categories of risk factors: 1 – those common in adolescence, including parental substance use and mental health diagnoses; and 2 – risk factors unique to foster care, including extended time in foster care and placement instability. Analyses will be conducted using structural equation modeling to identify predictors of substance use and HIV risk behaviors. Machine learning will be used to develop classifiers that distinguish youth likely to use substances and contract HIV. This approach will, for the first time, provide a means to identify youth at risk for these negative health outcomes before youth experience these consequences. Via this approach, clinicians and front-line workers will be able to easily distinguish youth at risk and dedicate more time to prevention efforts. The proposed program of training and research will provide a clear pathway for Dr. Beal to transition as an independent researcher. This unique program of research merges her expertise in developmental science and health during adolescence and the transition to adulthood with research in child maltreatment, substance use, and HIV risk behaviors to support interdisciplinary, innovative team science approaches to prevent poor health outcomes among foster youth. The proposed studies in this application are significant because the findings take a developmental perspective to provide clinically useful information about which youth are at risk for poor health outcomes. Such an approach is innovative and will transform prevention delivery efforts for vulnerable foster youth. PROJECT NARRATIVE (PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE) Teens in foster care are at increased risk for substance abuse and contracting HIV compared to their peers, in addition to experiencing poor education, work, and psychosocial outcomes; leveraging administrative child welfare data linked to electronic medical records data for foster youth affords the opportunity to examine key factors that contribute to risk. The goal if this application is to identify youth at risk for substance abuse and HIV, with an eye toward designing intervention and prevention efforts that front-line workers and providers can enact for foster youth prior to age 18 to increase the likelihood that substance abuse and HIV in adulthood can be prevented. The concepts learned through this grant, as well as the career development pursued by the investigator, will be readily applicable to foster youth in child welfare and healthcare settings and could lead to innovations previously unachieved with this challenging and vulnerable adolescent population.",Using Administrative and Clinical Data to Detect Drug Use and HIV Risk in Foster

"Using Re-inforcement Learning to Automatically Adapt a Remote Therapy Intervention (RTI) for Reducing Adolescent Violence Involvement Youth violence is a key public health problem. Homicide is a leading cause of death among adolescents (age:14- 20) and disproportionately impacts African-American populations. Urban EDs are a critical opportunity for violence prevention, especially with >600,000 adolescents/year seeking treatment for violence-related injuries. In our longitudinal study of violently-injured adolescents in urban EDs, we found that within 2-years, 37% returned for a repeat violent injury, 59% experienced firearm violence, 38% were arrested, and 1% died. Despite the importance of the problem, strategies to decrease repeat violence after an ED visit have not been well studied. Given our prior work demonstrating that theoretically-based single session ED interventions are efficacious reducing violence among lower risk adolescents, the application of this therapy, expanded to address greater problem severity over multiple sessions and enhanced by including care management, represents a potentially efficacious approach for altering risk trajectories of higher-risk violently-injured adolescents. Our recent pilot of this approach (S-RTI) was well received and addressed problems identified in prior multisession interventions (e.g., transportation) with the addition of remote therapy delivery (e.g., phone). While innovative and promising, this S-RTI approach is resource intensive and does not address heterogeneity in treatment responses. By contrast, adaptive treatment strategies allow for “just-in-time” tailoring that provides a balance between too much and not enough intervention and enhances outcomes while reducing the use of costly resources. Reinforcement learning is an artificial intelligence domain that allows computer systems to “learn” from the success of prior treatments and is a promising approach to constructing adaptive “just-in-time” interventions. For this study, we propose to test two versions of our RTI, a standard RTI condition (S-RTI) comprised of a single ED session followed by 8 remote therapy sessions, and an adaptive RTI version (AI-RTI) optimized by reinforcement learning to step up or down the intensity of treatment between three levels (i.e., remote therapy sessions, automated two- way text messaging, assessment only) based on patient response to daily text message assessments. The specific aims are: 1) To refine and adapt our RTI for delivery using two packages (S-RTI; AI-RTI); 2) To conduct a 3-arm RCT enrolling 900 violently-injured adolescents seeking ED care (age:14-20) to compare the efficacy of S-RTI (n=300), AI-RTI (n=400), and a control condition (n=200); and, 3) To evaluate adaptability of the AI-RTI RL algorithm by comparing the first 50% of enrollees to the second 50% on process variables (e.g., engagement, helpfulness/likability). Primary outcomes (assessed at 4-, 8-, and 12-months) include aggression, victimization, and ED recidivism for violent injury. Secondary outcomes include substance use, mental health symptoms, and criminal justice involvement. As a secondary aim, we will compare resource utilization (i.e., costs/event averted) for the active intervention conditions. Given elevated rates of violence among socio-disadvantaged youth with disparities in access to services, the proposed study has the potential for significant public health impact. PROJECT NARRATIVE Homicide is a leading cause of death among adolescent youth, and disproportionately affects African-American populations. This study, conducted among a sample of adolescents (14-20 years old) seeking treatment in an urban emergency department (ED) for violent injuries, aims to refine, adapt, and test two versions of our previously piloted violence intervention, a standard remote therapy condition (S-RTI) comprised of a single ED therapy session followed by 8 remote therapy sessions and an adaptive RTI version (AI-RTI) optimized by an artificial intelligence algorithm (i.e., reinforcement learning) to step up or down the intensity of treatment between three treatment levels (i.e., remote therapy sessions, automated two-way text messaging, assessment only) based on patient response to daily text message assessments.

"ABCD-USA Consortium:Research Project DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period that is associated with dramatic increases in rates of substance use. Identifying predictors of substance use and its effects on child and adolescent development is critically important, as substance-related decrements incurred during ongoing maturation could have long- lasting effects on brain functioning and behavioral, health, and psychological outcomes. In response to RFA- DA-15-015, this application proposes the University of Pittsburgh Research Project Site component [12/13] of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD)-USA consortium to prospectively determine the neurodevelopmental and behavioral effects of substance on children and adolescents. In Pittsburgh, a representative community sample of 550 9-10 year old substance-naïve children will be recruited (total ABCD- USA n=11,111 from 11 total sites) and will undergo a baseline assessment and two to three follow-ups over a five year period. At each assessment period, participants will undergo state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, and extensive assessment of substance use patterns and mental health functioning. The brain, behavioral, psychological, social, genetic, and environmental data collected during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects o substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the ""gateway interactions"" between use of different substances. Elements Unique to This Site: In addition, ABCD-USA Pittsburgh will provide a unique focus determining how the cognitive dimensions of working memory and inhibitory control and the maturation of corticostriatal systems can inform our understanding of the risks for and effects of early adolescent marijuana use. Working memory and inhibitory control improve during adolescence in parallel with maturation of underlying corticostriatal neurocircuitry. An understanding of these areas of adolescent brain and cognitive development provide critical information in models determining vulnerabilities for and consequences of marijuana and other substance use. In Y03, Pittsburgh will focus on analyses examining working memory and inhibitory control phenotypes and neurodevelopmental characteristics prior to substance use. In Y04-Y05, these neurocognitive characteristics will be examined as risks for early adolescent marijuana use trajectories and, in Y10, accelerated adolescent marijuana use trajectories. Machine Learning will be applied to integrating cognitive and neuroimaging features to characterize a model of risks for early adolescent marijuana use. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ABCD-USA Consortium will use multimodal brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, mobile monitoring, and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning in 11,111 adolescents followed over 10 years to determine the effects of substance use on adolescent brain and cognitive development. Our 12/13 ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project will recruit and assess 550 youth age 9-10 at project entry. In addition to contributions to the overall consortium, our U01 will specifically focus on the effects of adolescent marijuana use on working memory, inhibitory control and corticostriatal systems.",ABCD-USA Consortium:Research Project,9691298,U01DA041028,"['Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Child Development ', ' Cognition ', ' Communities ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Institutes ', ' longterm study ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' marihuana ', ' Marijuana ', ' working memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methodology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurobiology ', ' Neuropsychologic Tests ', ' Neuropsychological Tests ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Phenotype ', ' Psychiatry ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Standardization ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Technology ', ' Universities ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' improved ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Individual ', ' nonhuman primate ', ' non-human primate ', ' Logistics ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Genetic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' cognitive function ', ' Dimensions ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' Services ', ' misuse of prescription only drugs ', ' prescription misuse ', ' prescription drug misuse ', ' nonmedical prescription drug use ', ' non-medical prescription drug use ', ' Prescription medication misuse ', ' experience ', ' Informatics ', ' Biologic Development ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' Participant ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' Modality ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' neural circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Adolescent Development ', ' behavioral health ', ' response ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Program Research Project Grants ', ' Research Program Projects ', ' Program Project Grant ', ' P01 Program ', ' P01 Mechanism ', ' Cognitive ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' early onset ', ' adolescent substance use ', ' youth substance use ', ' substance use among youth ', ' substance use among adolescents ', ' time use ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' Social Functioning ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Outcome ', ' psychological outcomes ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' 10 year old ', ' ten years of age ', ' ten year old ', ' age 10 years ', ' 10 years of age ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' emerging adult ', ' early adulthood ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' Adolescent marijuana use ', ' marijuana use in adolescence ', ' marijuana use among adolescents ', ' cannabis use among adolescents ', ' cognitive task ', ' cognitive development ', ' marijuana use ', ' cannabis use ', ' THC use ', ' THC co-use ', ' Department chair ', ' translational research program ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' recruit ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,U01,2019,990000,PA-18,0.1569534731786847
"Technology-Enhanced Family-Focused Treatment for Adolescents at High Risk for Mood Disorders PROJECT SUMMARY  This proposal responds to RFA-MH-17-612, “Pilot Effectiveness Trials for Treatment, Preventive and Services Interventions (R34).” We have shown in several randomized trials that family-focused therapy (FFT) for symptomatic youth at high-risk for bipolar disorder - consisting of psychoeducation and family communication and problem solving skills training - is an effective adjunct to pharmacotherapy in hastening symptomatic recovery. However, between 50%-60% of high-risk youth still have residual mood symptoms and functional impairment after 18 weeks of FFT. In our prior studies, two constructs have emerged as predictors of lack of response to treatment: mood instability in the child and expressed emotion (EE) in parents (i.e., frequent critical comments or hostility). In adolescents (ages 12-18) with a parent with bipolar disorder or major depressive disorder, we hypothesize that augmenting FFT with frequent and targeted interventions in the home setting through a Smartphone app (MyCoachConnect, or MCC) will (a) have a greater and more rapid impact than standard FFT on the targeted mechanisms of mood instability in adolescents and EE in parents, and (b) as a result, enhance symptom resolution and functioning in adolescents. To be eligible, adolescents must score high on parent-rated measures of mood instability, and have at least one parent who is high-EE by speech sample coding criteria. The MCC app will record weekly open speech samples from parents and children and daily and weekly mood ratings from adolescents. The app assessments will be fed back to the FFT clinician, who will use this information to “push” recommendations for mood regulation, communication, and problem-solving strategies (linked to the FFT modules) for parents and youth. In year 1, we will conduct an open trial (n=25) to determine (a) the feasibility and acceptability of FFT with mobile coaching (FFT-MCC), as given by clinicians in community settings, and (b) associations between online/speech feature proxies of the targets (mood instability and EE as measured weekly by MCC) and standard measures of the targets. In years 2 and 3 we will conduct a 75- case RCT in which families are assigned to FFT with MCC skills coaching, FFT with MCC assessments only, with no coaching; or FFT Only, without MCC. We hypothesize that FFT-MCC will be acceptable to parents, adolescents and clinicians, and more effective than FFT without MCC coaching or FFT-Only in engaging the targets of mood instability and EE and promoting improvements in adolescents' mood symptoms and quality of life over 27 weeks. The study will facilitate the translation of a technological augmentation to an evidence-based family intervention, with the goal of increasing treatment access among families with mood disorders. Project Narrative/Relevance We propose to enhance the scalability of family-focused therapy (FFT), a 12-session evidence- based therapy for youth at high risk for mood disorders, through augmentation with a novel mobile phone application called MyCoachConnect (MCC). In adolescents with mood instability who have a parent with bipolar or major depressive disorder, clinicians in community clinics will conduct FFT sessions (consisting of psychoeducation and family skills training) supplemented by weekly MCC “real time” assessments of moods and family relationships; based on results of these assessments and the family's progress in treatment, clinicians will then push personalized informational and coaching alerts regarding the practice of communication and problem-solving skills. We hypothesize that the augmented version of FFT (FFT-MCC) will be more effective than FFT without coaching/informational alerts in altering treatment targets and in stabilizing youths' mood symptoms and quality of life.",Technology-Enhanced Family-Focused Treatment for Adolescents at High Risk for Mood Disorders,9933291,R34MH117200,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', '

"MoodRing: A multi-stakeholder platform to monitor and manage adolescents' depression in primary care with passive mobile sensing. ABSTRACT As rates of adolescent depression and suicidality continue to trend upwards, the healthcare system struggles to address the need for and lack of mental health service use. The pediatric patient-centered medical home model may improve adolescent depression outcomes by enhancing access to and coordinating care, as well as providing ongoing monitoring. Unfortunately, despite guideline recommendations, over 2/3 of adolescents identified with depression symptoms in primary care do not receive symptom monitoring and 19% do not re- ceive symptom reassessment. This lack of symptom monitoring and reassessment can result in untoward health outcomes including a decrease in functioning, increased use of acute and crisis services, and hospitali- zations due to suicidality. Current technologies which incorporate data passively collected from smartphones offer an opportunity for intercurrent monitoring between patient visits which limits burden on the patient to self- report and limits burden on the healthcare system, allowing primary care teams to triage contacting and as- sessing patients a system identifies with an increase in disease severity. This formative study will demonstrate the usability and potential clinical utility of MoodRing, a technology intervention which will collect passive mo- bile phone sensor data on aspects of adolescent phone use related to depressive symptom severity (e.g. com- munication patterns, social media use, travel) and integrate this data into a multi-user (adolescent, parent, pri- mary care provider/care manager) platform from which symptoms can be viewed and secure communication can occur. MoodRing, as supported by Health Belief Model, may lead to improved quality of depression man- agement (increased symptom reassessment, therapy/medication adherence) through increasing self-efficacy, social support from parent and care team, as well as encouraging application of self-management skills through increased self-management knowledge, skills, and symptom feedback. MoodRing builds on a solid foundation of investigators experienced in design of technology interventions to increase adolescent initiation of depression treatment, who have already developed machine algorithms for passive sensing and a small business partner with vast experience in working with health researchers to develop multi-user web/mobile platforms. This STTR Phase I study seeks to accomplish two aims. The first is to apply a machine learning pipeline developed for college-aged youth to adolescents with depression and determine whether self-reported depressive symptoms can be reliably predicted from passive data with at least 85% accuracy. The second is the user design and system architecture of MoodRing. If milestones are achieved that models are successful at predicting depressive symptoms and the proposed MoodRing intervention is acceptable to adolescents, par- ents, and primary care providers/care managers, then we will pursue the STTR Phase II study. The aims of Phase II include the development and subsequent efficacy trial of MoodRing. Specifically, we will conduct a cluster randomized controlled trial in a primary care setting of MoodRing as compared to usual care. PROJECT NARRATIVE Depression affects up to a fifth of adolescents but less than half get treatment. This project aims to develop and design MoodRing, a technology platform, which will gather information about how an adolescent uses their mobile phone and translate that into what it means about symptoms of depression they are experiencing. This platform will provide symptom feedback to the adolescent themselves, their parent, and their healthcare pro- vider, with the goal that having awareness of symptoms and a safe place to communicate with parents and healthcare providers will allow for more adolescents to better self-manage their mood and get better quality treatment for depression.",MoodRing: A multi-stakeholder platform to

"Predicting Substance Use and Related Antisocial Behavior with Psychiatric, Socioeconomic, and Brain Measures in Women Offenders Project Summary/Abstract Substance use costs society $740 billion dollars each year, placing an enormous burden on our nation’s health care and criminal justice systems. Approximately 85% of incarcerated offenders in the United States have a history of substance use and/or are imprisoned for crimes involving or motivated by alcohol and/or drug use. Incarcerated individuals tend to show poorer outcomes following substance use treatment, and forced abstinence via imprisonment is associated with risk for future substance use, which likely contributes to substance-related antisocial behavior following imprisonment. Over the past few decades, women have been sentenced to prison for drug-related reasons at alarming rates, with a growth rate exceeding that for men. Further, women offenders tend to be impacted more heavily by substance use with co-morbid psychopathology, placing greater demands on the system in terms of substance use and mental health treatments. Using the world’s largest forensic neuroimaging database on women offenders (SWANC-F), this proposal investigates substance use and related antisocial behavior following release from prison in a large sample of women offenders, with a focus on neurobiological mechanisms, to demonstrate the utility of brain measures in estimating long-term substance use outcomes in at-risk women. Substance-related antisocial behavior, defined as committing crime(s) related to substance use after release from prison, will be obtained from re-arrest data in institutional files and comprehensive background checks on all women enrolled in the study. A random sample (n = 100) will then be followed-up with via phone to gather data on substance use and obtain supplemental information to corroborate re-arrest data from files and background checks. Employing regression analyses and machine learning/pattern classifier approaches, models will be compared testing effects of psychiatric and socioeconomic variables, along with resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) brain measures, to examine unique and combined effects in differentiating among heterogeneous etiological mechanisms driving substance use outcomes of interest in women. Specifically, this proposal seeks to test the extent to which psychiatric and socioeconomic factors confer risk for substance-related antisocial behavior following release from prison in women (Aim 1), and integrates and compares the utility of rsFC brain measures in improving these prediction models (Aim 2). Then, similar methods will be applied to test the prediction of substance use following release from prison (Aim 3). It is expected that psychiatric risk factors and socioeconomic protective factors, as well as rsFC brain measures, will be useful in predicting substance use and related antisocial behavior following incarceration, along with time elapsed between release from prison and initiation of substance use and related behavior. Testing factors that aid in predicting these behaviors in women has the potential to be far-reaching by informing the development of targeted treatments, including those that help to account for sex differences and co-morbid conditions related to substance use. Project Narrative Women represent one of the fastest growing segments of substance users in the United States, with a growth rate of substance-related offending exceeding that of men; however, women continue to be one of the most underserved populations in substance use research. This proposal will compare statistical models testing effects of psychiatric and socioeconomic factors, along with resting-state functional connectivity in and between cognitive control, decision-making, and reward-processing neural circuitry, to examine unique and combined effects in differentiating among heterogeneous etiological mechanisms driving substance use outcomes in women. The primary goal of this proposal is to examine the utility of brain measures in estimating long-term substance use outcomes in at-risk women in an effort to help inform future treatment efforts.","Predicting Substance Use and Related Antisocial Behavior with Psychiatric, Socioeconomic, and Brain Measures in Women Offenders",9758947,F31DA047048,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' EtOH use ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Anxiety ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Crime ', ' Decision Making ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Economics ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Employment ', ' Factor One ', ' Factor I ', ' Coagulation Factor One ', ' Coagulation Factor I ', ' Blood Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor I ', ' Fibrinogen ', ' Forensics ', ' Forensic Medicine ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Island of Reil ', ' Insula ', ' Central Lobe ', ' Insula of Reil ', ' Marital Status ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Moods ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Risk Ratio ', ' Relative Odds ', ' Cross-Product Ratio ', ' Odds Ratio ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Personality ', ' Play ', ' Prisons ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' Statistical Regression ', ' Regression Diagnostics ', ' Regression Analyses ', ' Regression Analysis ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Societies ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Technology ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Criminal Justice ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Anterior ', ' Clinical ', ' Imprisonment ', ' incarceration ', ' incarcerated ', ' Biological ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Individual ', ' Data Files ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Logistics ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Sample Size ', ' Funding ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' Performance ', ' hazard ', ' 4-aminospiroperidol ', ' ASPD ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' novel ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' offender ', ' criminal offender ', ' social ', ' anti social ', ' antisocial ', ' neural circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Brain region ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' pediatric trauma ', ' childhood trauma ', ' adolescent trauma ', ' cost ', ' psychopathic personality ', ' psychopathy ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Abstinence ', ' data structure ', ' reward processing ', ' cognitive control ', ' neurobiological mechanism ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' anxiety symptoms ', ' anxious symptom ', ' antisocial behavior ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' protective factors ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' Sex Differences ', ' sex-specific differences ', ' sex-related differences ', ' sex-dependent differences ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO,F31,2019,35547,NM-01,0.06896177456543515
"Missing Data Matters: Substance Use Disorder Clinical Trials Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Scharfstein, Daniel, Oscar Project Summary/Abstract Missing outcome data threaten the validity of randomized clinical trials because inference about treatment effects then necessarily relies on untestable assumptions, which wrongly stated can lead to incorrect conclusions. While it is widely recognized that evaluating the sensitivity of trial results to assumptions about the missing data mech- anism should be a mandatory component of reporting, rigorous sensitivity analyses are not routinely reported. Likely explanations include inadequate knowledge translation by statistical methodologists to both principal in- vestigators and their statistical collaborators as well as lack of software. Substance use disorder clinical trials are known to suffer from high rates of missing data. Unlike regulatory trials where missing data are primarily the result of premature study withdrawal, individuals in substance use disorder trials tend to intermittently skip their scheduled outcome assessments. This produces an explosion of “non-monotone” missing data patterns that makes sensitivity analysis methodologically and computationally chal- lenging. There has been relatively little research on sensitivity analysis procedures for analyzing such data and the procedures that have been developed are anchored to assumptions that are problematic. Thus, investigators are faced with challenging analytic barriers and the conclusions they draw from their trials may be ﬂawed. In this three-year proposal, we will reanalyze 29 clinical trials conducted by NIDA's Clinical Trials Network (CTN), and made publicly available on NIDA's DataShare website, to evaluate their robustness to missing data assump- tions through rigorous sensitivity analysis. Since adequate tools for conducting sensitivity analysis of studies with highly non-monotone missing data patterns do not yet exist, we plan to develop, implement and dissemi- nate (through journal articles, short courses and webinars) an innovative sensitivity analysis methodology and open-source, user-friendly software to evaluate the robustness, to missing data assumptions, of trials in which binary outcomes (e.g., substance use) are scheduled to be repeatedly collected at ﬁxed points in time after ran- domization and participants intermittently skip their scheduled assessments. Our tool will be developed by an interdisciplinary team of biostatisticians and substance use disorder treatment experts, with input from an advi- sory board comprised of highly regarded statistical experts and leading scientists in the substance use disorder community. Through reanalysis of the NIDA's CTN trials using our tool, we will be better able to understand the impact of missing data assumptions on the evaluation of the studied interventions. Additionally, demonstrat- ing the importance and utility of our tool to our advisory board and to the substance use disorder community more broadly stands to increase the likelihood of adoption. Finally, the development, testing, and dissemination of this innovative statistical tool can serve as a template for other scientiﬁc domains, making “stress-testing” to untestable missing data assumptions a more routine component of scientiﬁc reporting.

We will utilize this tool to reanalyze data from 29 substance abuse clinical trials conducted by NIDA's Clinical Trials Network and available publicly on NIDA's DataShare web- site.

"Analyzing Sequential, Multiple Assignment, Randomized Trials in the Presence of Partial Compliance Project Summary: The cyclical and heterogeneous nature of many substance use disorders highlights the need to adapt the type or the dose of treatment to accommodate the specific and changing needs of individuals. This proposal is motivated by the Extending Treatment Effectiveness of Naltrexone and the Adaptive Treatment for Cocaine Dependence trials, sequential multiple assignment randomized trials (SMART) designed to find a (personalized) rescue treatment for alcohol or/and cocaine dependent patients. One of the main challenges in these trials is the high rate of noncompliance to the assigned treatments. This feature has made it virtually impossible for investigators to fully explore the possibility of building high quality treatment strategies using the data. Our overarching aim is to address this particular challenge through developing and subsequently applying new statistical methods to the data. A SMART trial is a multi-stage trial that can inform the design of an adaptive treatment strategy (ATS) which formalizes an individualized treatment plan and where current treatment strategy can depend on a patient's past medical and treatment history. An optimal ATS is one that maximizes a specified health outcome of interest. Existing methods in analyzing SMART data are limited to intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses. That is the treatment effect at each stage is estimated based on the treatment group to which an individual was randomized at that stage regardless of whether the individual complied with their assigned treatment. One major concern is that the relationship between the experimental manipulation and the outcome may be confounded by treatment noncompliance. We develop methodologies that can be used to adjust for noncompliance in analyzing data collected in SMARTs. Specifically, we extend the principal strata framework and Bayesian Copulas to multi-stage randomized trials setting and propose novel procedures that estimate the mean outcome under different ATSs. We also propose a novel Bayesian machine learning approach that can be used to construct deeply tailored (i.e., individualized) treatment strategies that take into account patients' demographic factors, measures of mental health and alcohol use, obsessive-compulsive drinking and alcohol craving scales, physical composite scores. Finally, we will develop easy-to-use, publicly available open-source software leveraging the R and Python languages that implements our methods. This will provide an expandable platform that will assist researchers in developing new optimal ATSs for patients suffering from alcoholism and other substance use disorders. Narrative: This project aims to address the need for robust, rigorous and computationally efficient methods for analysis of sequential multiple assignment randomized trials (SMARTs) data in the presence of partial compliance. The methods developed in this project will improve the usefulness, interpretability and generalizability of the results obtained by SMARTs and help mental health and substance use disorder scientists to develop more potent adaptive treatment strategies to guide the individualization of mental health and substance use disorder treatments.","Analyzing Sequential, Multiple Assignment, Randomized Trials in the Presence of Partial Compliance",9734801,R01DA048764,"['Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' EtOH use ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Cocaine ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Joints ', ' Language ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Maps ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Vivitrol ', ' ReVia ', ' Nemexin ', ' Nalorex ', ' Naltrexone ', ' Patients ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Periodicity ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Software Tools ', ' statistics ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' Treatment Effectiveness ', ' Intention ', ' base ', ' dosage ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Medical ', ' Pythons ', ' Individual ', ' Bayesian Method ', ' Bayesian posterior distribution ', ' Bayesian classification procedure ', ' Bayesian classification method ', ' Bayesian approaches ', ' Bayesian Statistical Method ', ' Bayesian Methodology ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Scientist ', ' non-compliance ', ' noncompliant ', ' noncompliance ', ' non-compliant ', ' interest ', ' alcohol craving ', ' ethanol craving ', ' Performance ', ' treatment planning ', ' Obsessive compulsive behavior ', ' obsessive compulsive ', ' Cocaine Dependence ', ' Cocaine Addiction ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' drinking ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' response ', ' repository ', ' alcohol abuse therapy ', ' alcohol treatment ', ' alcohol abuse treatment ', ' Effectiveness ', ' treatment compliance ', ' therapy cooperation ', ' therapy compliance ', ' patient cooperation ', ' patient adherence ', ' Patient Compliance ', ' compliance behavior ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Stratification ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' Scheme ', ' Characteristics ', ' virtual ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Alcoholism ', ' treatment effect ', ' open source ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment response ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' treatment strategy ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' arm ', ' individualized medicine ', ' unique treatment ', ' tailored treatment ', ' tailored therapy ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' individualized treatment ', ' individualized therapy ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' customized treatment ', ' customized therapy ', ' trial design ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' treatment group ', ' patient response ', ' responsive patient ', ' Bayesian learning ', ' Bayesian machine learning ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R01,2019,422197,NY-25,-0.04065371789595075
"Effects of Functional Food Diets on Cardiometabolic and Metabolomics Profiles in Minority Youth PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT This proposal outlines a career development plan to help Dr. Jaapna Dhillon complete her postdoctoral training and establish an independent research program focused on personalized dietary interventions to reduce cardiometabolic risk in minority populations. Her training will be conducted in a multidisciplinary group of scientists with research expertise in nutrition science, health disparities, molecular cell biology, metabolomics and computational biology. Her advisory team will provide an outstanding training environment that will allow her to fill critical gaps in her toolkit needed to use an integrative and personalized approach to nutrition. This award will enhance her knowledge in developing culturally sensitive nutrition interventions and cardiovascular physiology, and provide advanced training in metabolomics and computational biology. During the training phase of this award, she will strengthen her scholarly activities, establish important collaborations, and acquire critical data that will ensure her successful transition to independence. Rational: The incidence of diet-related cardiometabolic disorders is increasing at an alarming rate in racial/ethnic minority groups such as Asians and Hispanics, and are much higher than Non-Hispanic Whites in the United States. [8]. However, whether improvements in diet quality will influence minority groups at high risk of cardiometabolic diseases differentially than Whites at high risk is not well understood. Functional foods such as nuts, whole grains and vegetables can help ameliorate cardiovascular disease and reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. However, most studies on functional foods and health have been overwhelmingly performed in middle-aged to older non-Hispanic White adults, with young minority populations being greatly neglected. Adapting a functional food diet at earlier life stages may prevent or ameliorate metabolic disorders later in life in minority populations that are at greater risk for developing chronic metabolic diseases. Our central hypothesis is that adapting a personalized functional food diet at earlier life stages will have greater beneficial effects on carbohydrate and lipid regulation pathways in minority youth at risk for developing cardiometabolic disorders compared to White youth at risk. Design: The mentored phase study will 1) examine the effects of almonds on blood glucose regulation pathways using metabolomics techniques and 2) provide preliminary data for the development and testing of a model that can predict effects of almonds on metabolic consequences in minority youth. The independent phase study will evaluate the long term effects of a personalized diet rich in functional foods on pathways of carbohydrate and lipid regulation in relation to the gut microbiome and cardiovascular outcomes in minority youth at high risk for cardiometabolic disorders. Relevance: The proposed studies will provide an initial evidence base for the health benefits of personalized functional food interventions in minority youth. This innovative dietary strategy may be more effective at reducing risk and ameliorating diet-related cardiometabolic disorders than conventional dietary advice in this population.

"Positive Valence Systems and Manic Symptom Trajectories in Adolescent Depression PROJECT SUMMARY Depression is a heterogeneous condition with varying degrees of severity and different etiologies that contrib- ute to variability in course trajectory and psychosocial functioning. About a third of adolescents with depression exhibit manic symptoms and as such, this substantially increases the risk for psychosocial impairment and sui- cidality. Yet, few studies have examined the pathophysiology of manic symptoms in adolescent depression and how alterations in key neural systems may be associated with changes in emotional, cognitive, and behavioral functioning. This project will address this important gap by employing a dimensional approach and a longitudi- nal design to examine neural, emotional, cognitive, and behavioral substrates of manic symptoms in (non- bipolar) depressed adolescents. Given evidence that manic symptoms implicate dysregulation of emotion and behavior, the current project will test the overarching hypothesis that alterations in connectivity of fronto- striatal-limbic (FSL) circuitry underlying cognitive control of positive emotion and reward and associated altera- tions in RDoC domain-related (emotional, cognitive, behavioral) measures of functioning in Cognitive and Posi- tive Valence Systems could differentiate depressed adolescents with from those without co-occurring manic symptoms. We aim to test this model in a longitudinal study of 180 mid-/post-pubertal adolescents (12-17 years old), including 140 adolescents with clinically significant depressive symptoms varying in manic symp- toms and 40 age- and sex- matched healthy youth. In accordance with the NIMH RDoC initiative, all depressed adolescents will be recruited from treatment settings based on the presence of clinically significant depression symptoms, irrespective of their categorical depressive disorder diagnosis. The project includes at baseline: a) fMRI paradigms measuring functioning of FSL circuitry associated with cognitive control of positive emotion and reward, b) resting state and diffusion tensor imaging, and c) out-of-the scanner neurocognitive tasks (e.g., approach-avoidance). RDoC domain-related emotional (e.g., elated mood), cognitive (e.g., delay discounting), and behavioral (e.g., impulsivity) functioning and levels of arousal will be assessed using a multi-method ap- proach (e.g., computer tasks in the lab and ecologically-valid web-based mood and actigraphy measures) at baseline and repeated bi-annually over 2 years post-scan. In addition, using machine learning algorithms, ex- ploratory analyses will be performed to identify patterns of baseline neuroimaging data and trajectories of RDoC domain-related (emotional, cognitive, behavioral) measures that can predict levels of mood symptoms and functional impairment at 2 years. Findings from this study could help distinguish subgroups of depressed adolescents based on brain-behavioral relationships, improve early detection of manic symptoms in depressed youth, and inform personalized interventions (e.g., antidepressant vs. mood-stabilizer, type of psychotherapy). PROJECT NARRATIVE Early identification of manic symptoms (e.g., impulsive and risk taking behavior, mood lability) and its trajectories can decrease the huge and chronic burden of depressive disorders on youth, families, and society. This pro- posed longitudinal study has the potential to identify neural and behavioral markers of manic symptoms in de- pressed adolescents (without bipolar disorder). Identifying such markers has important clinical implications such as improving early detection of manic symptoms in depressed youth and informing personalized interventions for depression with mixed features (e.g., antidepressant versus mood-stabilizer or tailoring psychotherapeutic ap- proaches).  ",Positive Valence Systems and Manic Symptom Trajectories in Adolescent

The Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) is being formed to advance knowledge in this area. We propose to establish PAGES, a Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site as an integral component of the MoTrPAC. PAGES will conduct comprehensive analyses of the rat and human PA intervention MoTrPAC samples, contribute these data to public databases, help identify candidate molecular transducers of PA and elucidate new PA response mechanisms, and help develop predictive models of the individual response to PA. PAGES assay sites at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York Genome Center and Broad Institute provide the infrastructure, expertise and experience to support this large scale, comprehensive analysis of molecular changes associated with PA. PAGES aims are to 1. Work with the MoTrPAC Steering Committee in Year 1 to finalize plans and protocols; 2. Perform assays and analyses to help Identify candidate molecular transducers of the response to PA in rat models and the pathways responsible for model differences, including high-depth RNA-seq and Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS), supplemented by additional assay types such as ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq based on initial results; 3. Perform comprehensive assays and analyses of the human MoTrPAC clinical study tissue samples, including RNA-seq, WGBS, H3K27ac ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq and whole genome sequencing. 4. Collaborate with the MoTrPAC to analyze data from PAGES and other MoTrPAC analysis sites to identify candidate PA transducers and molecular mechanisms, and to develop predictive models of PA capacity and response to training. The success of PAGES and the MoTrPAC program will transform insight into the molecular networks that transduce PA into health, create an unparalleled comprehensive public PA data resource, and can provide the foundation for profound advances in the prevention and treatment of many major human diseases. Project Narrative While physical activity prevents or improves a large number of diseases, the chemical changes that occur in the body and lead to better health are not well known. As a part of a consortium of physical activity research programs working together, we will use cutting-edge approaches to comprehensively study the changes in genes and gene products caused by physical activity. This study has the potential to lead to advances in the prevention and treatment of many diseases.","PAGES: Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site",9649188,U24DK112331,"['Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Budgets ', ' Chromatin ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Elements ', ' Foundations ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Institutes ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Methods ', ' New York ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Production ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Rat ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Rattus ', ' Risk Factors ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' training module ', ' Training Activity ', ' Transducers ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' sedentary ', ' Chemicals ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Research Activity ', ' Data Storage and Retrieval ', ' data storage ', ' data retrieval ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' Deposition ', ' Deposit ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' experience ', ' human data ', ' success ', ' Prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' high throughput analysis ', ' Genomics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' genome sequencing ', ' fitness ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Analysis ', ' Rat Strains ', ' Ontology ', ' Validation ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Metadata ', ' meta data ', ' epigenomics ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' transcriptomics ', ' human disease ', ' web page ', ' webpage ', ' ChIP-seq ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing ', ' ChIP Sequencing ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' methylome ', ' bisulfite sequencing ', ' bisulfite-seq ', ' Bisulfite-based sequencing ', ' BS-seq ', ' ATAC-seq ', ' ATACseq ', ' web portal ', ' internet portal ', ' transcriptome ', ' global transcription profile ', ' global gene expression ', ' exercise intervention ', ' physical activity intervention ', ' gene product ', ' whole genome ', ' full genome ', ' entire genome ', ' data resource ', ' Cost efficiency ', ' individual response ', ' individualized response ', ' Infrastructure ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' analysis pipeline ', ' mortality risk ', ' death risk ', ' ']",NIDDK,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U24,2019,2593647,NY-13,0.031703489677376406
"ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period associated with dramatic increases in rates of substance use. Identifying the pathways to substance use and its effects on child and adolescent development is critically important, as the effects of substance use during ongoing maturation likely have long-lasting effects on brain functioning and behavioral, health, and psychological outcomes. This Research Project Site application from the University of California, San Diego and Laureate Institute for Brain Research is in response to RFA-DA-15-015 as part of the ABCD-USA Consortium (5/13), to prospectively determine the neurodevelopmental and behavioral predictors and consequences of substance use on children and adolescents. A representative community sample of 1086 9-10 year olds enriched for high- risk characteristics will be recruited, contributing to the sample of 11,111 to be collected from 11 hubs across the ABCD- USA Consortium. All participants will undergo a comprehensive baseline assessment, including state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, bioassays, mobile monitoring and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning every 2 years. Interim annual interviews and quarterly web-based assessments will provide refined temporal resolution of behaviors, development, and life events with minimal participant burden. These Consortium-wide data obtained during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects of substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the ""gateway interactions"" between use of different substances. This hub's Research Project focuses on mechanisms of substance use disorder, special populations with high use prevalence, and the use of drugs other than marijuana. (1) We will determine whether individual differences in neural processing of antireward (i.e., negative reinforcement mechanisms) in amygdala, insula, and anterior cingulate are associated with increased negative emotionality and pain, predict initiation of use and problem use, and are in turn further dysregulated by substance use. (2) We will determine whether protective environment factors and ethnic identification in minority youth are linked to healthier antireward processing and better substance use outcomes. (3) We will determine whether antireward neural processing predicts increased use of illicit drugs other than MJ including misuse of prescription drugs, if such use predicts subsequent exaggerated antireward processing, and if gateway interactions exist between substances. Finally, we will use machine learning approaches to develop a youth-specific risk calculator that will enable us to identify individually- based modifiable risk factor, providing brain-based targets of future novel prevention and intervention approaches. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ABCD-USA Consortium will use multimodal brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, mobile monitoring, and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning in 11,111 adolescents followed over 10 years to determine the effects of substance use on adolescent brain and cognitive development. Our 5/13 ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project will recruit and assess 1086 youth age 9-10 at project entry. In addition to contributions to the overall consortium, our U01 will specifically focus on negative reinforcement mechanisms of substance use disorder, special populations with high SUD prevalence, and illicit drug and prescription medication misuse among adolescents.",ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project,9952669,U01DA041089,"['Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', '

"Predicting adverse outcomes among sexual minorities and heterosexuals from a prospective study of adolescent health and wellbeing PROJECT SUMMARY Sexual minorities (lesbian, gay, bisexual and other non-heterosexual individuals) are at increased risk for numerous adverse physical and mental health outcomes, including anxiety, depression, suicidality, substance use, HIV/AIDS, asthma, cardiovascular disease, and certain forms of cancer. Despite clear documentation and replication of these health disparities, relatively little is known about their development from adolescence into adulthood. Two theories primarily dominate the literature. Minority stress models describe unique life stressors experienced only by sexual minorities (e.g., victimization and discrimination based on sexual orientation) as primary contributors to health disparities. Other models implicate both minority stress and normative psychosocial processes together as contributors to health disparities. Some such normative processes include (1) psychological adjustment and characteristics (e.g., emotion regulation/dysregulation, substance use expectancies), (2) disrupted social systems (e.g., family, peers, school), and (3) individual differences (e.g., race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, temperament). To date, most studies of both minority stress and normative processes are limited by use of cross-sectional samples of primarily Caucasian adults. Although much has been learned from these studies, they do not permit analysis of emerging health disparities across development. Existing research is therefore limited in terms of both generalizability to diverse populations, and validity of directionality inferences between observed ‘predictors’ and ‘outcomes’. My long-term career goals are to identify mechanisms leading to disparities among sexual minorities, with the goal of improving treatments for these disparities, and to develop screening tools to identify high-risk youth who would benefit from prevention programs. To reach this goal, in this project, I address existing limitations to the literature using a prospective sample of individuals who were 14-19 years old at baseline and followed for over 4 years. My goal is to describe developmental trajectories and mechanisms of health disparity development for sexual minority youth compared with heterosexual youth across a 10-year developmental window spanning ages 14- 23 years. Longitudinal outcomes include depression/anxiety, suicidality, delinquency, sleep, general physical health, disordered eating and substance use. Developmental trajectories for these outcomes will be charted by gender and sexual orientation. Confirmatory analyses based on existing literature will be conducted to examine relations between minority stress and adverse outcomes. Then, I will use machine learning to identify as-yet unknown predictors of adverse outcomes and health disparities and characterize any changes in prediction across time. Finally, I will use state-of-the art intervening variable analyses (mediation, moderation) to evaluate longitudinal mechanisms through which health disparities emerge. Findings should provide insight into mechanisms of disparity development and maintenance, informing prevention and intervention strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sexual minority youth (lesbian, gay, bisexual and other non-heterosexual individuals) experience wide-ranging disparities in mental and physical health that often persist into adulthood, yet little is known about development of these disparities. This research (1) examines developmental trajectories in mental and physical health outcomes from adolescence to young adulthood among sexual minority and matched heterosexual youth, (2) uses advanced statistical methods (e.g., machine learning) to identify hypothesized and currently unknown factors that predict disparities over time, and (3) elucidates pathways to adversity and resilience. Experiences of sexual minority and heterosexual youth and young adults will be compared to uncover possible differences in developmental experiences that lead to health disparities, with possible implications for prevention and intervention among a highly vulnerable population.",Predicting adverse outcomes among sexual minorities and heterosexuals from a prospective study of adolescent health and wellbeing,9760277,F31MD014052,"['Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Anxiety ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' childrearing ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' Parenting ', ' Child Rearing ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Eating Disorders ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Literature ', ' Maintenance ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Delineating neurobiological heterogeneity in internalizing symptoms using machine learning and deep phenotyping Symptom-based classification approaches based on the DSM 5 are often not supported by epidemiological, genetic, and clinical neuroimaging research and may impede the advancement of interventions that target the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying mental health disorders. A novel alternative to classifying psychopathology based on presenting clinical symptoms is to identify neurobiologically-informed biotypes. Individuals are clustered according to shared patterns of brain dysfunction using data-driven machine learning techniques to reveal the heterogeneous biological mechanisms that underlie comorbid disorders. Internalizing symptoms often first begin during development, suggesting that this is a critical period of vulnerability. Additionally, strong sex differences are found in anxiety and depressive symptoms, starting in adolescence. Thus, studies are needed that examine sex differences in the neurobiological mechanisms associated with internalizing symptoms during development. The purpose of the current study is to uncover the neurobiological heterogeneity associated with internalizing symptoms in youth. During the K99 phase, Aim 1 will use machine-learning techniques to delineate patterns of neurobiological heterogeneity among youth with anxiety and depressive disorders using multimodal neuroimaging data from a large community-based sample of over 1,200 youth studied as part of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC; Training phase). We will test these heterogeneous patterns on a hold-out sample from the same cohort to examine the model’s validity (Validation phase). While the PNC provides an ideal dataset for developing a model, it does not have paradigms relevant to fear and anxiety that would allow us to identify important phenotypic differences between biotypes. Thus, Aim 2 will evaluate the generalizability of this model in an independent sample collected during the R00 phase, and further characterize these biotypes using pertinent measures related to error and reward processing. Finally, Aim 3 will investigate how sex differences in brain development associate with heterogeneous neural patterns in internalizing symptoms. Dr. Kaczkurkin’s long-term goal is to establish an independent research program where she will use advanced multi-modal neuroimaging techniques to study the mechanisms underlying internalizing disorders in youth. This study will provide a unique opportunity to capitalize on the PNC database at the University of Pennsylvania to develop a well-validated model while also collecting a refined independent dataset, which will provide Dr. Kaczkurkin with the training and experience needed to transition to an independent research career. This study will provide critical knowledge regarding the neurobiological heterogeneity in youth with mood and anxiety disorders.

"The Digital Phenotype of Bipolar Disorder: Harnessing Technology to Identify Bipolar Mood Symptoms Project Summary Bipolar disorder (BD) is associated with significant mortality and morbidity. It typically begins in adolescence or early adulthood, an important developmental period during which higher education, first jobs, and relationships are pursued. Recurrent mood episodes during this period can have a devastating impact on a young person's ability to achieve a high quality of life as an adult. A method by which to predict the onset of mood symptoms in adolescence would create an opportunity to intervene and reduce exposure to the harmful effects of recurrent episodes. A new approach – digital phenotyping – may make this possible. Digital phenotyping is defined as the “moment-by-moment quantification of the human phenotype in situ” using data collected from smartphone sensors (accelerometer, texts, calls, GPS). Digital phenotyping has been used to identify mood changes and potential signs of relapse in adults with BD, but has not yet been applied to adolescents. We will use Beiwe, a digital phenotyping application for iOS and Android phones, to collect digital phenotypes from participants (aged 14-19) over 18-months (N=120; n=70 with BD [I, II, Other Specified], n=50 typically-developing). Over the follow-up period, participants will complete biweekly mood assessments, and both participants and caregivers will be interviewed monthly to track changes in mood/behavior. This will allow the phone sensor data collected with Beiwe to be closely linked to symptom changes. The specific aims of this project are (1) to characterize the digital phenotype of BD symptoms in adolescents, (2) to describe differences in the digital phenotypes of the BD and typically developing groups, and (3) to develop a model for predicting mood symptoms prospectively. The proposed study is consistent with all four NIMH strategic objectives for the future of mental health research. This K23 Award will provide Anna Van Meter, PhD with the necessary training and mentorship to (1) gain proficiency in computational psychiatry by learning to analyze longitudinal data using statistical and machine learning techniques, (2) build expertise in patient-oriented translational research by designing and conducting a longitudinal study with youth participants; (3) learn to employ state-of-the-art mobile technology to personalize assessment and intervention using patient data. To accomplish these training goals, Dr. Van Meter has organized an outstanding mentorship team (Anil Malhotra, MD, Jukka-Pekka Onnela, DSc, John Kane, MD, Christoph Correll, MD, and Deborah Estrin, PhD), with expertise in patient-oriented research, technology-based mental health research, computational psychiatry, bipolar disorder in youth, and computer science. The proposed study will be the first to describe the digital phenotype of BD in adolescents, a population at great risk for the onset of BD as well as the damaging effects of repeated episodes. The completion of the proposed K23 Mentored Career Award will support an innovative program of patient-oriented research, and will provide Dr. Van Meter with the skills necessary to become an independent investigator pursuing novel technological solutions to improve patients' quality of life. Project Narrative Bipolar disorder typically begins in adolescence; recurrent mood symptoms during this period can have a devastating impact on a person's ability to achieve a high quality of life. Digital phenotyping, defined as the “moment-by-moment quantification of the human phenotype in situ” using data collected from smartphone sensors, may make it possible to better understand and predict the onset of mood symptoms with minimal burden to the individual. The goal of this K23 proposal is to characterize the digital phenotype of bipolar disorder in adolescents in order to prospectively predict mood symptoms, creating an opportunity to reduce the harmful effects of recurrent episodes.",The Digital Phenotype of Bipolar Disorder: Harnessing Technology to Identify Bipolar Mood Symptoms,9806296,K23MH120505,"['Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Award ', ' Bees ', ' Behavior ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' indexing ', ' Interview ', ' Learning ', ' longterm study ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Moods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Occupations ', ' Patients ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Periodicity ', ' Phenotype ', ' pressure ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Public Health ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Sleep ', ' Speech ', ' Technology ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' Restlessness ', ' Psychomotor Restlessness ', ' Psychomotor Hyperactivity ', ' Psychomotor Excitement ', ' Psychomotor Agitation ', ' Agitation ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' career ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' prognostic ', ' Training ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' Individual ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Exposure to ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' In Situ ', ' Techniques ', ' meter ', ' computer science ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Early identification ', ' Sleep Disorders ', ' sleep problem ', ' sleep dysregulation ', ' sleep dysfunction ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' patient oriented research ', ' patient oriented study ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' K23 Program ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Award ', ' Translational Research ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Text ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cost ', ' digital ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' service utilization ', ' high risk ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' emerging adult ', ' early adulthood ', ' screening ', ' higher education ', ' mobile computing ', ' mobile technology ', ' mobile platform ', ' Accelerometer ', ' activity tracker ', ' activity monitor ', ' accelerometry ', ' Android ', ' mood symptom ', ' common symptom ', ' smartphone Application ', ' iPhone Application ', ' iPhone App ', ' iOS application ', ' iOS app ', ' Smartphone App ', ' Smart Phone Application ', ' Smart Phone App ', ' Cellular Phone Application ', ' Cellular Phone App ', ' Cell phone App ', ' Cell Phone Application ', ' Android Application ', ' Android App ', ' Text Messaging ', ' texting ', ' short message service ', ' Diurnal Rhythm ', ' diurnal variation ', ' ']",NIMH,FEINSTEIN INSTITUTE FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH,K23,2019,195480,NY-03,0.01652517906662566
"ABCD-USA Consortium: Data Analysis Center DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ABCD-USA Consortium proposes a study designed to permit the scientific community to answer important questions about the effects of substance use (SU) patterns on behavioral and brain development of adolescents. We have assembled a team of investigators with unparalleled research experience with children and adolescents, and specific expertise in adolescent SU, child and adolescent development, developmental psychopathology, longitudinal multi-site imaging, developmental neuroimaging, developmental cognitive neuroscience, genetics and imaging genetics, bioassays, epidemiology, survey research, bioinformatics, and mobile assessment technologies. We propose a comprehensive, nationwide study to be conducted at 21 sites organized into 11 hubs (over 89 million Americans, 29% of the US population, live within 50 miles of our geographically spread sites), that, uniquely, can provide a nationally representative sample and a large twin sample that together can help distinguish environmental, sociocultural, and genetic factors relevant to SU. We ensure cohesion and standardization by employing a recruitment strategy designed by a professional survey company (experience with Monitoring the Future); standardized environmental, neurocognitive and mental health assessments, MRI assessments with all scanners using harmonized Human Connectome Project procedures, and computerized data collection with real-time quality control. Developmentally tailored assessments will have stable sensitivity and construct validity across the childhood and adolescent developmental period. They minimize participant burden, yet capture even subtle changes over time in substance use, mental health, neurocognition, development, and environment, and we employ novel state-of-the-art bioassays and passive data collection from mobile devices. A detailed retention plan builds on the experience and success of our investigators. This application describes the ABCD-USA Data Analysis and Informatics Center (DAIC), which will: establish a harmonized MRI acquisition protocol, compatible with all major scanner platforms, taking advantage of recent technological advances in structural and functional MRI; establish rigorous quality control and quantitative calibration procedures to ensure accuracy and comparability of derived imaging measures across scanners and across time; implement advanced computational analysis workflows for all imaging data; implement reliable data entry, quality control, and monitoring tools for the substance use questionnaire, neurocognitive assessments, bioassay-derived measures, and mobile technologies assessment data; implement the state- of-the-art statistical analysis tools and procedures needed to integrate information across measures and modalities; and implement infrastructure and procedures for public sharing of raw- and derived data and associated tools and computational workflows, and enable interactive data exploration and analytics through a web-based Portal. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ABCD-USA Consortium will use multimodal brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, mobile monitoring, and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning in 11,111 adolescents followed over 10 years to determine the effects of substance use on adolescent brain and cognitive development.

"ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period associated with dramatic increases in rates of substance use. Identifying the pathways to substance use and its effects on child and adolescent development is critically important, as the effects of substance use during ongoing maturation likely have long-lasting effects on brain functioning and behavioral, health, and psychological outcomes. This Research Project Site application from the University of California, San Diego and Laureate Institute for Brain Research is in response to RFA-DA-15-015 as part of the ABCD-USA Consortium (5/13), to prospectively determine the neurodevelopmental and behavioral predictors and consequences of substance use on children and adolescents. A representative community sample of 1086 9-10 year olds enriched for high- risk characteristics will be recruited, contributing to the sample of 11,111 to be collected from 11 hubs across the ABCD- USA Consortium. All participants will undergo a comprehensive baseline assessment, including state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, bioassays, mobile monitoring and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning every 2 years. Interim annual interviews and quarterly web-based assessments will provide refined temporal resolution of behaviors, development, and life events with minimal participant burden. These Consortium-wide data obtained during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects of substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the ""gateway interactions"" between use of different substances. This hub's Research Project focuses on mechanisms of substance use disorder, special populations with high use prevalence, and the use of drugs other than marijuana. (1) We will determine whether individual differences in neural processing of antireward (i.e., negative reinforcement mechanisms) in amygdala, insula, and anterior cingulate are associated with increased negative emotionality and pain, predict initiation of use and problem use, and are in turn further dysregulated by substance use. (2) We will determine whether protective environment factors and ethnic identification in minority youth are linked to healthier antireward processing and better substance use outcomes. (3) We will determine whether antireward neural processing predicts increased use of illicit drugs other than MJ including misuse of prescription drugs, if such use predicts subsequent exaggerated antireward processing, and if gateway interactions exist between substances. Finally, we will use machine learning approaches to develop a youth-specific risk calculator that will enable us to identify individually- based modifiable risk factor, providing brain-based targets of future novel prevention and intervention approaches. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ABCD-USA Consortium will use multimodal brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, mobile monitoring, and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning in 11,111 adolescents followed over 10 years to determine the effects of substance use on adolescent brain and cognitive development. Our 5/13 ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project will recruit and assess 1086 youth age 9-10 at project entry. In addition to contributions to the overall consortium, our U01 will specifically focus on negative reinforcement mechanisms of substance use disorder, special populations with high SUD prevalence, and illicit drug and prescription medication misuse among adolescents.",ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project,9697399,U01DA041089,"['Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', '

"The Digital Phenotype of Bipolar Disorder: Harnessing Technology to Identify Bipolar Mood Symptoms Project Summary Bipolar disorder (BD) is associated with significant mortality and morbidity. It typically begins in adolescence or early adulthood, an important developmental period during which higher education, first jobs, and relationships are pursued. Recurrent mood episodes during this period can have a devastating impact on a young person's ability to achieve a high quality of life as an adult. A method by which to predict the onset of mood symptoms in adolescence would create an opportunity to intervene and reduce exposure to the harmful effects of recurrent episodes. A new approach – digital phenotyping – may make this possible. Digital phenotyping is defined as the “moment-by-moment quantification of the human phenotype in situ” using data collected from smartphone sensors (accelerometer, texts, calls, GPS). Digital phenotyping has been used to identify mood changes and potential signs of relapse in adults with BD, but has not yet been applied to adolescents. We will use Beiwe, a digital phenotyping application for iOS and Android phones, to collect digital phenotypes from participants (aged 14-19) over 18-months (N=120; n=70 with BD [I, II, Other Specified], n=50 typically-developing). Over the follow-up period, participants will complete biweekly mood assessments, and both participants and caregivers will be interviewed monthly to track changes in mood/behavior. This will allow the phone sensor data collected with Beiwe to be closely linked to symptom changes. The specific aims of this project are (1) to characterize the digital phenotype of BD symptoms in adolescents, (2) to describe differences in the digital phenotypes of the BD and typically developing groups, and (3) to develop a model for predicting mood symptoms prospectively. The proposed study is consistent with all four NIMH strategic objectives for the future of mental health research. This K23 Award will provide Anna Van Meter, PhD with the necessary training and mentorship to (1) gain proficiency in computational psychiatry by learning to analyze longitudinal data using statistical and machine learning techniques, (2) build expertise in patient-oriented translational research by designing and conducting a longitudinal study with youth participants; (3) learn to employ state-of-the-art mobile technology to personalize assessment and intervention using patient data. To accomplish these training goals, Dr. Van Meter has organized an outstanding mentorship team (Anil Malhotra, MD, Jukka-Pekka Onnela, DSc, John Kane, MD, Christoph Correll, MD, and Deborah Estrin, PhD), with expertise in patient-oriented research, technology-based mental health research, computational psychiatry, bipolar disorder in youth, and computer science. The proposed study will be the first to describe the digital phenotype of BD in adolescents, a population at great risk for the onset of BD as well as the damaging effects of repeated episodes. The completion of the proposed K23 Mentored Career Award will support an innovative program of patient-oriented research, and will provide Dr. Van Meter with the skills necessary to become an independent investigator pursuing novel technological solutions to improve patients' quality of life. Project Narrative Bipolar disorder typically begins in adolescence; recurrent mood symptoms during this period can have a devastating impact on a person's ability to achieve a high quality of life. Digital phenotyping, defined as the “moment-by-moment quantification of the human phenotype in situ” using data collected from smartphone sensors, may make it possible to better understand and predict the onset of mood symptoms with minimal burden to the individual. The goal of this K23 proposal is to characterize the digital phenotype of bipolar disorder in adolescents in order to prospectively predict mood symptoms, creating an opportunity to reduce the harmful effects of recurrent episodes.",The Digital Phenotype of Bipolar Disorder: Harnessing Technology to Identify Bipolar Mood Symptoms,9996797,K23MH120505,"['Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Award ', ' Bees ', ' Behavior ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' indexing ', ' Interview ', ' Learning ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Moods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Occupations ', ' Jobs ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Patients ', ' Periodicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Phenotype ', ' pressure ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Sleep ', ' Speech ', ' Technology ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Agitation ', ' Psychomotor Agitation ', ' Psychomotor Excitement ', ' Psychomotor Hyperactivity ', ' Psychomotor Restlessness ', ' Restlessness ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' career ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' prognostic ', ' Training ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' Individual ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Exposure to ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' In Situ ', ' Techniques ', ' meter ', ' computer science ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Early identification ', ' sleep diseases ', ' sleep dysfunction ', ' sleep dysregulation ', ' sleep problem ', ' Sleep Disorders ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' patient oriented study ', ' patient oriented research ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' K23 Award ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Program ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Research ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cost ', ' digital ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' prospective ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinically significant ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' service utilization ', ' high risk ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' early adulthood ', ' emerging adult ', ' screening ', ' higher education ', ' mobile platform ', ' mobile technology ', ' mobile computing ', ' accelerometry ', ' activity monitor ', ' activity tracker ', ' Accelerometer ', ' Android ', ' mood symptom ', ' common symptom ', ' Android App ', ' Android Application ', ' Cell Phone Application ', ' Cell phone App ', ' Cellular Phone App ', ' Cellular Phone Application ', ' Smart Phone App ', ' Smart Phone Application ', ' Smartphone App ', ' iOS app ', ' iOS application ', ' iPhone App ', ' iPhone Application ', ' smartphone Application ', ' short message service ', ' texting ', ' Text Messaging ', ' diurnal variation ', ' Diurnal Rhythm ', ' statistical learning ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' ']",NIMH,FEINSTEIN INSTITUTE FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH,K23,2020,195480,NY-03,0.01652517906662566
"Effects of Functional Food Diets on Cardiometabolic and Metabolomics Profiles in Minority Youth PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT This proposal outlines a career development plan to help Dr. Jaapna Dhillon complete her postdoctoral training and establish an independent research program focused on personalized dietary interventions to reduce cardiometabolic risk in minority populations. Her training will be conducted in a multidisciplinary group of scientists with research expertise in nutrition science, health disparities, molecular cell biology, metabolomics and computational biology. Her advisory team will provide an outstanding training environment that will allow her to fill critical gaps in her toolkit needed to use an integrative and personalized approach to nutrition. This award will enhance her knowledge in developing culturally sensitive nutrition interventions and cardiovascular physiology, and provide advanced training in metabolomics and computational biology. During the training phase of this award, she will strengthen her scholarly activities, establish important collaborations, and acquire critical data that will ensure her successful transition to independence. Rational: The incidence of diet-related cardiometabolic disorders is increasing at an alarming rate in racial/ethnic minority groups such as Asians and Hispanics, and are much higher than Non-Hispanic Whites in the United States. [8]. However, whether improvements in diet quality will influence minority groups at high risk of cardiometabolic diseases differentially than Whites at high risk is not well understood. Functional foods such as nuts, whole grains and vegetables can help ameliorate cardiovascular disease and reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. However, most studies on functional foods and health have been overwhelmingly performed in middle-aged to older non-Hispanic White adults, with young minority populations being greatly neglected. Adapting a functional food diet at earlier life stages may prevent or ameliorate metabolic disorders later in life in minority populations that are at greater risk for developing chronic metabolic diseases. Our central hypothesis is that adapting a personalized functional food diet at earlier life stages will have greater beneficial effects on carbohydrate and lipid regulation pathways in minority youth at risk for developing cardiometabolic disorders compared to White youth at risk. Design: The mentored phase study will 1) examine the effects of almonds on blood glucose regulation pathways using metabolomics techniques and 2) provide preliminary data for the development and testing of a model that can predict effects of almonds on metabolic consequences in minority youth. The independent phase study will evaluate the long term effects of a personalized diet rich in functional foods on pathways of carbohydrate and lipid regulation in relation to the gut microbiome and cardiovascular outcomes in minority youth at high risk for cardiometabolic disorders. Relevance: The proposed studies will provide an initial evidence base for the health benefits of personalized functional food interventions in minority youth. This innovative dietary strategy may be more effective at reducing risk and ameliorating diet-related cardiometabolic disorders than conventional dietary advice in this population.

"Using Machine Learning Approaches to Examine Emotion-Related Brain Activity and Substance Use Among Adolescents Project Summary/Abstract  Substance use and substance use disorder are leading causes of death and disability worldwide. Importantly, most adults with substance use disorder begin using substances as adolescents, making adolescence an important period for the development of substance use disorder. Thus, it is critical to identify factors related to substance use among adolescents, consistent with NIDA objective 1.1. One factor linked to adolescent substance use is negative emotion processing. As adolescents undergo significant biological and psychosocial changes across development they may experience altered negative emotion processing that can lead to substance use if not appropriately regulated. Unfortunately, there is limited understanding in how neural level differences in negative emotion processing is related to substance use among adolescents. Moreover, extant neuroimaging research on negative emotion processing and substance use has employed univariate methods instead of multivariate methods. In contrast to univariate methods, multivariate methods are more sensitive in detecting patterns of neural activation across voxels and yield more generalizable and replicable findings overall. In addition, this research has employed standardized negative emotion paradigms, which have high experimental control, but may be less likely to reflect negative emotion processing as it occurs in the real world. To address these gaps in the literature, the proposed study will use multivariate machine learning approaches (i.e., multivoxel pattern analysis) to classify patterns of neural activation in a standardized negative emotion processing task and in a novel naturalistic negative emotion processing task that differentiate substance using adolescents from non-using adolescents, as well as predict substance use disorder risk factors. Additionally, the proposed study will use machine learning approaches to examine sex differences in emotion-related neural activation to these tasks in relation to substance use. This research will be conducted on a sample of 326 12-13 year old adolescents from Sponsor’s (Chaplin) competing renewal grant (RO1 DA033431-06A1). Knowledge from the proposed study will be used to identify emotion-related neurobiological markers of adolescent substance use. Ultimately, these markers can be used to target at-risk adolescents in need of substance use prevention and intervention efforts. The goals of the proposed study will be accomplished within a research training plan aimed at developing multidisciplinary expertise in affective neuroscience, particularly in multivariate machine learning methods, and developmental models of substance use. The training plan includes completion of relevant coursework, attendance at targeted workshops, individual mentorship by experts in the field of development and neuroscience, and scientific writing and presentation experience. Project Narrative  This project uses machine learning fMRI approaches to investigate patterns of neural activation during negative emotion processing to classify and predict adolescent substance use. The goal of this research is to identify emotion-related neurobiological markers of substance use.

"Using Machine Learning Methods to Predict Treatment Outcome for Anxious Youth PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Anxiety disorders in youth are highly prevalent [1] and impairing [2-4]. Left untreated, these disorders confer substantial additional risk for the development of a wide range of negative sequelae, including substance use [5], suicidal ideation and attempts [6], and additional mental health comorbidities [7]. Although several treatments have demonstrated efficacy for anxiety in youth, including individual cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT), family CBT (FCBT), medication (MED), and combination of CBT and medication (COMB) [8], a meaningful portion of youth are classified as non-responders after a full course of treatment [9]. The identification of baseline predictors and moderators of response is critical to improve treatment efficacy and reduce burden on families. Increased anxiety severity, comorbidity (behavioral problems, depression), and family psychopathology, along with older age, female gender and anxiety diagnosis, have been highlighted as potential predictors and moderators of outcome. However, studies have been underpowered and findings are inconsistent [10]. To date, all studies have taken a traditional analytic approach, which typically provides conservative estimates as a result of imposed explanatory constraints [11]. Machine Learning (ML) represents a promising complementary statistical technique to traditional analyses, given its focus on predictive fit rather than explanatory inference [12] and will facilitate identification of non-linear, complex patterns of predictors and moderators at the individual level [13, 14]. These methods have shown promise in identification of treatment outcome predictors in other medical [e.g., 15-18] and psychiatric samples [e.g., 19-22], but to date have not been implemented in a sample of anxious youth. The proposed project will aggregate datasets from at minimum ten peer-reviewed and published randomized controlled trials (N=1444) and train and validate two models along overlapping features, including (1) demographics, (2) diagnosis, (3) anxiety severity (4) behavioral problems, and (5) family psychopathology. Models will also be used to examine differential response to ICBT, FCBT, MED and COMB. Aggregated data will be uploaded into a centralized dataset, in line with the NIMH RDoC db and NDAR [23] datasets, and then used to predict outcome for individual anxious youth (N=80) completing ICBT and COMB at the Child and Adolescent Anxiety Disorders Clinic at Temple. The aims of this study are consistent with calls issued in the NIMH strategic plan (Objective 3) and will help facilitate the development of person-centered interventions for anxious youth [24]. An individualized approach to treatment is important to further increase treatment efficacy and reduce the financial and emotional burden associated with non-response [25, 26]. A training plan has been designed that consists of mentorship, formal classwork and experiential learning to develop the applicant's expertise in machine learning and dataset aggregation. The proposed study will take place within Temple University's clinical psychology program, which has a successful track record of conducting impactful NIMH-funded research and training research scientists. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although several efficacious treatments have been identified for youth anxiety, there is significant heterogeneity in treatment response and this heterogeneity is poorly understood. To help clarify differences in treatment response and facilitate the development of person-centered interventions, novel and advanced statistical approaches should be implemented using adequately powered datasets. The proposed study will (1) use machine-learning methods to identify predictors and moderators of outcome in an aggregated dataset of at minimum ten Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) examining youth anxiety treatments (individual and family cognitive behavioral therapy, medication, and combination treatments), (2) create a centralized dataset of aggregated RCTs to foster continued cross-site collaboration and (3) test the model's predictive accuracy at the individual level in a real-world sample.",Using Machine Learning Methods to Predict Treatment Outcome for Anxious Youth,9990935,F31MH123038,"['Aftercare ', ' After Care ', ' After-Treatment ', ' post treatment ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Anxiety ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Cognitive Therapy ', ' Cognition Therapy ', ' Cognitive Psychotherapy ', ' cognitive behavior intervention ', ' cognitive behavior modification ', ' cognitive behavior therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral intervention ', ' cognitive behavioral modification ', ' cognitive behavioral therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral treatment ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Data Aggregation ', ' Aggregated Data ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Effect Modifiers (Epidemiology) ', ' Conditional Variables ', ' Epidemiologic Effect Modifiers ', ' Moderator Variables ', ' Family ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Peer Review ', ' Clinical Psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Publishing ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Adolescent ', ' Training ', ' AOD use ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' using substances ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Cooperative Learning ', ' Experiential Learning ', ' Active Learning ', ' Funding ', ' behavioral problem ', ' Problem behavior ', ' Collaborations ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicide ideation ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Performance ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' parent role ', ' parental role ', ' Reporting ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Research Training ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Update ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' active technique ', ' active treatment ', ' active method ', ' pediatric anxiety ', ' youth anxiety ', ' childhood anxiety ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Impairment ', ' person centered ', ' comparative ', ' demographics ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' treatment response ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' RDoC ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' social anxiety ', ' Social Anxiety Disorder ', ' anxiety treatment ', ' anxious individuals ', ' anxious ', ' Personalized medical approach ', ' individualized approach ', ' precision approach ', ' tailored approach ', ' personalized approach ', ' individual patient ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' outcome prediction ', ' depressive model ', ' depression model ', ' individual heterogeneity ', ' individual variability ', ' individual variation ', ' Infrastructure ', ' machine learning method ', ' burden on families ', ' burden to families ', ' familial burden ', ' family burden ', ' ']",NIMH,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,F31,2020,33509,PA-02,0.06503988230852675
"ABCD-USA Consortium: Data Analysis, Informatics and Resource Center Project Summary/Abstract In its initial funding period, the ABCD consortium used a rigorous epidemiological approach to recruit a diverse sample of 11,878 9-10-year-olds through our 21 research sites, of which 2136 are twins or triplets. ABCD has created a comprehensive yet efficient protocol for participating youth and parents, using standardized and state-of-the-art methods for neuroimaging, biospecimens, and assessments of substance use, mental and physical health, neurocognition, culture, and environment, using a fully digital platform and making use of mobile technologies. We ensure cohesion and standardization by having employed a recruitment strategy designed by a professional survey company (experience with Monitoring the Future); standardized environmental, neurocognitive and mental health assessments, MRI assessments with all scanners using harmonized Human Connectome Project procedures, and computerized data collection with real-time quality control. Developmentally tailored assessments will have stable sensitivity and construct validity across the childhood and adolescent developmental period. They minimize participant burden, yet capture even subtle changes over time in substance use, mental health, neurocognition, development, and environment, and we employ novel state-of-the-art bioassays and passive data collection from mobile devices. A detailed retention plan builds on the experience and success of our investigators. This application describes the ABCD Data Analysis, Informatics and Resource Center (DAIRC), which will: maintain and update the harmonized MRI acquisition protocol, compatible with all major scanner platforms, taking advantage of recent technological advances in structural and functional MRI; perform rigorous quality control and quantitative calibration procedures to ensure accuracy and comparability of derived imaging measures across scanners and across time; implement advanced computational analysis workflows for all imaging data; implement reliable data entry, quality control, and monitoring tools for the substance use questionnaire, neurocognitive assessments, bioassay- derived measures, and mobile technologies assessment data; implement the state-of-the-art statistical analysis tools and procedures needed to integrate information across measures and modalities; continue development of infrastructure and procedures for public sharing of raw and derived data and associated tools and computational workflows; and enable interactive data exploration and analytics through a web-based Portal. PROJECT NARRATIVE The ABCD Consortium will use multimodal brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, mobile monitoring, and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning in 11,878 adolescents followed over 10 years to determine the effects of substance use on adolescent brain and cognitive development. Our ABCD Data Analysis, Informatics and Resource Center (DAIRC) will maintain and update harmonized MRI protocols across sites and scanners, perform quality control of raw and derived data, and implement the informatics and computational infrastructure needed for the overall project.","ABCD-USA Consortium: Data Analysis, Informatics and Resource Center",9981957,U24DA041123,"['Affect ', '

"A software product that empowers individuals affected by substance use disorders and their care teams with health and social resources Project Summary Access to community resources such as housing, food, transportation and medication also known as social determinants of health (SDOH) has been shown to be critical for a successful treatment and recovery of substance use disorders (SUD). Therefore, case managers and social workers at various points-of-care (e.g. law enforcement sobering centers, primary health centers) dedicate time to identify community resources that may address their patients’ health and social barriers. However, identifying competent community resources remains a challenge as they are usually stored in manual “referral binders” which are highly duplicated and fragmented across organizations. Therefore, this significantly contributes to lack of direct access to recovery capital for individuals affected by SUD. Based on preliminary data and interviews with case managers and social workers, this SBIR Phase I study has two objectives. 1) Evaluate whether a co-creation led business model that will leverage partnerships with organizations that have SUD subject matter expertise (e.g. Houston Recovery Center - https://houstonrecoverycenter.org/) can provide enhanced access to SUD treatment services and community resources at the point-of-care. This is important as most points-of-care particularly primary health centers may not have care teams highly experienced in curating SUD related resources. Therefore, our innovation will facilitate the flow of SUD related community resources from organizations with SUD subject matter expertise to those without, such as primary health centers. 2) Establish the feasibility of a novel computational natural language processing (NLP) algorithm in matching health and social needs identified at the point-of-care to relevant and competent community resources. Our hypothesis is that the co-creation led business model coupled with a novel computational natural language processing (NLP) algorithm will lead to enhanced access to appropriate SUD recovery and healthcare resources. Finally, upon successful completion of Phase I, a future Phase II project will focus on establishing whether these innovations have a positive impact on the utilization of SUD recovery support services, encounters with law enforcement and EMS services. Project Narrative Social factors such as housing, transportation and medication have a significant impact on substance use treatment and recovery outcomes. This Phase I proposal will establish a novel co-creation model that leverages local community partnerships to curate community resources. In addition, our novel software technology prototype will match patients’ health and social needs with resources at the point-of-care to improve the quality of care for patients with substance use disorders.",A software product that empowers individuals affected by substance use disorders and their care teams with health and social resources,9984913,R43DA051063,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Appointment ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Capital ', ' Client ', ' Communities ', ' Counseling ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Employment ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Health ', ' Health care facility ', ' Health Facilities ', ' Healthcare Facility ', ' care facilities ', ' Health Services ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Housing ', ' Interview ', ' Manuals ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Online Systems ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' online computer ', ' web based ', ' Patients ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Social Workers ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Engineering ', ' Computer Software Development ', ' Computer Software Engineering ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Transportation ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Businesses ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Caring ', ' Social Impacts ', ' Law Enforcement ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Distal ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' AOD use ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' using substances ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Licensing ', ' tool ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' System ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' peer ', ' Agreement ', ' outreach ', ' Care Manager ', ' Case Management Nurse ', ' Case Manager ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' point of care ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' Coupled ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' prototype ', ' commercialization ', ' high risk ', ' social health determinants ', ' Phase I Study ', ' phase 1 study ', ' application program interface ', ' application programming interface ', ' crowd source ', ' crowd-sourcing ', ' crowdsource ', ' crowdsourcing ', ' community partnership ', ' relapse risk ', ' opiate overdose ', ' opiate related overdose ', ' opioid drug overdose ', ' opioid induced overdose ', ' opioid intoxication ', ' opioid medication overdose ', ' opioid poisoning ', ' opioid related overdose ', ' opioid toxicity ', ' opioid overdose ', ' treatment services ', ' societal costs ', ' social factors ', ' ']",NIDA,"MEDICAL INNOVATORS COMPANY, LLC",R43,2020,224865,TX-07,-0.020776500167379357
"The Role of Social and Neural Connectedness in Predicting Neurodevelopmental Functioning in Adolescence PROJECT SUMMARY Few effective interventions exist for neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), which are associated with significant impairment, high rates of disability, and substantial public health costs. The prevalence of NDDs has increased considerably over the past two decades, and children with NDDs make up the largest proportion of youth that seek mental health treatment. Thus, novel approaches for understanding NDDs and identifying potential treatment targets for these disorders are needed. NDDs often have comorbid presentations and shared symptomatology (e.g., impaired social functioning), which suggests that using a transdiagnostic approach to study NDDs may be informative. This approach could reveal modifiable factors and underlying neurobiological mechanisms that could be targeted through intervention to reduce neurodevelopmental symptomatology. Social connectedness (i.e., extracurricular involvement, family dynamics, and relationships with peers and parents) may be a salient protective factor for youth with neurodevelopmental symptomatology. An important neural correlate for social functioning appears to be functional connectivity within the salience network (SN), which is involved in detection of relevant stimuli (e.g., changes in other's emotional expressions).Thus, social connectedness and related connectivity within the SN may be predictive of neurodevelopmental outcomes. The potential protective role of these factors may be particularly salient during adolescence, which is a vulnerable period for many of the negative outcomes associated with NDDs. The proposed longitudinal project will capitalize on the multi-level framework of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study by using psychosocial, functional neuroimaging, and cognitive data from two timepoints (i.e., baseline and one-year follow-up) to assess neurodevelopmental functioning in a sample of >11,500 youth in early adolescence. The project will be conducted at the Laureate Institute for Brain Research, which is an ABCD study site. The aims of the proposed project are threefold: to determine whether 1) social connectedness is associated with SN functional connectivity cross-sectionally; 2) social connectedness predicts future neurodevelopmental function; and 3) SN functional connectivity predicts future neurodevelopmental function. These aims will be assessed using linear mixed effects models with relevant covariates included (e.g., baseline neurodevelopmental function, youth ethnicity, youth gender, and family income). The proposed study has an exploratory aim of utilizing a data-driven, machine learning approach to identify additional modifiable factors (e.g., sleep, physical activity, screen time) that predict future neurodevelopmental function. The project is novel in that it takes a transdiagnostic approach to studying NDDs, it is longitudinal, and it has the potential for replication and extension as future data are released. Results from the project could have meaningful clinical relevance with the potential for identifying treatment targets for future interventions aiming to improve neurodevelopmental symptomatology in early adolescence. PROJECT NARRATIVE Because neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) are associated with significant impairment and public health costs and few psychological interventions are known to be effective for reducing neurodevelopmental symptomatology, identification of novel treatment targets for individuals with NDDs is needed. The present longitudinal study will address this need by utilizing a large, nationally-representative sample of youth (N = 11,500+; age 9-10) to examine the roles of social connectedness (i.e., extracurricular involvement, family dynamics, and relationships with peers and parents) and related neural connectedness (i.e., functional connectivity within the salience network) in predicting future neurodevelopmental functioning (indexed by both parent-reported symptoms and objective executive function tasks). Results from this study could therefore delineate modifiable social factors and underlying neural mechanisms that are protective against neurodevelopmental symptomatology in early adolescence and

"Using Machine Learning and Blockchain Technology to Reduce Drug Diversion in Hospitals Drug diversion, defined as “the transfer of a controlled substance from a lawful to an unlawful channel of distribution or use,” is a challenging issue in today's healthcare systems. Based on an analysis, the volume of dosage lost due to diversion increased from 21 million in 2017 to 47 million in 2018, a 126% increase. This resulted in over $450M loss to healthcare systems due to drug diversion, a 50% increase compared to 2017. Hospitals and medical centers constitute the single largest category affected by drug diversion accounting for 33% of all cases and 94% of drug diversion incidents involved opioids. Addressing the drug diversion problem is a multi-faceted problem involving many components ranging from provider training to implementation of hardware and software systems to manage access to controlled substances. However, despite recent improvements in controlling and monitoring access to controlled substances, the process of identifying drug diversion is complicated and time consuming. In this Phase I project, we propose to build on our earlier work in machine learning and automated technologies in healthcare and consensus in a distributed and decentralized architecture to develop a technology based on blockchains to track and document transportation and administration of controlled substances in a hospital environment. The proposed system involves using a smartphone app to scan uniquely generated barcodes for vials of controlled substances during the transport process, digitally sign medication transfers between staff using secure digital certificates to eliminate current paper-based systems, and finally document administration of a controlled substance to the patient by scanning the unique barcode assigned to the vial and recording an after administration picture of the empty vial. Specific Aims: 1) Developing and validating an in silico model of drug transport/diversion in the hospital; we will develop a stochastic model of controlled substance vial movement in the hospital between a series of locations at the hospital. The vials are exchanged between these locations by agents that represent clinical staff. 2) Developing a blockchain-based framework to track medications; we will use the Hyperledger Fabric, an open-source blockchain framework geared towards enterprise applications to design and implement a blockchain framework. We will develop a software interface to record data in and retrieve data from the blockchain (and in a potential Phase II, retrieve data from EMRs and automated dispensing cabinets) for further processing. Finally, we will use the in silico model to quantify the computational power and storage requirements for the blockchain framework discussed above; and 3) Development of an algorithm to identify diversion, the goal of this specific aim is to develop a computational engine that uses data (recorded in the blockchain) to detect drug diversion. We propose to use a framework based on machine learning to detect anomalies in data (i.e., drug diversion). !

"Predicting Substance Use and Related Antisocial Behavior with Psychiatric, Socioeconomic, and Brain Measures in Women Offenders Project Summary/Abstract Substance use costs society $740 billion dollars each year, placing an enormous burden on our nation’s health care and criminal justice systems. Approximately 85% of incarcerated offenders in the United States have a history of substance use and/or are imprisoned for crimes involving or motivated by alcohol and/or drug use. Incarcerated individuals tend to show poorer outcomes following substance use treatment, and forced abstinence via imprisonment is associated with risk for future substance use, which likely contributes to substance-related antisocial behavior following imprisonment. Over the past few decades, women have been sentenced to prison for drug-related reasons at alarming rates, with a growth rate exceeding that for men. Further, women offenders tend to be impacted more heavily by substance use with co-morbid psychopathology, placing greater demands on the system in terms of substance use and mental health treatments. Using the world’s largest forensic neuroimaging database on women offenders (SWANC-F), this proposal investigates substance use and related antisocial behavior following release from prison in a large sample of women offenders, with a focus on neurobiological mechanisms, to demonstrate the utility of brain measures in estimating long-term substance use outcomes in at-risk women. Substance-related antisocial behavior, defined as committing crime(s) related to substance use after release from prison, will be obtained from re-arrest data in institutional files and comprehensive background checks on all women enrolled in the study. A random sample (n = 100) will then be followed-up with via phone to gather data on substance use and obtain supplemental information to corroborate re-arrest data from files and background checks. Employing regression analyses and machine learning/pattern classifier approaches, models will be compared testing effects of psychiatric and socioeconomic variables, along with resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) brain measures, to examine unique and combined effects in differentiating among heterogeneous etiological mechanisms driving substance use outcomes of interest in women. Specifically, this proposal seeks to test the extent to which psychiatric and socioeconomic factors confer risk for substance-related antisocial behavior following release from prison in women (Aim 1), and integrates and compares the utility of rsFC brain measures in improving these prediction models (Aim 2). Then, similar methods will be applied to test the prediction of substance use following release from prison (Aim 3). It is expected that psychiatric risk factors and socioeconomic protective factors, as well as rsFC brain measures, will be useful in predicting substance use and related antisocial behavior following incarceration, along with time elapsed between release from prison and initiation of substance use and related behavior. Testing factors that aid in predicting these behaviors in women has the potential to be far-reaching by informing the development of targeted treatments, including those that help to account for sex differences and co-morbid conditions related to substance use. Project Narrative Women represent one of the fastest growing segments of substance users in the United States, with a growth rate of substance-related offending exceeding that of men; however, women continue to be one of the most underserved populations in substance use research. This proposal will compare statistical models testing effects of psychiatric and socioeconomic factors, along with resting-state functional connectivity in and between cognitive control, decision-making, and reward-processing neural circuitry, to examine unique and combined effects in differentiating among heterogeneous etiological mechanisms driving substance use outcomes in women. The primary goal of this proposal is to examine the utility of brain measures in estimating long-term substance use outcomes in at-risk women in an effort to help inform future treatment efforts.","Predicting Substance Use and Related Antisocial Behavior with Psychiatric, Socioeconomic, and Brain Measures in Women Offenders",10001326,F31DA047048,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' EtOH use ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol use ', ' Anxiety ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Crime ', ' Decision Making ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Economics ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Employment ', ' Fibrinogen ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor I ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor One ', ' Blood Factor One ', ' Coagulation Factor I ', ' Coagulation Factor One ', ' Factor I ', ' Factor One ', ' Forensic Medicine ', ' Forensics ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Insula of Reil ', ' Central Lobe ', ' Insula ', ' Island of Reil ', ' Marital Status ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Moods ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Odds Ratio ', ' Cross-Product Ratio ', ' Relative Odds ', ' Risk Ratio ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Personality ', ' Play ', ' Prisons ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Regression Analysis ', ' Regression Analyses ', ' Regression Diagnostics ', ' Statistical Regression ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Societies ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Technology ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Criminal Justice ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Anterior ', ' Clinical ', ' incarcerated ', ' incarceration ', ' Imprisonment ', ' Biological ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' AOD use ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' using substances ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Data Files ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Logistics ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Sample Size ', ' Funding ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' Performance ', ' hazard ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' criminal offender ', ' offender ', ' social ', ' antisocial ', ' anti social ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Brain region ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' adolescent trauma ', ' childhood trauma ', ' trauma in children ', ' pediatric trauma ', ' cost ', ' psychopathy ', ' psychopathic personality ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' under served population ', ' underserved people ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Abstinence ', ' data structure ', ' reward processing ', ' cognitive control ', ' neurobiological mechanism ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' anxious symptom ', ' anxiety symptoms ', ' antisocial behavior ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' outcome prediction ', ' protective factors ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' Differences between sexes ', ' Differs between sexes ', ' Sexual differences ', ' sex-dependent differences ', ' sex-related differences ', ' sex-specific differences ', ' Sex Differences ', ' structured data ', ' feature selection ', ' support vector machine ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO,F31,2020,36051,NM-01,0.06896177456543515
"Externalizing outcomes in high risk youth Project Summary/abstract Public attention has often been drawn to the relationship between violence and mental health issues, but violent behavior is a very complex phenomenon undergirded by myriad social, psychological, environmental, and biological influences. This project intends to investigate these influences among a large sample of previously incarcerated youth, following up with them and collecting valuable longitudinal data. Our team worked with these youth and their families collecting detailed psychological, behavioral, and neuroimaging measures as part of a previous NIH-funded investigation. The current project aims to re-assess these individuals (now young adults) to examine long-range positive (i.e., desistance from drug use/antisocial behavior) and negative (relapse to drugs, antisocial behavior) outcomes. We will collect new neuroimaging scans, which combined with prior MRI data, will be useful for quantifying trajectories of change that map to persistence and desistence from externalizing outcomes. Advanced machine-learning approaches will be utilized in conjunction with structural, functional, network, and dynamic network brain measures in addition to behavioral and psychological measures. Machine learning approaches are capable of identifying patterns in high-dimensional data and delineating the unique combinations of variables that are most predictive of specific outcome variables. Using these methods, we intend to define neural mechanisms that predict outcomes. We also aim to identify combinations of variables that confer greater risk for persistent antisocial behavior and violence. The translational value of this work will be to clarify informative patterns of data that may indicate preventable outcomes. Furthermore, neural measures indicative of specific vulnerability will be identified as specific targets for treatment and novel intervention strategies. By identifying specific vulnerabilities and the changes that accompany positive outcomes, we will be closer to understanding the best way to recognize and prevent costly violent behavior. Project Narrative Recent attention has been drawn to the relationship between mental health issues and potentially preventable forms of violence, antisocial behavior, and substance abuse. This project aims to investigate neural, psychological, and life-course variables that may help predict divergent trajectories for persistent antisocial behavior and desistance by applying advanced statistical models in conjunction with longitudinal data from a unique sample of antisocial youth. Identifying variables that predict these outcomes will further help us to develop more efficacious treatment and intervention strategies.",Externalizing outcomes in high risk youth,9709107,R01HD092331,"['Forensic Medicine ', ' Forensics ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' indexing ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Life Cycle ', ' life course ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Maps ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Neuropsychological Tests ', ' Neuropsychologic Tests ', ' New Mexico ', ' Psychological Factors ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Sociology ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Violence ', ' violent ', ' violent behavior ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' brain visualization ', ' Brain imaging ', ' Lateral ', ' Anterior ', ' Medial ', ' Area ', ' incarcerated ', ' incarceration ', ' Imprisonment ', ' Biological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Adolescent ', ' Age of Onset ', ' Evaluation ', ' Discipline ', ' AOD use ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' using substances ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' young adult ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Scanning ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' psychosocial ', ' cohort ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Neural Development ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' developmental psychology ', ' habitual offender ', ' multiple offender ', ' repeat offender ', ' social ', ' abuse of substances ', ' substance abuse ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' antisocial ', ' anti social ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' MRI Scans ', ' correctional system ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Academia ', ' Consent ', ' Data ', ' Sum ', ' Collection ', ' Security ', ' Pathologic ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' callous unemotional trait ', ' adolescent trauma ', ' childhood trauma ', ' trauma in children ', ' pediatric trauma ', ' cost ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' convict ', ' externalizing behavior ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' neural mechanism ', ' neuromechanism ', ' cognitive neuroscience ', ' Impairment ', ' cognitive control ', ' high risk ', ' treatment strategy ', ' behavior outcome ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' antisocial behavior ', ' trait impulsivity ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' outcome prediction ', ' high dimensionality ', ' protective factors ', ' multi-modal data ', ' multi-modal datasets ', ' multimodal datasets ', ' multimodal data ', ' high dimensional data ', ' multidimensional datasets ', ' multidimensional data ', ' social factors ', ' structured data ', ' Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Aggressive behavior ', ' Aggression ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Crime ', ' Criminology ', ' Dangerousness ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Expenditure ', ' Family ', ' Firearms ', ' Follow-Up Studies ', ' Followup Studies ', ' ']",NICHD,THE MIND RESEARCH NETWORK,R01,2020,706182,NM-01,0.005551441713504218
"Testing Scalable, Single-Session Interventions for Adolescent Depression in the context of COVID-19 Project Summary/Abstract States and localities nationwide are taking unprecedented steps to reduce public health threats posed by COVID-19, including school closures affecting >50 million youth. The pandemic has also caused families extreme financial hardship, sudden unemployment, and distress. This combination of collective trauma, social isolation, and economic recession drastically increases risk for adolescent major depression (MD): already the lead cause of disability in youth. However, youth MD treatments face problems of potency and accessibility. Up to 65% of youth receiving MD treatment fail to respond, partly due to MD’s heterogeneity: an MD diagnosis reflects >1400 possible symptom combinations, highlighting the need for treatments matched to personal need. Treatment accessibility issues are similarly severe. Before the pandemic, <50% of youth with MD accessed any treatment at all; newfound financial strain will further preclude families’ capacity to afford care for their children. It is thus critical to identify effective, scalable strategies to buffer against youth MD in the context of COVID-19, along with strategies to match such interventions with youth most likely to benefit. This project will integrate machine learning approaches and large-scale SSI research to rapidly test potent, accessible strategies for reducing adolescent MD during COVID-19. Via the largest-ever SSI trial (N=1,200 youth with elevated MD symptoms, ages 12-16), Aim 1 is to test whether (1) evidence-based SSIs improve proximal targets (e.g., hopelessness and perceived agency, which has predicted longer-term SSI response) and 3- month clinical outcomes (MD severity) during the COVID-19 pandemic, and (2) whether SSIs targeting cognitive versus behavioral MD symptoms are most impactful in this context. In a fully-online trial, youths recruited from across the U.S. will be randomized to 1 of 3 self-administered SSIs: a behavioral activation SSI, targeting behavioral MD symptoms (anhedonia; activity withdrawal); an SSI teaching growth mindset, the belief that personal traits are malleable, targeting cognitive MD symptoms (e.g. hopelessness); or a control SSI. Per baseline, post-SSI, and 3-month follow-up data, we will test each SSI’s relative benefits, versus the control, in the context of COVID-19. Results will reveal whether SSIs targeting behavioral versus cognitive symptoms differentially reduce overall MD severity in this context. Aim 2 is to test whether (and, if so, which of) SSIs can impact COVID-19 specific trauma and anxiety symptoms, informing whether novel, COVID-19-tailored supports may be needed to reduce pandemic-specific mental health sequelae. Aim 3 is to test person-level and contextual predictors of SSI response, via machine-learning techniques, regardless of overall intervention effects observed. Given MD’s heterogeneity, we will test whether baseline symptoms (e.g., having more severe cognitive or behavioral MD symptoms) predict response to SSIs targeting different symptom types. We will also test exposure to COVID-19-related adversities (e.g. parent job loss; loved one hospitalized for COVID-19) and general disadvantage (e.g. family low-income; racial minority status) forecast SSI response. Project Narrative The goal of this project is to integrate machine learning approaches and large-scale single-session intervention (SSI) research to rapidly test potent, accessible strategies for reducing depression in adolescents in the context of COVID-19. Via the largest-ever SSI trial (N=1200 adolescents), goals are to test whether evidence- based SSIs improve proximal targets (hopelessness, perceived agency, anhedonia) and clinical outcomes 3 months later (depression symptoms and COVID-19-related anxiety and trauma) in adolescents experiencing depression; whether SSIs targeting cognitive versus behavioral depression symptoms produce more favorable outcomes, versus an active control; and whether individual profiles of symptoms or COVID-19-related adversity exposure predicts individual-level SSI response. Results may identify novel, immediately actionable strategies to matching adolescents to targeted SSIs based on personal needs during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Testing Scalable, Single-Session Interventions for Adolescent Depression in the context of COVID-19",10164526,DP5OD028123,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Anxiety ', ' Belief ', ' Buffers ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Dropout ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Persons ', ' Occupations ', ' Jobs ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Online Systems ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' online computer ', ' web based ', ' Parents ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Schools ', ' Self Administration ', ' Self-Administered ', ' Social isolation ', ' Students ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Testing ', ' Unemployment ', ' jobless ', ' joblessness ', ' out of work ', ' unemployed ', ' Work ', ' Economic Recession ', ' Generations ', ' falls ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Cannot see a future ', ' Feels there is no future ', ' Loss of hope for the future ', ' Negative about the future ', ' No hope for the future ', ' hopelessness ', ' Feeling hopeless ', ' Caring ', ' Anhedonia ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' prematurity ', ' premature ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' disability ', ' Distress ', ' Individual ', ' Withdrawal ', ' Logistics ', ' Exposure to ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Severities ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' Cognitive Manifestations ', ' Cognitive Symptoms ', ' Neurobehavioral Signs and Symptoms ', ' neurobehavioral symptom ', ' Neurobehavioral Manifestations ', ' psychosocial ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' trait ', ' novel ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Interventional trial ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' clinical depression ', ' major depression ', ' major depression disorder ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Length ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Cognitive ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' Behavioral ', ' pandemic ', ' pandemic disease ', ' active control ', ' treatment trial ', ' virtual ', ' adolescent depression ', ' adolescents with depression ', ' childhood depression ', ' childhood onset depression ', ' depressed adolescents ', ' depression in adolescence ', ' pediatric depression ', ' youth depression ', ' child depression ', ' Outcome ', ' Trauma ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy design ', ' high risk ', ' loved ones ', ' evidence base ', ' intervention effect ', ' anxious symptom ', ' anxiety symptoms ', ' social media ', ' prediction of response ', ' predictive response ', ' predictor of response ', ' response prediction ', ' predicting response ', ' racial minority ', ' trauma symptom ', ' lower income families ', ' recruit ', ' financial burden ', ' financial distress ', ' financial strain ', ' financial stress ', ' Financial Hardship ', ' COVID19 ', ' corona virus disease 2019 ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 ', ' COVID-19 ', ' COVID-19 epidemic ', ' COVID19 epidemic ', ' COVID19 pandemic ', ' corona virus disease 2019 epidemic ', ' corona virus disease 2019 pandemic ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic ', ' COVID-19 pandemic ', ' ']",OD,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,DP5,2020,392813,NY-01,0.10599676942906928

"Novel Accelerometer Calibration and Validation in Children andAdolescents Summary Accelerometers have been embraced by the scientific community as valid and reliable physical activity (PA) assessment tools. This is especially true in some sub-populations, such as children, who lack the ability to self- report their behaviors. Tremendous progress has been made in the objective assessment of PA and sedentary behavior (SB). Several measurement challenges remain that limit our ability to identify; dose-response associations with disease and risk factors, prevalence and determinants of these important health behaviors, changes in behavior due to time and intervention efforts. To overcome these challenges, we propose novel calibration procedures that will leverage the richness of three axes of raw acceleration data during free-living calibration activities, from wrist- and hip-worn accelerometers. Consistent with current PA recommendations for youth, the proposed study will focus on calibrating and validating accelerometer output to quantify intensity and duration of PA and identifying specific predominant modes of activity (e.g., sedentary time, locomotion, and fine/gross motor activity). Our primary goal is to follow best-practices data collection and analysis procedures to develop a comprehensive set of accelerometer algorithms that will accurately and precisely estimate minutes of various intensities of PA and mode of activity from hip- and wrist-worn accelerometers in children and adolescents (18 months to 21 years old), using video recorded direct observation during free-living activities as the criterion measure. Narrative Accurate and precise estimates of physical activity, sedentary behavior, and patterns of those behaviors in youth are essential in order to identify changes in those behaviors and to inform related policy decisions. The proposed research will extend previous accelerometer calibration studies by videotaping free-living activities in a large sample across a wide age range of children and adolescents. The raw acceleration signals from both hip- and wrist-worn devices will be analyzed using linear regression and machine learning methods to generate a family of freely available algorithms that produce accurate and precise estimates, reducing inconsistencies and confusion on use of previous accelerometer cutpoints in youth.",Novel Accelerometer Calibration and Validation in Children andAdolescents,9938564,R01DK110148,"['Acceleration ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Behavior ', ' Calibration ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communities ', ' Confusion ', ' Confusional State ', ' Mental Confusion ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Collection ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Controlled Environment ', ' artificial environment ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Hip region structure ', ' Coxa ', ' Hip ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Linear Regressions ', ' Locomotion ', ' Methods ', ' Motor Activity ', ' Locomotor Activity ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Time ', ' Videotape ', ' Work ', ' Wrist ', ' Measures ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' sedentary ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Adolescent ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Physical assessment ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Frequencies ', ' Pattern ', ' behavior change ', ' age group ', ' novel ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Devices ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' actigraph ', ' actigraphy ', ' data processing ', ' computerized data processing ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Output ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' 21 years of age ', ' age 21 ', ' age 21 years ', ' twenty-one year old ', ' twenty-one years of age ', ' 21 year old ', ' Health behavior change ', ' Sedentary behavior ', ' Sedentary life-style ', ' sedentary lifestyle ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' Assessment tool ', ' accelerometry ', ' activity monitor ', ' activity tracker ', ' Accelerometer ', ' Long-term cohort study ', ' Longterm cohort study ', ' Longitudinal cohort study ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST,R01,2020,355478,MA-02,0.03924871945760064
"Connectome-based neuromarkers of problem cannabis use Project Summary/Abstract  Insufficient knowledge of brain-based risk factors for problem cannabis use is a key barrier to identifying individuals at risk for cannabis-related harm and designing targeted prevention and early intervention approaches to promote positive development for persons at risk. The current proposal combines multiple, large- scale, neuroimaging datasets with novel densely-sampled fMRI data to identify a neuromarker of problem cannabis use and characterize its development prior to cannabis use onset, and in the context of current cannabis use in adolescence. We will apply a whole-brain, machine-learning method – connectome-based predictive modeling – to identify a neural network predictive of problem cannabis use in a large sample of college students (Brain and Alcohol Research in College Students study; BARCS), and compare this network to canonical neural networks previously implicated in risk for cannabis use: frontoparietal, salience, and default mode networks. We will then examine the developmental trajectory of these cannabis risk networks in relation to other known risk factors for addiction prior to cannabis use onset in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) dataset, a nationally-representative sample of 11,875 children. We will examine whether individuals at high-risk for substance use problems (family history of substance use and exposure to early adversity) display a delay in the typical trajectory of network stabilization within cannabis risk networks. Finally, we will collect densely-sampled fMRI data (4 scans in 6 months) from 20 adolescents (age 15-17) who regularly use cannabis and 20 age- and sex-matched typically-developing adolescents. This study design will enable us to examine cannabis effects on short-term neural network dynamics and evaluate whether cannabis using adolescents are characterized by reduced stability of cannabis risk networks relative to their typically-developing peers. By combining multiple existing large-scale neuroimaging datasets with original, longitudinal, densely- sampled fMRI data, the proposed study design offers a unique opportunity to examine the interplay between neural mechanisms of risk for problem use and cannabis exposure effects on the developing adolescent brain and promises to yield important insights into the neural mechanisms of risk for problem cannabis use that can foster novel prevention and intervention initiatives to mitigate cannabis-related harms for individuals at high risk.  The current proposal also aims to provide Dr. Sarah Lichenstein with expert mentorship by Drs. Pearlson, Casey, Yip, Scheinost and Stevens to build the skills necessary to develop into an independent clinical scientist applying multimodal neuroimaging methods to study the pathophysiology of addiction. Dr. Lichenstein will pursue specialized training in studying cannabis effects on brain and behavior, big data science, and the conduct of research with adolescent participants. Furthermore, the collection of novel, densely-sampled, adolescent fMRI data will also provide Dr. Lichenstein with a rich and unique pilot dataset to support the submission of a R01 application by the end of the award period and facilitate her transition to an independent investigator. Project Narrative Cannabis use is extremely common and associated with clinically-significant negative outcomes for a subset of users, yet it is not currently possible to predict who is at highest risk for cannabis-related harms at the individual level. The current proposal aims to identify a neural network predictive of problem cannabis use, and to characterize the development of this network both before and after cannabis use onset. Elucidating the neural basis of problem cannabis use will facilitate the development of novel prevention and early intervention efforts to mitigate potential cannabis-related harms for individuals at highest risk.",Connectome-based neuromarkers of problem cannabis use,10038977,K08DA051667,"['Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Award ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Striatum ', ' striatal ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Exhibits ', ' Family ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Literature ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Specificity ', ' Students ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Adolescent ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' AOD use ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' using substances ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Family Medical History ', ' Family Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Family history of ', ' Fostering ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Exposure to ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Scanning ', ' Pattern ', ' college student ', ' university student ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Neural Development ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' skills ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' Sampling ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' MRI Scans ', ' Cannabis ', ' Base of the Brain ', ' Data ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Collection ', ' Risk Marker ', ' Validation ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Individual Differences ', ' neural mechanism ', ' neuromechanism ', ' 18 years of age ', ' age 18 years ', ' eighteen year old ', ' eighteen years of age ', ' 18 year old ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinically significant ', ' brain behavior ', ' alcohol related research ', ' ethanol research ', ' alcohol research ', ' brain research ', ' addictive disorder ', ' addiction ', ' eCB system ', ' endocannabinoid system ', ' endogenous cannabinoid system ', ' neurobiological mechanism ', ' high risk ', ' multi-modality ', ' multimodality ', ' cannabis legalization ', ' legal marijuana ', ' legalized cannabis ', ' legalized marijuana ', ' marijuana legalization ', ' cognitive development ', ' THC co-use ', ' THC use ', ' Tetrahydrocannabinol co-use ', ' Tetrahydrocannabinol use ', ' cannabis use ', ' marijuana use ', ' connectome ', ' illicit drug use ', ' early adversity ', ' early childhood adversity ', ' early life adversity ', ' neural network ', ' connectome based predictive modeling ', ' big-data science ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NIDA,YALE UNIVERSITY,K08,2020,191700,CT-03,0.05251420065372117
"Acute predictors of long-term post-trauma outcomes in youth victims of violence Youth violence victimization is common and increases risk for a host of negative health outcomes, most notably posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which is the strongest predictor of poor quality of life following trauma, even among those injured during the event. Given the potential harmful sequelae of trauma exposure, it is crucial to identify acute post-victimization risk factors that predict chronic PTSD. At this juncture relatively little data exists to aid in prediction of youth at risk for poor long-term adjustment following victimization or other types of trauma, and there are no studies measuring relevant neural systems. Thus, our team aims to 1) characterize acute post-victimization neurobehavioral predictors of risk for chronic PTSD with a focus on prefrontal-subcortical function during processing of threat processing and frontoparietal networks for cognitive control, and 2) use machine learning to identify the most robust set of predictors of chronic PTSD drawn from a comprehensive assessment of youth neuroimaging, behavior and self-report, parent and family factors, and neighborhood and community variables. Our team is well-prepared to successfully achieve these aims, as we have relevant expertise in conducting prospective longitudinal assessment of acute neurobehavioral predictors of risk for PTSD in adults (Larson), conducting longitudinal assessment of youth victims of violence (Levas), and longitudinally characterizing neurobehavioral profiles of youth PTSD (Herringa). We will recruit youth victims of violence aged 10-16 from the Emergency Department at Children’s Hospital of Wisconsin in Milwaukee, and conduct comprehensive assessments at 2 weeks, 3 months, and 12 months following victimization. To achieve a final sample of 200 youth at 12 month follow-up, we will recruit 240 youth, oversampled for risk for PTSD based on currently available brief self-report indicators. Each assessment will include measures of neural systems instantiating threat processing, including both reactivity to threat and anticipation of unpredictable and predictable threat, and cognitive control, along with measures of PTSD and other symptoms, cognitive functioning, family environment, social and school functioning, and socioenvironmental factors (e.g. neighborhood disadvantage, discrimination). We will examine how acute post- victimization variables (2 week) and early change following victimization (from 2 weeks to 3 months) predict PTSD and other outcomes twelve months later. We will use both hypothesis-driven analyses focusing on a priori specified regions and predictors, as well as comprehensive data-driven machine learning analyses. The comprehensive assessment will allow for determination of the additional utility of neural markers for predicting risk beyond previously identified self-report indicators. We expect this project to lead to identification of predictors of risk for PTSD following victimization that are linked to underlying processes (hyper-responsivity to threat, aberrant cognitive control) that can directly inform preventive interventions, ultimately improving the quality of life for youth victims of violence. PROJECT NARRATIVE Identifying youth victims of violence most at risk for long-term post-traumatic distress is a pressing public health problem. This work seeks to identify dysregulation in neural circuitry supporting cognitive and affective processes two weeks after victimization predicts PTSD and other post-trauma symptom twelve months later. These data will advance our understanding of neurobiological factors associated with vulnerability to specific trauma-related pathology and provide an important step toward identifying appropriate early interventions in the wake of violence victimization.",Acute predictors of long-term post-trauma outcomes in youth victims of violence,9941466,R01MH124076,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult

"From Manic Symptoms to Bipolar Disorder: Neural-behavioral Markers Using Two Analytic Models PROJECT SUMMARY Bipolar disorder (BD) is a devastating neuropsychiatric illness that affects 2-5% of youth and causes morbidity, functional impairment, and suicide. Prodromal manic symptoms without manic episodes usually emerge before BD types I and II (BD-I/II) develop, but less than 60% of youth with manic symptoms will develop BD-I/II. The uncertainty of diagnosis and illness progression results in potentially detrimental interventions and 7-10 years delay appropriate treatments. It is thus imperative that objective biomarkers of risk for conversion to BD-I/II are identified and tested in youth before the peak onset of illness. Given that neural measures of structure and function associated with emotion and reward processing, in combination with clinical and behavior measures, can improve prediction of psychiatric outcomes in youth, this project will investigate brain-behavior relations in the most severely ill youth during inpatient stays and aims to build a predictive model of BD. We aim to use two distinct analytic models to test our hypotheses. First a general linear model (GLM) with a machine learning (ML) model of regularized regression with cross validation and second a whole brain ML pattern recognition model. We will first identify neural and behavioral markers of BD-I/II in circuitry associated with emotion and reward processing. We hypothesize that decreased activity and connectivity in prefrontal, amygdala, and striatal regions and behavioral measures showing less sleep, lower activity, and poorer mood and cognition will distinguish BD- I/II from clinically matched youth without mania and healthy. Next, we will identify using ML a whole brain neural classifier of BD-I/II relative to clinically matched inpatients without mania. Aim 2 is to, after two years, identify and quantify the neural and behavioral measures that predict conversion to BD-I/II, and to test individual conversion in an independent group of high symptomatic risk adolescents. Aim 3 is to identify brain-behavior associations for app development. Training samples include mid-/post- pubertal adolescents aged 13-17 years recruited from the nation’s only specialized inpatient unit for adolescents with BD and the general adolescent unit at our hospital; 70 well-characterized adolescents with BD-I/II, a clinically matched group of 70 inpatient youth without mania. Testing sample is an independent group of 180 adolescents with manic symptoms without BD-I/II. 60 healthy controls will be recruited. The project includes emotion and reward processing neural function and structure, clinical and behavioral measures including sleep and activity with actigraphy, computerized cognitive measures, and self-reports during inpatient evaluation and for two weeks post discharge. At two-year follow up, clinical assessments will confirm diagnoses. This is the first study to employ a multimodal assessment of behavior and mood symptoms combined with multimodal imaging methods to comprehensively assess disease-specific abnormalities and prediction of BD-I/II. Findings from this study may identify biological and behavioral markers of conversion to BD-I/II in adolescents and may contribute developing disease-specific risk calculators, low-cost biosensors for mobile applications, and novel targets of intervention. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adolescents may experience manic symptoms that may or may not progress into bipolar disorder. This proposed longitudinal study would be the first of its kind and could shed light on the neural and behavioral markers of disease progression in high-risk adolescents with manic symptoms.

"PAGES: Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site Project Summary Physical activity (PA) prevents or ameliorates a large number of diseases, and inactivity is the 4th leading global mortality risk factor. The molecular mechanisms responsible for the diverse benefits of PA are not well understood. The Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) is being formed to advance knowledge in this area. We propose to establish PAGES, a Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site as an integral component of the MoTrPAC. PAGES will conduct comprehensive analyses of the rat and human PA intervention MoTrPAC samples, contribute these data to public databases, help identify candidate molecular transducers of PA and elucidate new PA response mechanisms, and help develop predictive models of the individual response to PA. PAGES assay sites at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York Genome Center and Broad Institute provide the infrastructure, expertise and experience to support this large scale, comprehensive analysis of molecular changes associated with PA. PAGES aims are to 1. Work with the MoTrPAC Steering Committee in Year 1 to finalize plans and protocols; 2. Perform assays and analyses to help Identify candidate molecular transducers of the response to PA in rat models and the pathways responsible for model differences, including high-depth RNA-seq and Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS), supplemented by additional assay types such as ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq based on initial results; 3. Perform comprehensive assays and analyses of the human MoTrPAC clinical study tissue samples, including RNA-seq, WGBS, H3K27ac ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq and whole genome sequencing. 4. Collaborate with the MoTrPAC to analyze data from PAGES and other MoTrPAC analysis sites to identify candidate PA transducers and molecular mechanisms, and to develop predictive models of PA capacity and response to training. The success of PAGES and the MoTrPAC program will transform insight into the molecular networks that transduce PA into health, create an unparalleled comprehensive public PA data resource, and can provide the foundation for profound advances in the prevention and treatment of many major human diseases. Project Narrative While physical activity prevents or improves a large number of diseases, the chemical changes that occur in the body and lead to better health are not well known. As a part of a consortium of physical activity research programs working together, we will use cutting-edge approaches to comprehensively study the changes in genes and gene products caused by physical activity.

"Neural Mechanisms of Irritability: A Dimensional Approach with Integration of Multi-Voxel Pattern Analysis and Univariate Analysis Chronic, clinically-impairing irritability is a serious health problem that affects 3-5% of youth and predicts both adult depressive and anxiety disorders and long-term impairment. Current studies on the neural mechanisms of irritability in youth employ traditional univariate analyses and have limitations: (1) they examine activation patterns in particular regions, thus using only a small portion of the data and (2) they tend to find small to moderate effect sizes. In addition, little is known about functional connectivity at rest and its association with irritability or the ability of neural measures to predict changes in irritability over time. These limitations could be addressed through research using multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA), i.e., by applying machine learning methods to both resting state and task-based fMRI data. MVPA exploits the full spatial pattern of brain activity and thus has increased sensitivity compared to conventional univariate, individual-voxel-based general linear model (GLM) approaches. However, univariate analyses may provide complementary or unique information relative to MVPA, given its sensitivity to variability and global engagement of task effects between subjects. The specific aims of this project are to identify patterns of whole-brain activation (Aim 1 & 2a, 2b) and functional connectivity at rest (Aim 2a, 2b) using a combination of MVPA and univariate approaches to predict (1) individual differences in irritability in a clinical sample of youth and in healthy youth with varying degrees of irritability, and (2a) individual differences in irritability and (2b) changes in irritability 6 months later in a community sample of youth with varying degrees of irritability. This work will provide new insights into the pathophysiology of multiple mental disorders for which irritability is an important symptom, and it has the potential to identify biomarkers that can be used to predict the course and prognosis of clinically-impairing irritability. The long-term goal of the PI is to become an independent NIH-funded investigator with a neuroscience-focused research program targeting developmental trajectories of irritability. To achieve this goal, the PI aims to expand her previous training to support both advanced, independent research on resting state and task-based fMRI and the use of pattern classification techniques, as well as their integration with univariate methods, applied in samples with varying degrees of irritability. This training objective directly supports the PI’s research objective, which is to identify the neural mechanisms of irritability and neural correlates that predict changes in irritability over time using a combination of MVPA and univariate imaging methods applied to task-based and resting state fMRI data. The central hypothesis, based on the PI’s pilot data, is that activity patterns during a frustration task, along with connectivity patterns at rest, will predict levels of, and changes in, irritability. Both univariate and MVPA approaches will converge on similar findings; however, MVPA will identify additional activation and connectivity patterns predictive of irritability or changes in irritability. The training objectives for this award are to enhance the PI’s research and professional skills and knowledge in three areas: (1) phenotyping clinically-impairing irritability; (2) task-based and resting state fMRI methods, designs, preprocessing, and advanced MVPA techniques, i.e., machine learning for analyzing fMRI data, and their integration with univariate analyses; and (3) professional skills essential for a successful research career as a faculty member at a research university. By completing the proposed research and training, the PI expects to obtain sufficient training to function as an independent developmental affective neuroscientist, and sufficient pilot data to submit a competitive R01 application designed to examine predictors of developmental changes in pediatric irritability across multiple levels of analysis from neural circuits, behaviors, social experiences, to environmental factors. The proposed project is relevant to public health because impairing irritability affects approximately 2.5 million youth in the U.S., and is a relatively common source of concern for clinicians, parents, and teachers. Clinicallyimpairing irritability in youth has been linked to adult psychopathology and is among the strongest predictors of suicidality across the life span. A better understanding of the neural markers underlying irritability and changes in irritability has significant potential to inform a better diagnostic classification system and to provide biomarkers for making treatment decisions, monitoring treatment responses, and predicting the developmental course of irritability.",Neural Mechanisms of Irritability: A Dimensional Approach with Integration of Multi-Voxel Pattern Analysis and Univariate Analysis,9994388,R00MH110570,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Attention ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Biological Sciences ', ' Biologic Sciences ', ' Bioscience ', ' Life Sciences ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Child Psychiatry ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communities ', ' Depressive disorder ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Faculty ', ' Feedback ', ' Frustration ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Linear Models ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Methods ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Parents ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prognosis ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Public Health ', ' Reproducibility of Results ', ' Reproducibility of Findings ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Rest ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Inferior Frontal Convolution ', ' Inferior frontal gyrus ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' teacher ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Sample Size ', ' Funding ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Parietal ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Categories ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Research Training ', ' Monitor ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' clinical phenotype ', ' time use ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' neural dysfunction ', ' Neuronal Dysfunction ', ' Individual Differences ', ' neural mechanism ', ' neuromechanism ', ' Impairment ', ' Affective ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' treatment response ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' RDoC ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' precision medicine ', ' neural correlate ', ' Developmental Course ', ' Individualized Predictors ', ' individualized predictions ', ' personalized predictors ', ' personalized predictions ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,R00,2020,242813,CT-03,0.05573226204276842
"Refinement of a rapid saliva miRNA diagnostic test for concussion Summary/Abstract - Quadrant Biosciences is developing a new diagnostic to aid in the clinical detection of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) in school-aged children and young adults (13–22 years). Based on salivary microRNA (miRNA) biomarkers, Quadrant’s diagnostic will provide an accurate, objective, and non-invasive method for mTBI diagnosis. Such a method is critically needed, as the number of pediatric mTBIs is on the rise, and the developing brains of young patients are more vulnerable to the after-effects of mechanical forces, leading to a wide range of negative effects on physical, cognitive, and psychological function. The diagnosis and assessment of mTBI in adolescents are challenging and rely on subjective measures, leading many mTBIs to go undiagnosed or underreported. This results in suboptimal post-injury treatment and patient management. A biologic assay to accurately diagnose adolescent mTBI would therefore provide an invaluable guide for clinical care, potentially guiding decisions for imaging, return to play, return to school, and therapeutic interventions. While a number of potential biomarkers for objectively detecting mTBI have been proposed, including the blood biomarkers glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and ubiquitin c-terminal hydrolase (UCH-L1), recent research questions the ability of blood-based biomarkers to differentiate patients with mTBI from those with acute orthopedic trauma, particularly in pediatric populations. Moreover, these assays require venipuncture expertise that is not always available, particularly in the case of sports-related concussions, which account for nearly 1/3 of mTBIs in this patient population. To address these shortcomings, Quadrant Biosciences is creating a novel, objective diagnostic tool based on a panel of saliva miRNA biomarkers that are differentially expressed in patients with mTBI. Pilot studies in over 200 individuals with mTBI have identified a panel of saliva miRNAs capable of diagnosing mTBI and predicting symptom duration. In the proposed Fast Track project, Quadrant will advance development of this test by establishing a rapid, accurate method for quantifying these miRNAs and refining/validating a diagnostic algorithm to differentiate adolescents and young adults with mTBI from peers with symptomology that mimics mTBI (e.g. chronic headaches, anxiety/depression, ADHD, exercise-related fatigue, and orthopedic injury). In Phase I, Quadrant will refine a diagnostic algorithm for mTBI using a rapid quantification technique for saliva miRNAs. Machine learning will be used to develop a diagnostic algorithm that employs miRNA levels from the rapid multiplex assay alongside participant medical and demographic characteristics to predict mTBI status. In Phase II, Quadrant will validate the diagnostic algorithm for differentiating mTBI from medical conditions with overlapping symptomology in a prospective, case-control study of 2500 adolescents and young adults (age 13–22 years) to refine the saliva-based diagnostic aid for mTBI. Ultimately, Quadrant’s proposed salivary miRNA-based test will yield a minimally invasive, objective, biologic test that can aid diagnosis of mTBI, including among patients with confounding psychologic conditions. Narrative - Children and adolescents account for approximately 2/3 of the 3 million concussions that occur in the U.S. each year, placing them at risk for negative impacts on physical, cognitive, and psychological function, including poor academic performance, behavior, social interactions, and reduced subsequent employment.

"Neurobehavioral mechanisms of parent-child extinction learning in adolescent PTSD Project Summary The goal of this proposal is to elucidate neurobehavioral mechanisms of parent-child extinction learning in early adolescent PTSD. Notably, deficits in directly learned fear extinction are implicated in adult PTSD. However, youth with PTSD live within the family system, which could impact their ability to extinguish trauma memories. Indeed, abnormal parent-child transmission of fear following trauma is a potent risk factor for youth PTSD. Furthermore, trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT), the gold-standard treatment for pediatric PTSD, uses exposure therapy of the child's trauma narrative for both youth and their caregiver. Here, TF-CBT aims to promote extinction of trauma-related fear both directly in the child and vicariously through parent modeling. However, no reported studies have examined the cumulative impact of direct and vicarious fear extinction in pediatric PTSD. Finally, the diagnosis of PTSD in youth continues to rely on DSM syndromal criteria, creating a great need to establish objective, biologically based diagnoses. This innovative research program will (1) identify physiological impairments in direct/vicarious fear extinction and their unique contributions to adolescent PTSD, (2) identify the neural substrates of fear acquisition and direct/vicarious extinction learning in adolescent PTSD, and (3) use machine learning on biomarkers of fear acquisition and direct/vicarious extinction to classify trauma exposure and PTSD diagnosis in adolescents. This interdisciplinary research team will recruit 40 non-traumatized typically developing (TD) youth, 40 trauma- exposed comparison (TEC) youth without mental illness, and 80 medication-free youth with PTSD, ages 10-14, along with their primary caregiving parent. Youth and parents will undergo fear acquisition followed by a novel fear extinction paradigm. Here, youth will undergo two extinction training conditions: 1) direct extinction and 2) vicarious extinction by observing their parent complete extinction training. Parent/child skin conductance and corrugator EMG will be measured during all fear protocol phases. Additionally, youth will complete all fear phases during fMRI to probe neural substrates of fear acquisition, and direct and vicarious extinction. Following physiological and fMRI analyses, a deep evolutionary machine learning approach will be applied to youth neurophysiological fear indices to classify trauma and PTSD status. Primary analyses will 1) examine physiological markers of direct and vicarious extinction in youth and their relative contribution to PTSD, 2) examine neural abnormalities during direct and vicarious extinction in adolescent PTSD, and 3) determine whether adding vicarious extinction markers enhances machine learning classification of youth trauma and PTSD status. This ambitious program of parent-child extinction learning promises to yield the first comprehensive set of neurophysiological markers of pediatric PTSD that will allow for objective, rational targeting of treatment in the parent-child dyad to improve outcomes for afflicted youth. Project Narrative This project seeks to conduct the first comprehensive, biological study of how parent-child fear and safety learning contribute to adolescent PTSD. This project will establish biomarkers of parent-child safety learning in adolescent PTSD, and test whether machine learning can use these markers to diagnose PTSD in youth. This research would represent a significant advance beyond subjective assessments currently used in clinical settings, paving the way towards biologically-based diagnosis and treatment of youth PTSD within the family context.",Neurobehavioral mechanisms of parent-child extinction learning in adolescent PTSD,10074037,R01MH117141,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Cognitive Therapy ', ' Cognition Therapy ', ' Cognitive Psychotherapy ', ' cognitive behavior intervention ', ' cognitive behavior modification ', ' cognitive behavior therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral intervention ', ' cognitive behavioral modification ', ' cognitive behavioral therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral treatment ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Emotions ', ' Exhibits ', ' Extinction (Psychology) ', ' Extinction ', ' behavioral extinction ', ' Family ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Female ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Galvanic Skin Response ', ' Electrodermal Response ', ' Psychogalvanic Reflex ', ' Skin Electric Conductance ', ' skin conductance ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' Learning ', ' male ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Parents ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Safety ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' PTSD ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' post-trauma stress disorder ', ' posttrauma stress disorder ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Adolescent ', ' Training ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Stimulus ', ' learning extinction ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Severities ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' girls ', ' response ', ' Address ', ' Biological Testing ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Physiologic Imaging ', ' physiological imaging ', ' Functional Imaging ', ' Scheme ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' care giving ', ' caregiving ', ' neurobehavioral ', ' facial processing ', ' Face Processing ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' Trauma ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' standard treatment ', ' standard care ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' early adolescence ', ' Structural malformation ', ' structural abnormalities ', ' structural anomalies ', ' Structural defect ', ' imaging platform ', ' prediction of response ', ' predictive response ', ' predictor of response ', ' response prediction ', ' predicting response ', ' improved outcome ', ' recruit ', ' exposure to trauma ', ' trauma exposure ', ' Differences between sexes ', ' Differs between sexes ', ' Sexual differences ', ' sex-dependent differences ', ' sex-related differences ', ' sex-specific differences ', ' Sex Differences ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2020,18249,WI-02,0.08362676576143796
"Imaging the neurodevelopmental trajectory of depression and anxiety disorders with HCP protocols Project summary: The main objectives of this project are to perform longitudinal collection of clinical, behavioral, and neuroimaging data from a cohort of adolescents with depression and anxiety disorders, as well as healthy controls; and to develop a set of analytical tools that can be used to study the developmental trajectory of brain structure and function in this population. The project builds on the ongoing collaboration of our team in a Connectomes Related to Human Disease U01 project, the Boston Adolescent Neuroimaging of Depression and Anxiety (BANDA) study, where we have been performing extensive clinical characterization and MRI scanning with Human Connectome Project (HCP) protocols on adolescents with depression and/or anxiety disorders and healthy controls. These baseline data (current total: N=170; final target: N=225) are set to become available publicly through the HCP database. Here we propose to collect longitudinal data on this unique, thoroughly characterized cohort. Following up on these subjects will allow us to investigate the complex relationship between longitudinal changes in neural circuitry and the onset, persistence, or recurrence of depression and anxiety disorders. We will tackle this by bringing together an investigative team with strong expertise in adolescent mood disorders and in neuroimaging data analysis. The MPIs have extensive experience in developing publicly available software tools for the analysis of brain connections from diffusion MRI (Yendiki) and functional MRI (Whitfield-Gabrieli). In this project, we propose to develop robust, automated tools for segmenting deep-brain structures and white-matter pathways that are of interest in psychiatric disorders. This development will build on our prior work in unbiased methods for longitudinal morphometric and tractography analyses. We will leverage the proposed longitudinal dataset and tools for accurate delineation of individual anatomy to perform a number of novel analyses that will go beyond conventional group-wise comparisons. Specifically, we will focus on analyses that allow us to predict clinical outcomes in individual subjects based on their neural circuitry. We will use machine-learning techniques to map the normative developmental trajectory of brain structure and function in healthy adolescents, including our controls and those from the development HCP. We will then investigate how and when the trajectories of individual adolescents with depression and/or anxiety disorders deviate from this normative trajectory. The longitudinal data set that we will collect and the software tools that we will develop will be shared with the research community. Our analysis methods will be applicable beyond this cohort, and could be used to study disease mechanisms and predict outcomes in a wide range of brain-related disorders across the human lifespan. Project narrative: This project will follow up on a cohort of adolescents with depression and/or anxiety disorders and healthy controls to collect clinical, behavioral, and neuroimaging data over time. Depression and anxiety disorders diagnosed during adolescence predict negative long-term consequences in adulthood. Clarifying the neural circuitry that contributes to the onset, persistence, and recurrence of depression and anxiety disorders is a key step towards developing novel biomarkers for earlier diagnosis, as well as novel treatment targets for more effective therapeutics.",Imaging the neurodevelopmental trajectory of depression and anxiety disorders with HCP protocols,10057408,R56MH121426,"['Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anxiety ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Award ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Boston ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Communities ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Interest Group ', ' Interview ', ' Literature ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Patients ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' method development ', ' Clinical ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Adolescent ', ' Individual ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' data quality ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' depressed ', ' sadness ', ' Depressed mood ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Hour ', ' Complex ', ' Scanning ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Techniques ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' interest ', ' age group ', ' Brain scan ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' human data ', ' behavioral measure ', ' behavioral measurement ', ' behavior measurement ', ' cohort ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' substantia alba ', ' white matter ', ' behavioral test ', ' behavior test ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' disease subgroups ', ' disease subtype ', ' disorder subtype ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' MRI Scans ', ' DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) ', ' DWI-MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion weighted imaging ', ' Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' dMRI ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Predictive Value ', ' disease mechanisms study ', ' in vivo ', ' Collection ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' comparator group ', ' comparison group ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' adolescent depression ', ' adolescents with depression ', ' childhood depression ', ' childhood onset depression ', ' depressed adolescents ', ' depression in adolescence ', ' pediatric depression ', ' youth depression ', ' child depression ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' analytical tool ', ' human disease ', ' high risk ', ' multi-modality ', ' multimodality ', ' new marker ', ' novel biomarker ', ' novel marker ', ' followup assessment ', ' follow up assessment ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' anxious ', ' individual patient ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' outcome prediction ', ' connectome ', ' clinical outcome prediction ', ' predictor of clinical outcome ', ' predict clinical outcome ', ' longitudinal data set ', ' longitudinal dataset ', ' tractography ', ' clinical translation ', ' high dimensionality ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R56,2020,1225770,MA-08,0.05430419346144057
"Analyzing Sequential, Multiple Assignment, Randomized Trials in the Presence of Partial Compliance Project Summary: The cyclical and heterogeneous nature of many substance use disorders highlights the need to adapt the type or the dose of treatment to accommodate the specific and changing needs of individuals. This proposal is motivated by the Extending Treatment Effectiveness of Naltrexone and the Adaptive Treatment for Cocaine Dependence trials, sequential multiple assignment randomized trials (SMART) designed to find a (personalized) rescue treatment for alcohol or/and cocaine dependent patients. One of the main challenges in these trials is the high rate of noncompliance to the assigned treatments. This feature has made it virtually impossible for investigators to fully explore the possibility of building high quality treatment strategies using the data. Our overarching aim is to address this particular challenge through developing and subsequently applying new statistical methods to the data. A SMART trial is a multi-stage trial that can inform the design of an adaptive treatment strategy (ATS) which formalizes an individualized treatment plan and where current treatment strategy can depend on a patient's past medical and treatment history. An optimal ATS is one that maximizes a specified health outcome of interest. Existing methods in analyzing SMART data are limited to intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses. That is the treatment effect at each stage is estimated based on the treatment group to which an individual was randomized at that stage regardless of whether the individual complied with their assigned treatment. One major concern is that the relationship between the experimental manipulation and the outcome may be confounded by treatment noncompliance. We develop methodologies that can be used to adjust for noncompliance in analyzing data collected in SMARTs. Specifically, we extend the principal strata framework and Bayesian Copulas to multi-stage randomized trials setting and propose novel procedures that estimate the mean outcome under different ATSs. We also propose a novel Bayesian machine learning approach that can be used to construct deeply tailored (i.e., individualized) treatment strategies that take into account patients' demographic factors, measures of mental health and alcohol use, obsessive-compulsive drinking and alcohol craving scales, physical composite scores. Finally, we will develop easy-to-use, publicly available open-source software leveraging the R and Python languages that implements our methods. This will provide an expandable platform that will assist researchers in developing new optimal ATSs for patients suffering from alcoholism and other substance use disorders. Narrative: This project aims to address the need for robust, rigorous and computationally efficient methods for analysis of sequential multiple assignment randomized trials (SMARTs) data in the presence of partial compliance. The methods developed in this project will improve the usefulness, interpretability and generalizability of the results obtained by SMARTs and help mental health and substance use disorder scientists to develop more potent adaptive treatment strategies to guide the individualization of mental health and substance use disorder treatments.","Analyzing Sequential, Multiple Assignment, Randomized Trials in the Presence of Partial Compliance",10017030,R01DA048764,"['Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' EtOH use ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol use ', ' Cocaine ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Joints ', ' Language ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Maps ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Naltrexone ', ' Nalorex ', ' Nemexin ', ' ReVia ', ' Vivitrol ', ' Patients ', ' Periodicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' statistics ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' symposium ', ' Treatment Effectiveness ', ' Intention ', ' base ', ' dosage ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Medical ', ' Pythons ', ' Individual ', ' Bayesian Methodology ', ' Bayesian Statistical Method ', ' Bayesian approaches ', ' Bayesian classification method ', ' Bayesian classification procedure ', ' Bayesian posterior distribution ', ' Bayesian Method ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Scientist ', ' non-compliant ', ' noncompliance ', ' noncompliant ', ' non-compliance ', ' interest ', ' ethanol craving ', ' alcohol craving ', ' Performance ', ' treatment planning ', ' obsessive compulsive ', ' Obsessive compulsive behavior ', ' Cocaine Addiction ', ' Cocaine Dependence ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' drinking ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' response ', ' depository ', ' repository ', ' alcohol abuse treatment ', ' alcohol treatment ', ' alcohol abuse therapy ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Patient Compliance ', ' patient adherence ', ' patient cooperation ', ' therapy compliance ', ' therapy cooperation ', ' treatment compliance ', ' compliance behavior ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Stratification ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' Scheme ', ' Characteristics ', ' virtual ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Alcoholism ', ' treatment effect ', ' open source ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy design ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' treatment response ', ' treatment strategy ', ' Randomization trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' arm ', ' customized therapy ', ' customized treatment ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' individualized therapy ', ' individualized treatment ', ' patient specific therapies ', ' patient specific treatment ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' tailored therapy ', ' tailored treatment ', ' unique treatment ', ' individualized medicine ', ' trial design ', ' treatment group ', ' patient specific response ', ' responsive patient ', ' patient response ', ' Bayesian machine learning ', ' Bayesian learning ', ' Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R01,2020,383812,NY-25,-0.04065371789595075
"Modified Use of E-cigarettes and Marketing on YouTube PROJECT SUMMARY E-cigarette use among U.S. youth is a significant public health problem. Understanding youth appeal of e- cigarettes and marketing strategies targeting youth is critical to inform the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)’s goal to prevent youth e-cigarette use. A significant youth appeal is the ability to modify e-cigarettes or to “hack” the devices or e-liquid constituents for unintended purposes (e.g., using at higher temperatures or for a longer period of time, adding their own e-liquids made with nicotine or THC oil). However, it is largely unknown how youth modify e-cigarette devices or their components, their perceptions of these behaviors, and marketing strategies used to endorse these behaviors. YouTube, a popular social media, can be examined to understand modified uses of e-cigarettes and marketing associated with these behaviors. The overall goal of this study is to understand ways in which youth modify e-cigarettes, their motivations for doing so, and marketing sources, using YouTube analysis, survey methodology, and expert evaluation. We will identify modified uses of e-cigarettes and marketing using fictitious youth YouTube viewer profiles to search for e-cigarettes using a browser plug-in and custom scripted web-crawling and then machine learning to automatically code the videos to identify e-cigarette modifications and marketing source. Our Advisory Committee (AC) of subject matter experts in tobacco regulatory science, social media, youth tobacco use, toxicology, communications, and tobacco marketing will apply their knowledge to assess the potential impact of these identified modified uses on appeal, addiction, and health effects of e-cigarettes to identify those which are amenable to FDA regulations and communications. We will then conduct an in-depth analysis of these selected behaviors using a combination of machine learning and detailed human coding on youth-accessible YouTube videos to understand: 1) components that are modified (e.g., batteries, cartridges/pods, e-liquids), 2) motivations for modification (e.g., enhance user experience, reduce perceived harm), 3) marketing sources (e.g., online shops, pro-e-cigarette organizations), and 4) appeal (number of likes, views). We will also use an online survey with adolescent and young adult e-cigarette users (N=1000) to examine the prevalence, appeal, motivations, risk perceptions, and marketing exposure related to these modified uses and their predictors (i.e., demographic variables, past-month e-cigarette use frequency, e-cigarette dependence, other tobacco/substance use, interpersonal and intrapersonal risk factors). The results of this study will provide the FDA with novel evidence to 1) develop regulations to prohibit the manufacturing and marketing of e-cigarette components that can be modified by youth, 2) restrict youth-accessible marketing of e-cigarettes on social media such as YouTube, and 3) develop prevention campaigns to educate youth about the harms of modifying e-cigarettes. PROJECT NARRATIVE PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: E-cigarette use among youth is high; thus, to inform youth e-cigarette prevention, we will examine the youth appeal of the product, such as the ability to modify or “hack” the devices and their related components for unintended uses and marketing on popular social media, YouTube. We will use mixed-methods (i.e., machine learning, survey methodology, expert evaluation) to achieve our aim.

"Delineating neurobiological heterogeneity in internalizing symptoms using machine learning and deep phenotyping Symptom-based classification approaches based on the DSM 5 are often not supported by epidemiological, genetic, and clinical neuroimaging research and may impede the advancement of interventions that target the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying mental health disorders. A novel alternative to classifying psychopathology based on presenting clinical symptoms is to identify neurobiologically-informed biotypes. Individuals are clustered according to shared patterns of brain dysfunction using data-driven machine learning techniques to reveal the heterogeneous biological mechanisms that underlie comorbid disorders. Internalizing symptoms often first begin during development, suggesting that this is a critical period of vulnerability. Additionally, strong sex differences are found in anxiety and depressive symptoms, starting in adolescence. Thus, studies are needed that examine sex differences in the neurobiological mechanisms associated with internalizing symptoms during development. The purpose of the current study is to uncover the neurobiological heterogeneity associated with internalizing symptoms in youth. During the K99 phase, Aim 1 will use machine-learning techniques to delineate patterns of neurobiological heterogeneity among youth with anxiety and depressive disorders using multimodal neuroimaging data from a large community-based sample of over 1,200 youth studied as part of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC; Training phase). We will test these heterogeneous patterns on a hold-out sample from the same cohort to examine the model’s validity (Validation phase). While the PNC provides an ideal dataset for developing a model, it does not have paradigms relevant to fear and anxiety that would allow us to identify important phenotypic differences between biotypes. Thus, Aim 2 will evaluate the generalizability of this model in an independent sample collected during the R00 phase, and further characterize these biotypes using pertinent measures related to error and reward processing. Finally, Aim 3 will investigate how sex differences in brain development associate with heterogeneous neural patterns in internalizing symptoms. Dr. Kaczkurkin’s long-term goal is to establish an independent research program where she will use advanced multi-modal neuroimaging techniques to study the mechanisms underlying internalizing disorders in youth. This study will provide a unique opportunity to capitalize on the PNC database at the University of Pennsylvania to develop a well-validated model while also collecting a refined independent dataset, which will provide Dr. Kaczkurkin with the training and experience needed to transition to an independent research career.

"Temperamental emotionality in preschoolers and depression risk PROJECT SUMMARY Depressive disorders (DD) are one of the most prevalent forms of mental disorders, and are associated with significant mortality, morbidity, and economic costs. The incidence of DD begins to increase in early-mid adolescence and peaks in emerging adulthood. The Stony Brook Temperament Study is a longitudinal study that seeks to identify early behavioral and neural precursors and risk factors for DD and understand the neurobiological and psychosocial processes through which these early manifestations develop into clinically significant psychopathology. We initially assessed a large community sample of 3-year old children, and have followed them at 3-year intervals through age 15. This competing renewal application seeks to re-evaluate the sample at ages 18 and 21. Specifically, we propose to trace pathways from laboratory observations of temperamental low positive emotionality and high negative emotionality at age 3 to neural indices of emotional and social information processing and DD symptoms and onsets from middle childhood through emerging adulthood. In addition, we seek to understand how life stress over the lifespan and the developmental challenges of emerging adulthood contribute to risk for DD, and to examine the specificity of these risk pathways in comparison with anxiety and substance use disorders. Finally, we will use cutting-edge machine learning techniques to maximize prediction of DD and understand which domains and developmental periods contribute most to prediction. This information about risk pathways and processes should contribute to understanding when and how to intervene in order to prevent DD and limit their progression.

"Biobehavioral Predictors of Illness Progression in Adolescent Depression PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Adolescent depression is a major public health concern associated with significant morbidity and mortality. We know that adolescent depression varies considerably in severity and course, but its underlying mechanisms remain unknown. This proposal addresses this concern, aiming to identify biobehavioral predictors of illness trajectory in adolescents to inform treatment influencing its course. Our overall hypothesis is that reward dysfunction and its underlying neuro-immunological mechanisms contribute to maintenance of depression in youth. We propose the following model: (1) peripheral inflammation (e.g., cytokines, kynurenines) is associated with anhedonia; (2) inflammation extends to the CNS, inducing oxidative stress [↓glutathione (GSH, antioxidant)] and GABA (inhibitory neurotransmitter) deficits; (3) such neuro-chemical changes alter the reward circuitry, leading to anhedonia, and contribute to depression progression. In support, we documented that of adolescent depression’s core symptoms, only anhedonia—reflecting deficits in reward processes—and not irritability was associated with worse outcome, including suicidality and chronicity. We also reported associations between circulatory cytokines and kynurenines with both anhedonia and reward neurocircuitry. Utilizing proton MR spectroscopy (1H MRS), we showed that decreased anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) GABA in adolescent depression was driven by anhedonia. Additionally, using fMRI, we mapped striatal-based connectivity in relation to anhedonia and documented distinct neural activation patterns of reward anticipation and attainment—both reward processes that contribute to anhedonia. In pilot studies, we found that ACC GABA and reward- anticipation brain activation predicted anhedonia severity at 2-year follow-up. Building upon our compelling findings to date, we propose a prospective study of reward processes and neuroimmunological mechanisms, with the goal to identify modifiable pathways predictive of depression course in adolescents. We will study 120 adolescents with depressive symptoms. Three in-laboratory comprehensive clinical evaluation and computerized reward task sessions will be done at baseline, 12-, and 24-month follow-ups. At baseline and 12 months, visits will include: a) immune blood collection for kynurenine metabolites, immune cell profiling, and cytokine secretion post immune stimulation (as a biological stressor); b) fMRI resting state and tasks examining distinct reward processes (e.g., anticipation, attainment, learning); and c) 1H MRS to probe ACC GABA and striatal GSH as indices for inflammatory neurometabolic consequences in reward-related brain regions. Outcome measures will include anhedonia severity (primary), along with depression severity, functioning, anxiety, and suicidality. Principled variable selection approach will address multiple comparison concerns. Dynamic causal modeling and machine learning classification methods will explore the relationships among all examined factors.  PROJECT NARRATIVE Our overall goal is to better understand the mechanisms contributing to the maintenance and severity of adolescent depression. A prospective multimodal study will test the overall hypothesis that reward dysfunction and associated neuroimmunological abnormalities contribute to depression progression in youth. Such work would provide information on modifiable factors to facilitate novel treatment approaches influencing the course of illness early on and prior to chronicity effects, so that we may work to ameliorate morbidity and mortality of this devastating disorder.",Biobehavioral Predictors of Illness Progression in Adolescent Depression,9907663,R01MH120601,"['Accounting ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Antioxidants ', ' anti-oxidant ', ' Anxiety ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Striatum ', ' striatal ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Exhibits ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' gamma-Aminobutyric Acid ', ' 4-Aminobutanoic Acid ', ' 4-Aminobutyric Acid ', ' 4-amino-butanoic acid ', ' Aminalon ', ' Aminalone ', ' GABA ', ' γ-Aminobutyric Acid ', ' Gambling ', ' Glutathione ', ' gamma-L-Glu-L-Cys-Gly ', ' gamma-L-Glutamyl-L-Cysteinylglycine ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Cetacort ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cortef ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortril ', ' Dermacort ', ' Eldecort ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Hytone ', ' Nutracort ', ' Proctocort ', ' Immunization ', ' Immunologic Sensitization ', ' Immunologic Stimulation ', ' Immunological Sensitization ', ' Immunological Stimulation ', ' Immunostimulation ', ' indexing ', ' Inflammation ', ' Kynurenine ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy ', ' MR Spectroscopy ', ' Maintenance ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' neurochemistry ', ' neurochemical ', ' Neurotransmitters ', ' Nerve Transmitter Substances ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Play ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Protons ', ' H+ element ', ' Hydrogen Ions ', ' Puberty ', ' Public Health ', ' Rest ', ' Rewards ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Stress ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' cytokine ', ' Measures ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Mediating ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Anhedonia ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' Anterior ', ' Peripheral ', ' Chronic ', ' Biological ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Adolescent ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Inflammatory ', ' depressed ', ' sadness ', ' Depressed mood ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Adopted ', ' Investigation ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Severities ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' Visit ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' cingulate cortex ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' pleasure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Modeling ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Sum ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' clinical test ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Collection ', ' Immunochemical Immunologic ', ' Immunologic ', ' Immunological ', ' Immunologically ', ' Immunologics ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' biobehavioral ', ' biobehavior ', ' reward circuitry ', ' computerized ', ' subthreshold depression ', ' adolescent depression ', ' adolescents with depression ', ' childhood depression ', ' childhood onset depression ', ' depressed adolescents ', ' depression in adolescence ', ' pediatric depression ', ' youth depression ', ' child depression ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' Individual Differences ', ' Trauma ', ' multi-modality ', ' multimodality ', ' primary outcome ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' RDoC ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' behavior construct ', ' behavioral construct ', ' causal diagram ', ' causal model ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' outcome prediction ', ' reward anticipation ', ' ']",NIMH,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,850634,NY-14,0.05875266176938531
"Course and Outcome of Bipolar Disorder in Youth ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Course and Outcome of Bipolar Disorders in Youth (COBY) study has comprehensively characterized the clinical course of a large sample of youth with bipolar disorder (BD), and has identified demographic and clinical factors that are associated with different illness courses. To date, however, COBY has not included neuroimaging assessments. Including such assessments now will allow, for the first time, an evaluation of the impact of 13-year course of BD and treatment upon neural circuitry function and structure. Furthermore, the majority of COBY participants are currently between 18-30 years old, when the brain, and prefrontal cortex in particular, continues to develop. Including neuroimaging assessments in COBY participants now can thus take advantage of the neurodevelopmental processes occurring between 18-30 years where there are unique opportunities to intervene therapeutically to help normalize abnormalities in neural functioning and structure. Focusing on this age range will also provide a critically important opportunity to determine the extent to which neuroimaging measures predict future clinical course in adulthood. Having normal prefrontal cortical function and structure may predict better clinical course in adulthood, even in COBY participants with poor clinical course in youth, and may lead to decisions to reduce, or even stop, specific treatments in these individuals. In the proposed study, we will determine how previous BD clinical course (e.g., % time with mood symptoms vs. euthymic; % time with comorbid disorders) and treatment exposure from childhood into adulthood impacts neural circuitry functioning and structure supporting key NIMH RDoC information processing domains, and compare neuroimaging findings in COBY participants with those of demographically-matched healthy controls (Aim 1). We will also determine whether neuroimaging measures predict illness course in adulthood, beyond demographic and clinical factors, and previous clinical course in youth (Aim 2). We will use machine learning to explore patterns of wholebrain functioning, white and gray matter structure, and clinical and demographic measures, that most accurately predict future clinical course at the individual subject level. The proposed study also provides a valuable opportunity to inform the field regarding the clinical and functional course and outcome from youth into adulthood in a large, well-characterized sample of people with BD. This is important because the clinical outcome of BD youth in adulthood remains uncertain, as only two studies with a total of 72 subjects followed BD youth into their early twenties. Structural and functional neuroimaging techniques will be employed in a representative subsample of COBY participants (n=120), and healthy controls (n=50). Comprehensive assessments of psychopathology and functioning will be collected at the time of neuroimaging, and twice more during the proposed project period in the 120 COBY participants. This proposal accords with the NIMH's mission to define developmental trajectories of mental disorders and develop strategies to better define risk and protective factors for disease trajectories across the lifespan, and with the RDoC initiative. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The aim of the proposed study is to identify the impact of long-term previous clinical course and treatment on the brain in individuals with childhood-onset bipolar disorder, and examine how these changes in the brain influence future clinical course during adulthood. The participants are currently between 18-30 years old when the brain begins to achieve full maturity. Thus, this study will provide a unique opportunity to determine the extent to which neuroimaging measures predict future clinical course during an important neurodevelopmental period in individuals with bipolar disorder and can yield findings that will aid treatment decisions for these individuals.",Course and Outcome of Bipolar Disorder in Youth,9890000,R01MH059929,"['Accounting ', ' Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Anxiety ', ' Arousal ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Future ', ' gray matter ', ' substantia grisea ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Literature ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Mission ', ' Moods ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Rest ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' Medial ', ' Clinical ', ' Fiber ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' disease onset ', ' disorder onset ', ' Onset of illness ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Exposure to ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' psychosocial ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' Participant ', ' substantia alba ', ' white matter ', ' neural function ', ' Neurophysiology - biologic function ', ' abuse of substances ', ' substance abuse ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' Ventral Striatum ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Emotional ', ' Sampling ', ' Symptoms ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' Process ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' positive emotion ', ' positive emotional state ', ' Outcome ', ' Impact evaluation ', ' early therapy ', ' Early treatment ', ' reward processing ', ' cognitive control ', ' critical period ', ' information processing ', ' public health relevance ', ' multi-modality ', ' multimodality ', ' neural patterning ', ' RDoC ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' Positive Valence ', ' Negative Valence ', ' symptomatology ', ' co-morbid symptom ', ' co-occuring symptom ', ' comorbid symptom ', ' concurrent symptom ', ' cooccuring symptom ', ' symptom association ', ' symptom comorbidity ', ' associated symptom ', ' mood symptom ', ' protective factors ', ' pre-clinical imaging ', ' preclinical imaging ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,620389,PA-18,0.06677565500068593
"Neurobehavioral mechanisms of parent-child extinction learning in adolescent PTSD Project Summary The goal of this proposal is to elucidate neurobehavioral mechanisms of parent-child extinction learning in early adolescent PTSD. Notably, deficits in directly learned fear extinction are implicated in adult PTSD. However, youth with PTSD live within the family system, which could impact their ability to extinguish trauma memories. Indeed, abnormal parent-child transmission of fear following trauma is a potent risk factor for youth PTSD. Furthermore, trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT), the gold-standard treatment for pediatric PTSD, uses exposure therapy of the child's trauma narrative for both youth and their caregiver. Here, TF-CBT aims to promote extinction of trauma-related fear both directly in the child and vicariously through parent modeling. However, no reported studies have examined the cumulative impact of direct and vicarious fear extinction in pediatric PTSD. Finally, the diagnosis of PTSD in youth continues to rely on DSM syndromal criteria, creating a great need to establish objective, biologically based diagnoses. This innovative research program will (1) identify physiological impairments in direct/vicarious fear extinction and their unique contributions to adolescent PTSD, (2) identify the neural substrates of fear acquisition and direct/vicarious extinction learning in adolescent PTSD, and (3) use machine learning on biomarkers of fear acquisition and direct/vicarious extinction to classify trauma exposure and PTSD diagnosis in adolescents. This interdisciplinary research team will recruit 40 non-traumatized typically developing (TD) youth, 40 trauma- exposed comparison (TEC) youth without mental illness, and 80 medication-free youth with PTSD, ages 10-14, along with their primary caregiving parent. Youth and parents will undergo fear acquisition followed by a novel fear extinction paradigm. Here, youth will undergo two extinction training conditions: 1) direct extinction and 2) vicarious extinction by observing their parent complete extinction training. Parent/child skin conductance and corrugator EMG will be measured during all fear protocol phases. Additionally, youth will complete all fear phases during fMRI to probe neural substrates of fear acquisition, and direct and vicarious extinction. Following physiological and fMRI analyses, a deep evolutionary machine learning approach will be applied to youth neurophysiological fear indices to classify trauma and PTSD status. Primary analyses will 1) examine physiological markers of direct and vicarious extinction in youth and their relative contribution to PTSD, 2) examine neural abnormalities during direct and vicarious extinction in adolescent PTSD, and 3) determine whether adding vicarious extinction markers enhances machine learning classification of youth trauma and PTSD status. This ambitious program of parent-child extinction learning promises to yield the first comprehensive set of neurophysiological markers of pediatric PTSD that will allow for objective, rational targeting of treatment in the parent-child dyad to improve outcomes for afflicted youth. Project Narrative This project seeks to conduct the first comprehensive, biological study of how parent-child fear and safety learning contribute to adolescent PTSD. This project will establish biomarkers of parent-child safety learning in adolescent PTSD, and test whether machine learning can use these markers to diagnose PTSD in youth. This research would represent a significant advance beyond subjective assessments currently used in clinical settings, paving the way towards biologically-based diagnosis and treatment of youth PTSD within the family context.",Neurobehavioral mechanisms of parent-child extinction learning in adolescent PTSD,9850289,R01MH117141,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Cognitive Therapy ', ' Cognition Therapy ', ' Cognitive Psychotherapy ', ' cognitive behavior intervention ', ' cognitive behavior modification ', ' cognitive behavior therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral intervention ', ' cognitive behavioral modification ', ' cognitive behavioral therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral treatment ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Emotions ', ' Exhibits ', ' Extinction (Psychology) ', ' Extinction ', ' behavioral extinction ', ' Family ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Female ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Galvanic Skin Response ', ' Electrodermal Response ', ' Psychogalvanic Reflex ', ' Skin Electric Conductance ', ' skin conductance ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' Learning ', ' male ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Parents ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Safety ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' PTSD ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' post-trauma stress disorder ', ' posttrauma stress disorder ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Adolescent ', ' Training ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Stimulus ', ' learning extinction ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Severities ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' girls ', ' response ', ' Address ', ' Biological Testing ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Physiologic Imaging ', ' physiological imaging ', ' Functional Imaging ', ' Scheme ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' care giving ', ' caregiving ', ' neurobehavioral ', ' facial processing ', ' Face Processing ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' Trauma ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' standard treatment ', ' standard care ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' early adolescence ', ' Structural malformation ', ' structural abnormalities ', ' structural anomalies ', ' Structural defect ', ' imaging platform ', ' prediction of response ', ' predictive response ', ' predictor of response ', ' response prediction ', ' predicting response ', ' improved outcome ', ' recruit ', ' exposure to trauma ', ' trauma exposure ', ' Differences between sexes ', ' Differs between sexes ', ' Sexual differences ', ' sex-dependent differences ', ' sex-related differences ', ' sex-specific differences ', ' Sex Differences ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2020,735296,WI-02,0.08362676576143796
"Predicting the onset of depression in at-risk adolescents from endophenotype profiles Project Summary/Abstract  Major depressive disorder (MDD) is uncommon in childhood, but becomes increasingly prevalent during adolescence. By the age of 18, about 15% of adolescents will have experienced at least one episode of MDD, with females twice as likely than males to have suffered an episode. This developmental surge in depression is especially high among teens who have a parent with a history of MDD, with close to half developing the disorder by the end of adolescence. Despite these epidemiological findings, and the range of negative downstream consequences linked to MDD, there are strikingly little data on the neural and behavioral abnormalities that confer risk for future depression onset in youth. The ability to prospectively predict MDD prior to its onset would have important clinical implications for the early identification of – and targeted deployment of interventions for – at-risk youth, which is strongly aligned with the NIMH Strategic Plan.  To address these gaps, adolescents ages 12-15 at increased risk of MDD onset by virtue of a parental history of MDD, as well as a control sample with no parental history of depression, will complete baseline neural (fMRI) and behavioral assessments of replicated endophenotypes of MDD (neuroticism, anhedonia, cognitive control deficits). Growing evidence and our preliminary data suggest that these endophenotypes are relatively stable trait-like risk markers, have non-overlapping neural substrates, and precede and prospectively predict depression onset. The project has three aims. First, we will evaluate the neural correlates of these three endophenotypes in an adolescent sample (n = 148), half of whom are at elevated risk of MDD (Aim 1). Second, during a 24-month follow-up phase, participants will be contacted by phone every 6 months and administered measures to assess changes in symptoms. Analyses will test whether behavioral and neural endophenotype measures prospectively predict onset of depressive symptoms during the follow-up phase. Importantly, to evaluate incremental predictive validity, we will test whether each endophenotype measure predicts future depressive symptoms above and beyond relevant clinical, familial/demographic and developmental variables previously linked with risk of future depression (Aim 2). Third, we will test whether multivariate machine learning models incorporating behavioral and neural endophenotype markers, as well as clinical, familial/demographic, and developmental characteristics, can be used to predict subject-specific risk of future depression onset with sufficiently high sensitivity and specificity to be clinically useful (Aim 3). Critically, recent advances in machine learning allow for the development of algorithms predicting risk at the individual level, as well as the integration of numerous predictors rather than relying on single variables that may, in isolation, have limited clinically-useful predictive value. Collectively, results are expected to advance our ability to predict the onset of depressive symptoms and, ultimately, to inform the development of a freely available, web-based risk calculator for predicting subject-specific depression risk. Project Narrative The prevalence of depression increases dramatically during adolescence, particularly for females. Using machine learning algorithms, the overarching goal of the project is to identify neural and behavioral markers that – in combination with clinical and demographic characteristics – reliably predict risk of developing depression during adolescence. The ability to prospectively predict depression prior to its initial onset would have important clinical implications for the early identification of – and targeted deployment of interventions for – at-risk youth.",Predicting the onset of depression in at-risk adolescents from endophenotype profiles,9836889,R01MH116969,"['Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Behavior ', ' Cluster Analysis ', ' Cluster Analyses ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Control Groups ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' indexing ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' Inventory ', ' Literature ', ' single episode major depressive disorder ', ' Single major depression ', ' Single major depressive episode ', ' major depressive episode ', ' single episode Major Depression ', ' male ', ' Maps ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurotic Disorders ', ' Neuroses ', ' Psychoneuroses ', ' neurotic ', ' neuroticism ', ' Online Systems ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' online computer ', ' web based ', ' Parents ', ' Research ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Measures ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' surrogate bio-markers ', ' surrogate biomarkers ', ' Surrogate Markers ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Anhedonia ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' disease onset ', ' disorder onset ', ' Onset of illness ', ' depressed ', ' sadness ', ' Depressed mood ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' Remission ', ' Disease remission ', ' experience ', ' behavioral measure ', ' behavioral measurement ', ' behavior measurement ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' trait ', ' pleasure ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Early identification ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' behavioral assessment ', ' Behavior assessment ', ' clinical depression ', ' major depression ', ' major depression disorder ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Subgroup ', ' Risk Marker ', ' Teen ', ' teen years ', ' teenage ', ' Teenagers ', ' Characteristics ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' cognitive system ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' endophenotype ', ' cognitive control ', ' RDoC ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' Positive Valence ', ' Negative Valence ', ' anxious symptom ', ' anxiety symptoms ', ' neural correlate ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' recruit ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' algorithm development ', ' kernel learning ', ' multi-kernel learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' ']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,R01,2020,563046,MA-05,0.05904836926585357
"Community-Based Care for Minority Adolescents with ADHD: Improving Fidelity with Machine Learning-Assisted Supervision and Fidelity Feedback Project Summary  The proposed study will develop and evaluate a technology-assisted supervision protocol to promote treatment fidelity and more efficient delivery of evidence-based treatment (EBT) for ADHD in under-resourced community settings. The protocol (LC4S) will be grounded in the principles of measurement-based care. LC4S will task-shift basic supervision tasks to an existing machine learning tool that analyzes and codes therapy recordings for fidelity (Lyssn; lyssn.io; Tanana et al., 2019). These data will be automatically integrated into an established HIPAA-compliant online clinical dashboard that produces performance reports for therapists and supervisors (Care4; www.care4soft.net). Care4 also will be loaded with online facilitation resources for therapists, while supervisors will be trained to lead weekly in-person supervision sessions according to best practices in measurement-based care (Martino et al., 2016; Schoenwald et al., 2009; Webster-Stratton et al., 2014). This trial will be conducted in three community mental health agencies (Psych Solutions, Inc, Behavioral Aid Solutions, Jewish Community Services) in Miami-Dade County, FL that serve low income ethnic/racial minority youth and previously partnered with the research team in R01 MH106587. In Y01 of the project, we will conduct a stakeholder-focused development process for the LC4S intervention that begins with a thorough capacity and needs assessment using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR; Damschroder et al., 2009) and is guided by the Knowledge to Action (K2A) Implementation Science Framework (Graham et al., 2006). In this phase, we will hold monthly videoconference meetings between development teams at each agency, Care4, and the investigative team to iterate the final Care4 interface with an emphasis user-centered design. In year 1, we also will conduct a small open trial to obtain user feedback (12 cases, 3 supervisors, and 6 therapists) on LC4S and we will make final adaptations to the technology and protocol. In year 2, we will conduct a pilot Hybrid Type 3 Implementation- Effectiveness randomized controlled trial (Curran et al., 2012; N=72 youth; 24 youth, 8 therapists, and 2 supervisors per agency) that will randomly assign both therapists and youth to the LC4S condition or enhanced supervision as usual (ESAU). Both supervision conditions will be delivered by endogenous, agency supervisors who are trained in delivery of the EBT and the core elements of its supervision and have access to monthly phone consultation from experts. The proximal target in this R34 pilot RCT is session by session fidelity scores. The distal service delivery outcomes in this trial are: (1) quality of EBT implementation, (2) quantity of EBT delivered in standard intervention time frame, and (3) speed of delivery (i.e., number of sessions and days to EBT completion) for each case. In support of a future R01 that measures the impact of LC4S on patient outcomes across multiple EBTs, this R34 will also focus on developing and validating appropriate study measures, testing for contamination across conditions, and establishing the costs of the LC4S intervention versus ESAU. Project Narrative Evidence-based behavior therapy for ADHD demonstrates a decrement in fidelity and effectiveness when moving from university to community settings, largely due to limited resources in poor communities (Sibley, Graziano, Coxe, Bickman, & Martin, 2020). As a result, access to quality mental health care suffers among minority, socio-economically disadvantaged adolescents who commonly seek care in these settings and are at risk for the worst clinical outcomes (Sibley, Coxe, Stein, & Meinzer, 2020). Artificial Intelligence (AI) and web-based technology can be used to automate and task-shift key supervision and training tasks (i.e., fidelity monitoring and feedback, booster trainings) thus improving fidelity and effectiveness while reducing costs associated with burdensome measurement-based supervision protocols (Tanana et al., 2019).",Community-Based Care for Minority Adolescents with

"Mechanisms linking neighborhood poverty to problematic adolescent drug use PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Where a child grows up can inﬂuence his or her risk of problematic drug use. Surprisingly, policies and programs designed to improve neighborhood conditions have yielded conﬂicting results in which some children beneﬁt but others are harmed. Understanding the mechanisms by which neighborhoods act to affect problem- atic drug use and how these mechanisms differ across subgroups and cities—that is, understanding where and for whom mechanisms apply—is essential to optimize the effectiveness of future neighborhood interventions. Mechanisms involving mediation by aspects of the school environment have been unexamined, but could prove promising for understanding differential effects of neighborhood on problematic drug use. The objective of this K99/R00 is to identify school-based mechanisms that mediate the relationship between neighborhood poverty and problematic drug use and to develop statistical methods to understand how mediation effects differ across subgroup and place. This objective contributes to the long-term goal of improving the effectiveness of interven- tions to prevent drug abuse and dependence by tailoring interventions to address the most relevant mechanisms of action for each target population based on place and individual-level characteristics. The K99 phase ﬁlls the following training gaps that are critical to achieving the research objective and long-term goal: 1) methodologic training in causal mediation analysis; 2) subject-matter training in drug abuse and dependence prevention in ur- ban populations; and 3) involvement in real-world school-based interventions to develop methods with practical utility. Aim 1 of the proposed research identiﬁes the school environment mechanisms that mediate the relationship between neighborhood poverty and adolescent problematic drug use and modiﬁers of those mechanisms. Aim 2 extends a statistical method recently developed by the proposed research team for generalizing intervention ef- fects from one city to another to generalizing mediation effects. Finally, Aim 3 uses the method developed in Aim 2 to identify how the school environment mechanisms mediating neighborhood poverty and problematic drug use differ across major U.S. cities. The proposed research is expected to identify school-based mechanisms underly- ing differential effects of neighborhood poverty on adolescent problematic drug use by subgroup and place using the only study of randomized neighborhood residence. In addition, it is expected to contribute a novel statistical method that incorporates cutting-edge machine learning techniques to identify which mediation mechanisms can generalize across place, advancing translational research. Successful interventions are assumed to work in differ- ent settings, but that is not the case in practice. The proposed research will allow us to predict intervention effects while accounting for differences in population composition and modiﬁers of the mediation mechanism. This will make a signiﬁcant contribution to improving health by informing the design and targeting of future neighborhood interventions to adolescents and places that may be most impacted in terms of problematic drug use prevention. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed research is to expected to advance understanding of how two important contexts—neighborhood and school—act together to inﬂuence problematic drug use among adolescents, including how these mechanisms differ across adolescent subgroups and places. In addition, the proposed research will result in the development of a ﬂexible statistical method to predict intervention mechanism effects in new target populations, taking into account population composition. Together, these contributions are anticipated to optimize targeting of future interventions to prevent drug abuse and addiction.",Mechanisms linking neighborhood poverty to problematic adolescent drug use,9987966,R00DA042127,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Cities ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Drug abuse ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' abuses drugs ', ' Drug Use Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Poverty ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Safety ', ' Schools ', ' Students ', ' Target Populations ', ' Testing ', ' Tweens ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Mediating ', ' base ', ' career ', ' method development ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' residential building ', ' residential site ', ' residence ', ' AOD use ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' using substances ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' bully ', ' bullying ', ' Hour ', ' Techniques ', ' novel ', ' Negotiating ', ' Negotiation ', ' Mediation ', ' mate ', ' Partner in relationship ', ' Prevention ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' boys ', ' girls ', ' Property ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' drug addiction prevention ', ' drug use prevention ', ' prevent drug abuse ', ' prevent drug addiction ', ' prevent drug use ', ' drug abuse prevention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Chemical Dependence ', ' Drug Dependence ', ' Drug Dependency ', ' Drug Addiction ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Subgroup ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Research ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' House Call ', ' home visit ', ' Home visitation ', ' youth drug use ', ' adolescent drug use ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' population based ', ' successful intervention ', ' intervention effect ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' societal costs ', ' ']",NIDA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R00,2020,327835,NY-13,0.054812202795528134
"Technology-Enhanced Family-Focused Treatment for Adolescents at High Risk for Mood Disorders PROJECT SUMMARY  This proposal responds to RFA-MH-17-612, “Pilot Effectiveness Trials for Treatment, Preventive and Services Interventions (R34).” We have shown in several randomized trials that family-focused therapy (FFT) for symptomatic youth at high-risk for bipolar disorder - consisting of psychoeducation and family communication and problem solving skills training - is an effective adjunct to pharmacotherapy in hastening symptomatic recovery. However, between 50%-60% of high-risk youth still have residual mood symptoms and functional impairment after 18 weeks of FFT. In our prior studies, two constructs have emerged as predictors of lack of response to treatment: mood instability in the child and expressed emotion (EE) in parents (i.e., frequent critical comments or hostility). In adolescents (ages 12-18) with a parent with bipolar disorder or major depressive disorder, we hypothesize that augmenting FFT with frequent and targeted interventions in the home setting through a Smartphone app (MyCoachConnect, or MCC) will (a) have a greater and more rapid impact than standard FFT on the targeted mechanisms of mood instability in adolescents and EE in parents, and (b) as a result, enhance symptom resolution and functioning in adolescents. To be eligible, adolescents must score high on parent-rated measures of mood instability, and have at least one parent who is high-EE by speech sample coding criteria. The MCC app will record weekly open speech samples from parents and children and daily and weekly mood ratings from adolescents. The app assessments will be fed back to the FFT clinician, who will use this information to “push” recommendations for mood regulation, communication, and problem-solving strategies (linked to the FFT modules) for parents and youth. In year 1, we will conduct an open trial (n=25) to determine (a) the feasibility and acceptability of FFT with mobile coaching (FFT-MCC), as given by clinicians in community settings, and (b) associations between online/speech feature proxies of the targets (mood instability and EE as measured weekly by MCC) and standard measures of the targets. In years 2 and 3 we will conduct a 75- case RCT in which families are assigned to FFT with MCC skills coaching, FFT with MCC assessments only, with no coaching; or FFT Only, without MCC. We hypothesize that FFT-MCC will be acceptable to parents, adolescents and clinicians, and more effective than FFT without MCC coaching or FFT-Only in engaging the targets of mood instability and EE and promoting improvements in adolescents' mood symptoms and quality of life over 27 weeks. The study will facilitate the translation of a technological augmentation to an evidence-based family intervention, with the goal of increasing treatment access among families with mood disorders. Project Narrative/Relevance We propose to enhance the scalability of family-focused therapy (FFT), a 12-session evidence- based therapy for youth at high risk for mood disorders, through augmentation with a novel mobile phone application called MyCoachConnect (MCC). In adolescents with mood instability who have a parent with bipolar or major depressive disorder, clinicians in community clinics will conduct FFT sessions (consisting of psychoeducation and family skills training) supplemented by weekly MCC “real time” assessments of moods and family relationships; based on results of these assessments and the family's progress in treatment, clinicians will then push personalized informational and coaching alerts regarding the practice of communication and problem-solving skills. We hypothesize that the augmented version of FFT (FFT-MCC) will be more effective than FFT without coaching/informational alerts in altering treatment targets and in stabilizing youths' mood symptoms and quality of life.",Technology-Enhanced Family-Focused Treatment for Adolescents at High Risk for Mood Disorders,9940913,R34MH117200,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Aftercare ', ' After Care ', ' After-Treatment ', ' post treatment ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Anxiety ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Family ', ' Family Relationship ', ' Family Relations ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hostility ', ' Methods ', ' Moods ', ' Persons ', ' Parents ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Recommendation ', ' Sleep ', ' Speech ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' Voice ', ' Measures ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Residual ', ' Residual state ', ' Phase ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' hypomanic ', ' hypomania ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Comment ', ' Commentary ', ' Editorial Comment ', ' Viewpoint ', ' Published Comment ', ' Expressed Emotion ', ' Manias ', ' Manic State ', ' Manic ', ' instrument ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Dimensions ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Reaction ', ' System ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' skills training ', ' treatment planning ', ' Proxy ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Reporting ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' boys ', ' girls ', ' psychoeducation ', ' response ', ' Functional impairment ', ' functional disability ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Enhancement Technology ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Car Phone ', ' Provider ', ' clinical depression ', ' major depression ', ' major depression disorder ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Intake ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Resolution ', ' trial regimen ', ' trial treatment ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' Validation ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' effectiveness trial ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Outcome ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' Affective ', ' usability ', ' volunteer ', ' service intervention ', ' mood regulation ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy design ', ' high risk ', ' community setting ', ' evidence base ', ' primary outcome ', ' standard measure ', ' improve symptom ', ' symptom improvement ', ' symptomatic improvement ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' treatment response ', ' early adulthood ', ' emerging adult ', ' Randomization trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' mobile app ', ' mobile application ', ' improved outcome ', ' mood symptom ', ' Android App ', ' Android Application ', ' Cell Phone Application ', ' Cell phone App ', ' Cellular Phone App ', ' Cellular Phone Application ', ' Smart Phone App ', ' Smart Phone Application ', ' Smartphone App ', ' iOS app ', ' iOS application ', ' iPhone App ', ' iPhone Application ', ' smartphone Application ', ' community clinic ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' Computer Models ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R34,2020,273000,CA-33,0.07472457241018049
"Positive Valence Systems and Manic Symptom Trajectories in Adolescent Depression PROJECT SUMMARY Depression is a heterogeneous condition with varying degrees of severity and different etiologies that contrib- ute to variability in course trajectory and psychosocial functioning. About a third of adolescents with depression exhibit manic symptoms and as such, this substantially increases the risk for psychosocial impairment and sui- cidality. Yet, few studies have examined the pathophysiology of manic symptoms in adolescent depression and how alterations in key neural systems may be associated with changes in emotional, cognitive, and behavioral functioning. This project will address this important gap by employing a dimensional approach and a longitudi- nal design to examine neural, emotional, cognitive, and behavioral substrates of manic symptoms in (non- bipolar) depressed adolescents. Given evidence that manic symptoms implicate dysregulation of emotion and behavior, the current project will test the overarching hypothesis that alterations in connectivity of fronto- striatal-limbic (FSL) circuitry underlying cognitive control of positive emotion and reward and associated altera- tions in RDoC domain-related (emotional, cognitive, behavioral) measures of functioning in Cognitive and Posi- tive Valence Systems could differentiate depressed adolescents with from those without co-occurring manic symptoms. We aim to test this model in a longitudinal study of 180 mid-/post-pubertal adolescents (12-17 years old), including 140 adolescents with clinically significant depressive symptoms varying in manic symp- toms and 40 age- and sex- matched healthy youth. In accordance with the NIMH RDoC initiative, all depressed adolescents will be recruited from treatment settings based on the presence of clinically significant depression symptoms, irrespective of their categorical depressive disorder diagnosis. The project includes at baseline: a) fMRI paradigms measuring functioning of FSL circuitry associated with cognitive control of positive emotion and reward, b) resting state and diffusion tensor imaging, and c) out-of-the scanner neurocognitive tasks (e.g., approach-avoidance). RDoC domain-related emotional (e.g., elated mood), cognitive (e.g., delay discounting), and behavioral (e.g., impulsivity) functioning and levels of arousal will be assessed using a multi-method ap- proach (e.g., computer tasks in the lab and ecologically-valid web-based mood and actigraphy measures) at baseline and repeated bi-annually over 2 years post-scan. In addition, using machine learning algorithms, ex- ploratory analyses will be performed to identify patterns of baseline neuroimaging data and trajectories of RDoC domain-related (emotional, cognitive, behavioral) measures that can predict levels of mood symptoms and functional impairment at 2 years. Findings from this study could help distinguish subgroups of depressed adolescents based on brain-behavioral relationships, improve early detection of manic symptoms in depressed youth, and inform personalized interventions (e.g., antidepressant vs. mood-stabilizer, type of psychotherapy). PROJECT NARRATIVE Early identification of manic symptoms (e.g., impulsive and risk taking behavior, mood lability) and its trajectories can decrease the huge and chronic burden of depressive disorders on youth, families, and society. This pro- posed longitudinal study has the potential to identify neural and behavioral markers of manic symptoms in de- pressed adolescents (without bipolar disorder). Identifying such markers has important clinical implications such as improving early detection of manic symptoms in depressed youth and informing personalized interventions for depression with mixed features (e.g., antidepressant versus mood-stabilizer or tailoring psychotherapeutic ap- proaches).  ",Positive Valence Systems and Manic Symptom Trajectories in Adolescent

"Mechanisms of resilience to developmental stress in children and adolescents. PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT Children and adolescents often grow up in the face of substantial developmental stress (i.e. trauma). While for some, this shifts the developmental trajectory to that of mental and general health disorders, others are resilient. Most research on developmental psychopathology is focused on risk while little is known on the mechanisms that confer resilience. The current study aims to identify biological (genomic, immune), psychological and cognitive mechanisms that underpin resilience in youth as defined by having low mood- anxiety and suicidal outcomes in youth with substantial developmental stress exposure (i.e. trauma and family history of depression). Elucidating resilience mechanisms has huge clinical implications as it will improve stratification of risk to develop depression and/or suicidal behavior, and could identify biological, psychological and cognitive targets that can inform development of future preventive interventions aimed at promoting resilience, reducing the mental and general health adverse outcomes associated with childhood adversity. The study capitalizes on a large dataset of genotyped youths from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC), that have been comprehensively phenotyped for cognitive performance and psychopathology, and that reported substantial trauma exposure. The proposed research integrates genomic and cognitive data with clinical measures used to define resilience in cross sectional analysis of ~9500 PNC youths (Aim 1); incorporates longitudinal data of depression and suicide measures, pulled from electronic medical record in a subset of ~750 PNC youths (Aim 2); and relies on prospective data collection that includes immune profiling of selected PNC individuals to allow identification of immune signature of resilience (Aim 3). Integration of genomic with clinical, cognitive and immune data will allow predictive modeling, and Big Data driven analysis will allow identification of resilience mechanisms. The candidate is a Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist physician scientist who is committed to translational research in youth at risk for psychiatric conditions. His overarching career goal is to develop methods for early identification of subclinical phenotypes before the onset of major psychiatric disorders (i.e. depression and suicide attempts) and, through neuroscience informed interventions, divert the developmental trajectory from that of risk to that of resilience. The career development plan capitalizes on a multidisciplinary mentorship team. It involves one-on one mentoring with the primary “clinical research” mentor as well as the genomic, biostatistical, neurocognitive and immune system expert co- mentors, integrated with hands on research supervision in data collection and statistical analysis, and didactic coursework and workshops. The program is tailored to meet research and training aims. The project will be conducted in the fostering environment of the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and the University of Pennsylvania, that will provide the academic mentorship and the required resources to execute the research and training aims, allowing the candidate to launch an independent research career. PROJECT NARRATIVE Childhood adversities impose risk to general and mental health development, including youth depression and suicidal behavior, still most children are resilient. Through integration of genetic, clinical, cognitive and demographic data from research data and medical records, this study will identify mechanisms that underpin resilience in a generalizable large sample of community youth with substantial exposure to adversity. Understanding resilience mechanisms is a critical milestone on the mission to develop neuroscience informed preventive interventions aimed at promoting resilience and reducing the health burden of

"Development and clinical validation of multimodal risk algorithms for predicting future internalizing psychopathology I am currently Assistant Professor and a licensed clinical psychologist in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Vermont. My long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator using novel strategies in developmental neuroimaging to study mood and anxiety symptomatology from birth to maturity. Although I have been trained in the analysis of longitudinal structural MRI, I require further training in the processing and analysis of state-of-the-art multiband neuroimaging data that allows for more sensitive measures of brain connectivity. I am also lacking expertise with regard to more sophisticated analytic methods for more fully leveraging large-sample multimodal datasets. Such approaches will enable me to move beyond conventional univariate statistical analyses and prepare me for future Big Data initiatives. During the proposed K08 period, my overarching goal is to develop expertise in the application of machine-learning approaches to multimodal data in order to characterize the most salient psychosocial and brain-based predictors of youth internalizing psychopathology. To achieve these goals, I am pursuing career development and training activities in the following areas: 1) assessment and characterization of psychosocial risk factors; 2) theory and implementation of Big Data methods, including machine learning algorithms and cross-validation strategies; 3) analysis of multiband multimodal brain imaging data using Human Connectome Project pipelines with the aim of more comprehensively assessing aspects of cortico-limbic connectivity; 4) independently running my own neuroimaging research study; and 5) developing and submitting a competitive R01 application. In order to obtain this expertise, I am proposing training activities at several institutions, including the University of Vermont, Harvard Medical School, McGill University, and Oregon Health and Science University. The research project in this K08 proposal aims to produce risk algorithms for a transdiagnostic dimension of psychopathology, using novel machine learning approaches to leverage two of the largest longitudinal neuroimaging samples in the world (IMAGEN and the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study). These risk algorithms will subsequently undergo refinement using a new sample of clinic-referred youths that I will recruit from an outpatient psychiatric clinic in Vermont. As part of the project, I will also test the degree to which these algorithms predict treatment response. These data will be used as pilot data for my planned R01 application. Given the methods that I am proposing, this project will be able to detect complex non-linear interactions involving risk factors from a multitude of domains. As a result, this work will inform, and help to delineate, various etiological pathways that ultimately result in internalizing problems. Most importantly, this project could inform early identification and targeted intervention strategies during a critical period for the development of internalizing symptomatology. !
