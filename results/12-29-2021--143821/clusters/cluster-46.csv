"Discovery of Mental Health and Inflammation (MHAIN) Interactome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Knowledge of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is necessary to understand system-level aspects of organisms including that of psychiatric processes. The PPI network (interactome) acts as a vehicle for several types of biomedical research. It can be used to understand the disease mechanisms, drug targets and side effects, and genetic causes for disease. There are 1,014 human genes associated with 'brain'; for 448 of these genes not even a single PPI is known today. While it is useful to discover which pairs of proteins interact, it is also exceptionally challenging as more than 99.9% of protein pairs do not interact. The objective of this work is to carry out systematically designed computational work to discover the human mental health and inflammation (MHAIN) interactome. The MHAIN interactome refers to the network of PPIs where at least one of the two proteins is involved in either brain or inflammation. Many challenges will be addressed in discovering new protein-protein interactions towards building the interactome. Well-established algorithms from diverse computational fields, such as machine learning and signal processing will be applied to achieve the proposed goals. Further, pathways of influence of neuropsychological processes and inflammatory processes on each other will be mined from the interactome. Selected interactions will be validated by wet-lab experiments. The approaches that will be employed for predicting the MHAIN interactome are proactive-learning (to obtain the labels and features of proteins that would provide the maximum impact), transfer-learning (to transfer the knowledge of protein features and interactions from one species to another), multi-sensor fusion (to intelligently integrate output from different predictors). The predicted interactome would accelerate discovery of the biology and treatment of mental health related diseases, by serving as a central resource for biomedical research on mental health. For every protein of interest, verifiable hypothesis of its interactions will be generated that reduce the search space of interactions of that protein from about 25,000 to a few possibilities. New PPIs of proteins involved in major depressive disorder, psychosis in patients with Alzherimer's disease, and systemic inflammation (which is intricately connected to psychiatric diseases), will be put in biomedical context by co- investigators who specialize in these areas. The interactome will identify ""hub-proteins"" that are central to many pathways. It will provide hypothesis of ""functional connectivity"" of new proteins (namely, those of which nothing is currently known). Further, many diseases are found to be untreatable by suppressing a single pathway, and often require manipulating multiple pathways, and the MHAIN interactome can provide the overlap points of multiple pathways that may be used for treatment of diseases. The MHAIN interactome, which would be the outcome of the proposed research, can thus have a broad impact on our understanding of molecular basis of mental health. 1      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research discovers interactions among proteins that are involved in mental health and inflammation.

"Technology-Based Training for Evidence-Based Practice in Mental Health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One important barrier to the successful dissemination of evidence-based practices (EBP) in mental health is the need to train therapists effectively and affordably. To date, the most common training methods in mental health tend to lead to increases in knowledge about EBP but not to skill development or behavior change. The present study will integrate state-of-the art technologies, prior literature on therapist training, and learning theory to develop an accessible and engaging practice component for a traditional online EBP training, with the goal of increasing trainees' skill in a specific EBP in a cost-effective manner. Specifically, the proposed study will have two phases: first, it will first develop a high-quality traditional online training to teach clinicians-in-training how to conduct evidence-based suicide risk assessment. In addition, it will develop an interactive computerized practice client with whom trainees can interact in order to rehearse newly learned concepts and build skill. These training components will be developed in consultation with content and technology experts to ensure the best possible quality of trainings. In its second phase, the present study will test the acceptability and efficacy of the virtual client practice tool by randomly assigning approximately 300 clinicians in training to receive the training as usual, the traditional online training alone, or the traditional online training plus the virtual practice component. It is anticipated that trainees interacting with the practice client will report higher training satisfaction, will show higher training use, and will obtain higher scores on questionnaires and simulations measuring skill in risk assessment than trainees receiving the training as usual or the traditional online training only. Trainees' risk assessment knowledge will also be measured, although no group differences are expected in this domain. The proposed study is a randomized-controlled trial, with measures collected at baseline, post-training, and follow-up (60 days). Trainees who agree to participate will be given access to the study measures (satisfaction, knowledge, and skill) online. Training use will be unobtrusively measured through automated recording of training access data. Planned data analyses will use hierarchical linear regression to predict scores on each study outcome from group status, controlling for training program. Any variables failing a randomization check will also be controlled for. Hierarchical linear modeling will allow for analysis of repeated measures while accounting for the nested structure of the proposed dataset (trainees nested within courses). The proposed study addresses one of the four primary objectives of the NIH: to ""help close the gap between the development of new, research-tested interventions and their wide-spread use by those most in need"" (Strategic Objective 4). The proposed study is also consistent with the goal of this funding mechanism to improve the quality of the training environment. Finally, by developing a potentially cost-effective therapist training tool that can be easily deployed to remote areas, it has the potential to improve the quality of care to underserved populations and contribute to the NIH goal of eliminating health disparities.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Several specific forms of assessment and psychotherapy have been developed for common youth mental health problems, which are both science-based and known to work better than usual assessment and treatments. However, these evidence-based practices are not widely used in community agencies. This is partly because current methods for training therapists are either affordable but do not lead to changes in therapist behavior or client outcomes (e.g., brief workshops), or are effective in changing therapist behavior but are more time, resource, and cost-intensive than most agencies can afford (e.g., adequate ongoing supervision and consultation). The present study will employ advanced but widely available technologies to develop an engaging, affordable, standardized tool for training therapists that offers therapists the opportunity to practice skills repeatedly in a realistic and safe environment where they receive immediate feedback. By establishing the acceptability and feasibility of this tool, the current study has the potential to advance the field's knowledge of how to effectively train therapists in general, and of how to disseminate evidence-based practices to settings where they are most needed. In particular, if successful the proposed training practice tool can easily and affordably be deployed to even remote and rural areas to improve therapist training in those settings. As such, the proposed study could help improve the quality of care received by such typically underserved populations in order to help reduce health disparities. In addition, by applying this tool to a broad and important public health concern such as adolescent suicide risk assessment, the study also has the potential to directly enhance therapists' skill and confidence in conducting state-of-the-science, sensitive risk assessments using empirically grounded strategies, which could, in turn, help them save lives.                Several specific forms of assessment and psychotherapy have been developed for common youth mental health problems, which are both science-based and known to work better than usual assessment and treatments.

"Discovering Tailoring Variables in Childhood Mental Health Treatment Research     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Childhood psychiatric conditions often require that clinicians make individualized treatment decisions. In an exciting trend in child and adolescent mental health (CAMH) research and practice, there is growing interest and awareness in developing individualized decision rules (IDRs). IDRs use sociodemographic information, illness history, comorbidities, family/interpersonal measures, or biomarkers as inputs and then recommend the type, modality, and intensity or delivery of subsequent treatment(s) as outputs. IDRs provide a framework for personalized medicine: the level of personalization increases in proportion to the amount of useful information (tailoring variables) used as inputs in an IDR. The development of IDRs for the treatment of children with mental illness is an important ""next step"" in interventions research. Large scale clinical trials have established efficacious interventions fr many of the common CAMH disorders. However, despite a strong evidence base for treatments that are effective on average, little is known about which children are more or less likely to benefit from one treatment or another. Before IDRs can fulfill their potential, much methodological work remains to be done regarding how to use currently available data to assist in their development. A key step in developing effective IDRs is identifying tailoring variables to use as inputs. Tailoring variables are special types of pre-treatment measures that pinpoint which treatment is best for whom. Existing methods do not explicitly (a) identify which measures are most useful (tailoring variable selection), or (b) combine them in an optimal fashion (tailorin variable feature construction). The specific aims of this study are: Aim 1 (Methods). To develop and evaluate a framework for (a) tailoring variable selection and (b) tailoring variable feature construction for individualizing CAMH treatment. The new method will be used to address scientific questions such as: (a) What are the most important measures (e.g., demographic, severity and duration of illness, comorbidity, parental psychopathology, psychosocial environment including family and peer relationships, biological) to use for tailoring treatment? (b) How do we combine them in order to guide treatment decisions (e.g., individual psychotherapy treatment, medication, or their combination)? Aim 2 (Application): To illustrate and evaluate the method by applying it to the Child/Adolescent Anxiety Multimodal Study randomized trial data to construct an IDR for choosing between SSRI, CBT, or SSRI+CBT for children with anxiety disorders. We will apply the new methodology to identify variables and features pinpointing children who are more or less likely to benefit from SSRI, CBT, or combined SSRI+CBT. Results will be used to construct a proposed IDR for pediatric anxiety disorders. We will compare how average symptom and severity outcomes differ on the IDR vs SSRI for all vs CBT for all vs SSRI+CBT for all.  This study will provide researchers in CAMH with a novel tool for building IDRs. This study has significant public health impact because it aims to develop tools to personalize treatment for children and adolescents with mental health disorders. This is a high-priority area of research for the National Institute of Mental Health.                  PROJEC NARRAIVE: Thspojectaimstodevelopanew too fo decdnghow topesonlze(thatis,indvdulzeo  cusomiz)tramn forchildrnandadolscns ihmnalhalhdisoThrdsrhs.simpotnt cinclandpu-hbeialcthrelevancebecause, althoughrserchhsestbished efccioustretments o mny chldandadolescent mentlhelthdsoders,ltteisknown bout whichchldenaemoeo lsslikly obnfitfrom on ramn oranohr.",Discovering Tailoring Variables in Childhood Mental Health Treatment Research,8359143,R03MH097954,"['Algorithms ', ' Anxiety ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Awareness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' cognitive behavioral treatment ', ' cognitive behavioral therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral modification ', ' cognitive behavioral intervention ', ' cognitive behavior therapy ', ' cognitive behavior modification ', ' cognitive behavior intervention ', ' Cognitive Psychotherapy ', ' Cognition Therapy ', ' Cognitive Therapy ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Dressing ', ' Sterile coverings ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Learning ', ' Medicine ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.) ', ' Parents ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' Psychotherapy ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Work ', ' 1-Naphthalenamine,1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-N-methyl-, (1S-cis)- ', ' Sertraline ', ' Measures ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Guidelines ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Generalized Anxiety Disorder ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' serotonin reuptake inhibitor ', ' Selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor ', ' SSRI ', ' Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Severities ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' psychosocial ', ' interest ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' peer ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Modality ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Property ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Seminal ', ' trend ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Output ', ' Evidence based treatment ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' biomarker ', ' clinical practice ', ' randomized trial ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R03,2012,87008,MI-12,0.06730097136339855

"Technology-Based Training for Evidence-Based Practice in Mental Health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One important barrier to the successful dissemination of evidence-based practices (EBP) in mental health is the need to train therapists effectively and affordably. To date, the most common training methods in mental health tend to lead to increases in knowledge about EBP but not to skill development or behavior change. The present study will integrate state-of-the art technologies, prior literature on therapist training, and learning theory to develop an accessible and engaging practice component for a traditional online EBP training, with the goal of increasing trainees' skill in a specific EBP in a cost-effective manner. Specifically, the proposed study will have two phases: first, it will first develop a high-quality traditional online training to teach clinicians-in-training how to conduct evidence-based suicide risk assessment. In addition, it will develop an interactive computerized practice client with whom trainees can interact in order to rehearse newly learned concepts and build skill. These training components will be developed in consultation with content and technology experts to ensure the best possible quality of trainings. In its second phase, the present study will test the acceptability and efficacy of the virtual client practice tool by randomly assigning approximately 300 clinicians in training to receive the training as usual, the traditional online training alone, or the traditional online training plus the virtual practice component. It is anticipated that trainees interacting with the practice client will report higher training satisfaction, will show higher training use, and will obtain higher scores on questionnaires and simulations measuring skill in risk assessment than trainees receiving the training as usual or the traditional online training only. Trainees' risk assessment knowledge will also be measured, although no group differences are expected in this domain. The proposed study is a randomized-controlled trial, with measures collected at baseline, post-training, and follow-up (60 days). Trainees who agree to participate will be given access to the study measures (satisfaction, knowledge, and skill) online. Training use will be unobtrusively measured through automated recording of training access data. Planned data analyses will use hierarchical linear regression to predict scores on each study outcome from group status, controlling for training program. Any variables failing a randomization check will also be controlled for. Hierarchical linear modeling will allow for analysis of repeated measures while accounting for the nested structure of the proposed dataset (trainees nested within courses). The proposed study addresses one of the four primary objectives of the NIH: to ""help close the gap between the development of new, research-tested interventions and their wide-spread use by those most in need"" (Strategic Objective 4). The proposed study is also consistent with the goal of this funding mechanism to improve the quality of the training environment. Finally, by developing a potentially cost-effective therapist training tool that can be easily deployed to remote areas, it has the potential to improve the quality of care to underserved populations and contribute to the NIH goal of eliminating health disparities.          Several specific forms of assessment and psychotherapy have been developed for common youth mental health problems, which are both science-based and known to work better than usual assessment and treatments. However, these evidence-based practices are not widely used in community agencies. This is partly because current methods for training therapists are either affordable but do not lead to changes in therapist behavior or client outcomes (e.g., brief workshops), or are effective in changing therapist behavior but are more time, resource, and cost-intensive than most agencies can afford (e.g., adequate ongoing supervision and consultation). The present study will employ advanced but widely available technologies to develop an engaging, affordable, standardized tool for training therapists that offers therapists the opportunity to practice skills repeatedly in a realistic and safe environment where they receive immediate feedback. By establishing the acceptability and feasibility of this tool, the current study has the potential to advance the field's knowledge of how to effectively train therapists in general, and of how to disseminate evidence-based practices to settings where they are most needed. In particular, if successful the proposed training practice tool can easily and affordably be deployed to even remote and rural areas to improve therapist training in those settings. As such, the proposed study could help improve the quality of care received by such typically underserved populations in order to help reduce health disparities. In addition, by applying this tool to a broad and important public health concern such as adolescent suicide risk assessment, the study also has the potential to directly enhance therapists' skill and confidence in conducting state-of-the-science, sensitive risk assessments using empirically grounded strategies, which could, in turn, help them save lives.

"Discovering Tailoring Variables in Childhood Mental Health Treatment Research DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Childhood psychiatric conditions often require that clinicians make individualized treatment decisions. In an exciting trend in child and adolescent mental health (CAMH) research and practice, there is growing interest and awareness in developing individualized decision rules (IDRs). IDRs use sociodemographic information, illness history, comorbidities, family/interpersonal measures, or biomarkers as inputs and then recommend the type, modality, and intensity or delivery of subsequent treatment(s) as outputs. IDRs provide a framework for personalized medicine: the level of personalization increases in proportion to the amount of useful information (tailoring variables) used as inputs in an IDR. The development of IDRs for the treatment of children with mental illness is an important ""next step"" in interventions research. Large scale clinical trials have established efficacious interventions fr many of the common CAMH disorders. However, despite a strong evidence base for treatments that are effective on average, little is known about which children are more or less likely to benefit from one treatment or another. Before IDRs can fulfill their potential, much methodological work remains to be done regarding how to use currently available data to assist in their development. A key step in developing effective IDRs is identifying tailoring variables to  use as inputs. Tailoring variables are special types of pre-treatment measures that pinpoint which treatment is best for whom. Existing methods do not explicitly (a) identify which measures are most useful (tailoring variable selection), or (b) combine them in an optimal fashion (tailorin variable feature construction). The specific aims of this study are: Aim 1 (Methods). To develop and evaluate a framework for (a) tailoring variable selection and (b) tailoring variable feature construction for individualizing CAMH treatment. The new method will be used to address scientific questions such as: (a) What are the most important measures (e.g., demographic, severity and duration of illness, comorbidity, parental psychopathology, psychosocial environment including family and peer relationships, biological) to use for tailoring treatment? (b) How do we combine them in order to guide treatment decisions (e.g., individual psychotherapy treatment, medication, or their combination)? Aim 2 (Application): To illustrate and evaluate the method by applying it to the Child/Adolescent Anxiety Multimodal Study randomized trial data to construct an IDR for choosing between SSRI, CBT, or SSRI+CBT for children with anxiety disorders. We will apply the new methodology to identify variables and features pinpointing children who are more or less likely to benefit from SSRI, CBT, or combined SSRI+CBT. Results will be used to construct a proposed IDR for pediatric anxiety disorders. We will compare how average symptom and severity outcomes differ on the IDR vs SSRI for all vs CBT for all vs SSRI+CBT for all. This study will provide researchers in CAMH with a novel tool for building IDRs. This study has significant public health impact because it aims to develop tools to personalize treatment for children and adolescents with mental health disorders. This is a high-priority area of research for the National Institute of Mental Health. This project aims to develop a new tool for deciding how to personalize (that is, individualize or  customize) treatment for children and adolescents with mental health disorders. This has important  clinical and public-health relevance because, although research has established efficacious treatments  for many child and adolescent mental health disorders, little is known about which children are more or  less likely to benefit from one treatment or another.",Discovering Tailoring Variables in Childhood Mental Health Treatment Research,8494094,R03MH097954,"['Algorithms ', ' Anxiety ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Awareness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' cognitive behavioral treatment ', ' cognitive behavioral therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral modification ', ' cognitive behavioral intervention ', ' cognitive behavior therapy ', ' cognitive behavior modification ', ' cognitive behavior intervention ', ' Cognitive Psychotherapy ', ' Cognition Therapy ', ' Cognitive Therapy ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Dressing ', ' Sterile coverings ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Learning ', ' Medicine ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.) ', ' Parents ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' Psychotherapy ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Work ', ' 1-Naphthalenamine,1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-N-methyl-, (1S-cis)- ', ' Sertraline ', ' Measures ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Guidelines ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Generalized Anxiety Disorder ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' serotonin reuptake inhibitor ', ' Selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor ', ' SSRI ', ' Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Severities ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' psychosocial ', ' interest ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' peer ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Modality ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Property ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Seminal ', ' trend ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Output ', ' Evidence based treatment ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' public health relevance ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' clinical practice ', ' randomized trial ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R03,2013,79358,MI-12,0.07239502264948201
"Real-Time Mobile Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Serious Mental Illness     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project responds to RFA MH 13-260 ""Harnessing Advanced Health Technologies to Drive Mental Health Improvement,"" and is led by a New/Early Stage Investigator. Bipolar disorder (BD) and Schizophrenia (SZ) are leading causes of disability and are the costliest disorders to treat among serious mental illnesses. Ample evidence exists that evidence-based psychotherapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) produce clinically significant improvements in symptoms of BD and SZ, and yet only 5% of patients in the community can access these treatments. Access to CBT for serious mental illnesses is limited by the restricted pool of trained providers, the resource intensity of these treatments, and cessation of reimbursement for psychological services in many public mental health systems. Our research in BD and SZ over the past five years indicates that mobile phones can provide automated yet personalized cognitive behavioral intervention that is feasible, acceptable, and associated with improvements in symptoms, medication adherence and socialization. Our intervention, called CBT2go, integrates ecological momentary assessment with personalized interventions delivered in the moment that symptoms and related experiences occur. We have developed an innovative platform that functions on various screen types, operating system, or data access technologies, and we have begun to incorporate innovative features into CBT2go, including location-based data and personalized predictive modeling, that can potentially lead to transformative mobile interventions. We propose a research study with the overarching aims of evaluating the effectiveness of CBT2go, gathering necessary data to refine its innovative features, and examining its costs, facilitators, and barries to implementation in a public mental health system. We propose a randomized controlled trial with three arms: 1) CBT2go, 2) an ecological momentary assessment only condition to control for self-monitoring and device contact, and 3) standard care. A total of 255 participants with either BD or SZ will be recruited from a large public mental health system that has minimal access to CBT. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 6 weeks (mid-treatment), 12 weeks (post-treatment) and 24 weeks (follow-up). The primary outcome of the study will be clinician rated global psychopathology, and secondary outcomes will include medication adherence, social functioning, and mental health service utilization. Recognizing that not all participants wil benefit, we propose to examine differential effectiveness in sub-groups. We will also examine mechanisms of change to inform mobile intervention design, focusing on the impact of CBT2go on cognitive insight and dysfunctional attitudes, which are two mediators of change in traditionally delivered CBT. Drawing from experience in implementation research, we will employ a mixed methods approach to assessing the facilitators, barriers, and costs of adoption of CBT2go from perspectives of consumers, technology experts, administrators and front-line clinicians. This study will lay the groundwork for CBT2go to be adapted and implemented with high fidelity in healthcare settings.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bipolar disorder and schizophrenia are two of the most disabling and costly mental health problems, and few people with these illnesses in the community have access to evidence-based psychological interventions that improve outcomes like symptoms and medication adherence. We have developed, and propose to evaluate, new technology for delivering personalized real-time interventions to people with serious mental illnesses that bypasses current barriers to accessing psychological treatments. If effective, this intervention could help to improve the mental health of people with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia in a variety of treatment settings.                ",Real-Time Mobile

"Innovative Use of the Noom Monitor Mobile Application for CBT-GSH in Binge Eaters     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder are marked by significant levels of impairment and psychiatric comorbidity, affecting approximately 5-7% of the US population. Guided self-help cognitive behavioral (CBT-GSH) therapy has been show to be an effective treatment to reduce binge eating for patient with both disorders. However, there is limited uptake among both clients and therapists. One significant factor is self-monitoring, the central component of cognitive- behavioral therapy, which is both time-intensive and cumbersome in its traditional paper format for clients, as well as difficult to comprehensively address in a time-limited session for the therapist. This grant proposes to utilize emerging mobile application technology, as a tool for increasing the potency, accessibility, and efficacy of guided self-help. This will be accomplished by adapting WorkSmart Lab's current commercial mobile product for healthy eating and exercise, Noom Monitor, into a self-monitoring application integrating CBT-GSH tools for binge eaters. Additionally, the application will be used to facilitate real-time feedback to therapists about their patient progres. Therapists will be notified in real-time about any drastic changes in client eating patterns through pre-set alerts designed to assign a grade to therapists, representing each client's well-being. The feasibility and efficacy of the adapted Noom Monitor application will be examined through a randomized control trial comparing CBT-GSH + APP with CBT-GSH conducted at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine's Eating and Weight Disorders Program. The innovative utilization of technology to assist in mental health interventions has widespread implications outside of this proposal, which will be used to strategize the further development and commercialization of this product.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Guided self-help cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT-GSH) has been shown to be a cost-effective and efficacious treatment for BN and BED, but has limited uptake among both clients and therapists, partly due to the time-intensive and cumbersome nature of the primary CBT-GSH intervention, self-monitoring. This grant proposes to utilize a mobile application, Noom Monitor, to reduce the burden of self-monitoring and provide real-time feedback to therapists, to enhance both therapist and client uptake of CBT-GSH. The findings from this grant has widespread implications for public health, as the use of mobile applications to strengthen treatment adherence and augment existing interventions has enormous potential for use within both mental and medical health care service delivery models.            ",Innovative Use of the Noom Monitor Mobile Application for CBT-GSH in Binge Eaters,8521678,R41MH096435,"['Affect ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' bulimic ', ' Bulimia Nervosa ', ' Bulimia ', ' Client ', ' cognitive behavioral treatment ', ' cognitive behavioral therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral modification ', ' cognitive behavioral intervention ', ' cognitive behavior therapy ', ' cognitive behavior modification ', ' cognitive behavior intervention ', ' Cognitive Psychotherapy ', ' Cognition Therapy ', ' Cognitive Therapy ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Dropout ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating ', ' Physical Exercise ', ' Exercise ', ' Feedback ', ' Grant ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' Paper ', ' Patients ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Psychotherapy ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Intention ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' Individual ', ' uptake ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' programs ', ' Notification ', ' compulsive overeating ', ' compulsive feeding ', ' compulsive eating ', ' Binge Eating ', ' calorie (nutrition) ', ' Calories ', ' Side ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' interest ', ' Binge eating disorder ', ' self help ', ' health record ', ' payment ', ' purging ', ' purge ', ' Modeling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' weight management ', ' weight control ', ' Weight maintenance regimen ', ' outreach to information ', ' Access to Information ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Car Phone ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Adherence ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Data ', ' dietary pattern ', ' Dietary Practices ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Cognitive ', ' Monitor ', ' Text ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' trial comparing ', ' commercialization ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' treatment adherence ', ' phase II study ', ' phase 2 study ', ' Secure ', ' ']",NIMH,"NOOM, INC.",R41,2013,343684,NY-12,0.036894365450971134
"Discovery of Mental Health and Inflammation (MHAIN) Interactome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Knowledge of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is necessary to understand system-level aspects of organisms including that of psychiatric processes. The PPI network (interactome) acts as a vehicle for several types of biomedical research. It can be used to understand the disease mechanisms, drug targets and side effects, and genetic causes for disease. There are 1,014 human genes associated with 'brain'; for 448 of these genes not even a single PPI is known today. While it is useful to discover which pairs of proteins interact, it is also exceptionally challenging as more than 99.9% of protein pairs do not interact. The objective of this work is to carry out systematically designed computational work to discover the human mental health and inflammation (MHAIN) interactome. The MHAIN interactome refers to the network of PPIs where at least one of the two proteins is involved in either brain or inflammation. Many challenges will be addressed in discovering new protein-protein interactions towards building the interactome. Well-established algorithms from diverse computational fields, such as machine learning and signal processing will be applied to achieve the proposed goals. Further, pathways of influence of neuropsychological processes and inflammatory processes on each other will be mined from the interactome. Selected interactions will be validated by wet-lab experiments. The approaches that will be employed for predicting the MHAIN interactome are proactive-learning (to obtain the labels and features of proteins that would provide the maximum impact), transfer-learning (to transfer the knowledge of protein features and interactions from one species to another), multi-sensor fusion (to intelligently integrate output from different predictors). The predicted interactome would accelerate discovery of the biology and treatment of mental health related diseases, by serving as a central resource for biomedical research on mental health. For every protein of interest, verifiable hypothesis of its interactions will be generated that reduce the search space of interactions of that protein from about 25,000 to a few possibilities. New PPIs of proteins involved in major depressive disorder, psychosis in patients with Alzherimer's disease, and systemic inflammation (which is intricately connected to psychiatric diseases), will be put in biomedical context by co- investigators who specialize in these areas. The interactome will identify ""hub-proteins"" that are central to many pathways. It will provide hypothesis of ""functional connectivity"" of new proteins (namely, those of which nothing is currently known). Further, many diseases are found to be untreatable by suppressing a single pathway, and often require manipulating multiple pathways, and the MHAIN interactome can provide the overlap points of multiple pathways that may be used for treatment of diseases. The MHAIN interactome, which would be the outcome of the proposed research, can thus have a broad impact on our understanding of molecular basis of mental health. 1        The proposed research discovers interactions among proteins that are involved in mental health and inflammation. The knowledge of such interactions would generate hypotheses about the role of these proteins in biological functional pathways and would contribute towards the understanding of the biology of diseases and towards development of mechanisms of treatment.

"Real-Time Mobile Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Serious Mental Illness     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project responds to RFA MH 13-260 ""Harnessing Advanced Health Technologies to Drive Mental Health Improvement,"" and is led by a New/Early Stage Investigator. Bipolar disorder (BD) and Schizophrenia (SZ) are leading causes of disability and are the costliest disorders to treat among serious mental illnesses. Ample evidence exists that evidence-based psychotherapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) produce clinically significant improvements in symptoms of BD and SZ, and yet only 5% of patients in the community can access these treatments. Access to CBT for serious mental illnesses is limited by the restricted pool of trained providers, the resource intensity of these treatments, and cessation of reimbursement for psychological services in many public mental health systems. Our research in BD and SZ over the past five years indicates that mobile phones can provide automated yet personalized cognitive behavioral intervention that is feasible, acceptable, and associated with improvements in symptoms, medication adherence and socialization. Our intervention, called CBT2go, integrates ecological momentary assessment with personalized interventions delivered in the moment that symptoms and related experiences occur. We have developed an innovative platform that functions on various screen types, operating system, or data access technologies, and we have begun to incorporate innovative features into CBT2go, including location-based data and personalized predictive modeling, that can potentially lead to transformative mobile interventions. We propose a research study with the overarching aims of evaluating the effectiveness of CBT2go, gathering necessary data to refine its innovative features, and examining its costs, facilitators, and barries to implementation in a public mental health system. We propose a randomized controlled trial with three arms: 1) CBT2go, 2) an ecological momentary assessment only condition to control for self-monitoring and device contact, and 3) standard care. A total of 255 participants with either BD or SZ will be recruited from a large public mental health system that has minimal access to CBT. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 6 weeks (mid-treatment), 12 weeks (post-treatment) and 24 weeks (follow-up). The primary outcome of the study will be clinician rated global psychopathology, and secondary outcomes will include medication adherence, social functioning, and mental health service utilization. Recognizing that not all participants wil benefit, we propose to examine differential effectiveness in sub-groups. We will also examine mechanisms of change to inform mobile intervention design, focusing on the impact of CBT2go on cognitive insight and dysfunctional attitudes, which are two mediators of change in traditionally delivered CBT. Drawing from experience in implementation research, we will employ a mixed methods approach to assessing the facilitators, barriers, and costs of adoption of CBT2go from perspectives of consumers, technology experts, administrators and front-line clinicians. This study will lay the groundwork for CBT2go to be adapted and implemented with high fidelity in healthcare settings.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bipolar disorder and schizophrenia are two of the most disabling and costly mental health problems, and few people with these illnesses in the community have access to evidence-based psychological interventions that improve outcomes like symptoms and medication adherence. We have developed, and propose to evaluate, new technology for delivering personalized real-time interventions to people with serious mental illnesses that bypasses current barriers to accessing psychological treatments. If effective, this intervention could help to improve the mental health of people with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia in a variety of treatment settings.                ",Real-Time Mobile

"Discovery of Mental Health and Inflammation (MHAIN) Interactome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Knowledge of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is necessary to understand system-level aspects of organisms including that of psychiatric processes. The PPI network (interactome) acts as a vehicle for several types of biomedical research. It can be used to understand the disease mechanisms, drug targets and side effects, and genetic causes for disease. There are 1,014 human genes associated with 'brain'; for 448 of these genes not even a single PPI is known today. While it is useful to discover which pairs of proteins interact, it is also exceptionally challenging as more than 99.9% of protein pairs do not interact. The objective of this work is to carry out systematically designed computational work to discover the human mental health and inflammation (MHAIN) interactome. The MHAIN interactome refers to the network of PPIs where at least one of the two proteins is involved in either brain or inflammation. Many challenges will be addressed in discovering new protein-protein interactions towards building the interactome. Well-established algorithms from diverse computational fields, such as machine learning and signal processing will be applied to achieve the proposed goals. Further, pathways of influence of neuropsychological processes and inflammatory processes on each other will be mined from the interactome. Selected interactions will be validated by wet-lab experiments. The approaches that will be employed for predicting the MHAIN interactome are proactive-learning (to obtain the labels and features of proteins that would provide the maximum impact), transfer-learning (to transfer the knowledge of protein features and interactions from one species to another), multi-sensor fusion (to intelligently integrate output from different predictors). The predicted interactome would accelerate discovery of the biology and treatment of mental health related diseases, by serving as a central resource for biomedical research on mental health. For every protein of interest, verifiable hypothesis of its interactions will be generated that reduce the search space of interactions of that protein from about 25,000 to a few possibilities. New PPIs of proteins involved in major depressive disorder, psychosis in patients with Alzherimer's disease, and systemic inflammation (which is intricately connected to psychiatric diseases), will be put in biomedical context by co- investigators who specialize in these areas. The interactome will identify ""hub-proteins"" that are central to many pathways. It will provide hypothesis of ""functional connectivity"" of new proteins (namely, those of which nothing is currently known). Further, many diseases are found to be untreatable by suppressing a single pathway, and often require manipulating multiple pathways, and the MHAIN interactome can provide the overlap points of multiple pathways that may be used for treatment of diseases. The MHAIN interactome, which would be the outcome of the proposed research, can thus have a broad impact on our understanding of molecular basis of mental health. 1        The proposed research discovers interactions among proteins that are involved in mental health and inflammation. The knowledge of such interactions would generate hypotheses about the role of these proteins in biological functional pathways and would contribute towards the understanding of the biology of diseases and towards development of mechanisms of treatment.

"Innovative Use of the Noom Monitor Mobile Application for CBT-GSH in Binge Eaters     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder are marked by significant levels of impairment and psychiatric comorbidity, affecting approximately 5-7% of the US population. Guided self-help cognitive behavioral (CBT-GSH) therapy has been show to be an effective treatment to reduce binge eating for patient with both disorders. However, there is limited uptake among both clients and therapists. One significant factor is self-monitoring, the central component of cognitive- behavioral therapy, which is both time-intensive and cumbersome in its traditional paper format for clients, as well as difficult to comprehensively address in a time-limited session for the therapist. This grant proposes to utilize emerging mobile application technology, as a tool for increasing the potency, accessibility, and efficacy of guided self-help. This will be accomplished by adapting WorkSmart Lab's current commercial mobile product for healthy eating and exercise, Noom Monitor, into a self-monitoring application integrating CBT-GSH tools for binge eaters. Additionally, the application will be used to facilitate real-time feedback to therapists about their patient progres. Therapists will be notified in real-time about any drastic changes in client eating patterns through pre-set alerts designed to assign a grade to therapists, representing each client's well-being. The feasibility and efficacy of the adapted Noom Monitor application will be examined through a randomized control trial comparing CBT-GSH + APP with CBT-GSH conducted at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine's Eating and Weight Disorders Program. The innovative utilization of technology to assist in mental health interventions has widespread implications outside of this proposal, which will be used to strategize the further development and commercialization of this product.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Guided self-help cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT-GSH) has been shown to be a cost-effective and efficacious treatment for BN and BED, but has limited uptake among both clients and therapists, partly due to the time-intensive and cumbersome nature of the primary CBT-GSH intervention, self-monitoring. This grant proposes to utilize a mobile application, Noom Monitor, to reduce the burden of self-monitoring and provide real-time feedback to therapists, to enhance both therapist and client uptake of CBT-GSH. The findings from this grant has widespread implications for public health, as the use of mobile applications to strengthen treatment adherence and augment existing interventions has enormous potential for use within both mental and medical health care service delivery models.            ",Innovative Use of the Noom Monitor Mobile Application for CBT-GSH in Binge Eaters,8665495,R41MH096435,"['Affect ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' bulimic ', ' Bulimia Nervosa ', ' Bulimia ', ' Client ', ' cognitive behavioral treatment ', ' cognitive behavioral therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral modification ', ' cognitive behavioral intervention ', ' cognitive behavior therapy ', ' cognitive behavior modification ', ' cognitive behavior intervention ', ' Cognitive Psychotherapy ', ' Cognition Therapy ', ' Cognitive Therapy ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Dropout ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating ', ' Physical Exercise ', ' Exercise ', ' Feedback ', ' Grant ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' Paper ', ' Patients ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Psychotherapy ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Intention ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' Individual ', ' uptake ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' programs ', ' Notification ', ' compulsive overeating ', ' compulsive feeding ', ' compulsive eating ', ' Binge Eating ', ' calorie (nutrition) ', ' Calories ', ' Side ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' interest ', ' Binge eating disorder ', ' self help ', ' health record ', ' payment ', ' purging ', ' purge ', ' Modeling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' weight management ', ' weight control ', ' Weight maintenance regimen ', ' outreach to information ', ' Access to Information ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Car Phone ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Adherence ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Data ', ' dietary pattern ', ' Dietary Practices ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Cognitive ', ' Monitor ', ' Text ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' trial comparing ', ' commercialization ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' treatment adherence ', ' phase II study ', ' phase 2 study ', ' Secure ', ' mobile app ', ' mobile application ', ' ']",NIMH,"NOOM, INC.",R41,2014,330324,NY-12,0.036894365450971134

"ANALYSIS OF NONSTATIONARY NEURAL DATA ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Much mental health research uses neurophysiological measurements to describe the way neural activity within and across brain regions is related to behavioral function and dysfunction. One kind of signal, known as spike trains, comes from individual neurons. Other signals, including local field potentials (LFPs), electroencephalography (EEGs), and magnetoencephalography (MEG) are based on activity from large numbers of neurons within specified parts of the brain. With all of these sources of data, scientifically rigorous statistical analysis must accommodate unstable fluctuations, associated with movement or thought, known in statistics as non-stationary. The continuing research program of this grant is to develop methods for analyzing non-stationary neural data. The number of neural signals that can be recorded simultaneously has been increasing rapidly. Because neural network dysfunction is widely considered to be associated with psychopathology, improvements in recording technologies offer exciting opportunities. They also create big statistical challenges due to greatly increased complexity. The research in this grant aims to provide methods for analyzing the ways that network structure may change with particular variables, including those that help characterize behavior, which involves the transmission of neural information at multiple timescales. Fast timescales include oscillations and neural synchrony, which could provide an essential mechanism of neural network information flow and may be a marker that distinguishes normal from diseased states. At slower timescales there is considerable redundancy in the recorded signals, which suggests dimensionality reduction. New methods investigated in this research program can accommodate both faster and slower timescales, and they can also accommodate relationships arising from the spatial configuration of electrodes that record neural signals. These methods are tailored to handle spike trains, LFP, and MEG data, especially as they might arise in experiments related to mental health research. Because a neural spike train is a set of times at which a neuron fired, it is common to consider it to be a point process, which is the statistical model set up to handle sequences of event times.

"Statistical Methods for Neural Mechanisms Mediating Cognitive System in Mental Health Research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Psychiatric disorders, as well as normal aging, are often associated with a wide range of cognitive changes. Recent developments in neuroscience, particularly multimodal neuroimaging techniques, can provide better understanding of neural mechanisms that underlie these changes. Mediation analysis is a popularly used statistical method to investigate neural mechanisms. However, existing statistical methods were not designed to accommodate such large-scale, multi-dimensional, and complicated data in mediation analysis. The overarching aim of my K01 Mentored Research Development Award is to acquire training that will allow me to pursue a line of mental health research related to cognition and to develop novel statistical methods to support the emerging research in cognitive neuroimaging and mental health. I propose to receive training in: 1) cognition and its relationship with aging and psychopathology; 2) neural basis in cognition and multimodal neuroimaging; 3) functional mediation and selective mediation analysis. This will provide me with the tools to conduct research that will fill significant gaps in the statistical analyses on cognitive neuroimaging, particularly focusing on aging and neurodegeneration-associated cognitive decline: First, I propose to review and develop analytic tools to examine how aging and psychopathology affect cognitive system constructs. Understanding the patterns of age-related differences in each of these cognitive constructs and the possible heterogeneity related to the psychopathology is of great importance. I will test nonlinearity and heterogeneity in the latent cognitive constructs using two independent large data. Second, I will develop and examine activation networks (reference ability neural networks (RANNs)) associated with each of the cognitive constructs. Although it is critical to understand underlying neural networks of cognition, there are many unsolved problems in investigating the presence or structure of RANNs. I will develop a method to derive underlying networks, find RANNs taking into account possible spatial overlap among RANNs, and investigate the relationship between RANNs expression and performance on the concomitant cognitive constructs. Third, I will develop selective mediation analyses to examine the relationship between imaged neural substrates of aging and psychiatric disorder, such as regional volume loss, and cognitive decline and test if the different imaged brain modalities selectively mediate cognitive aging by influencing the expression of cognitive ability constructs. In totality, this training and research will inform hypotheses for an R01 grant application to be submitted in Year 4 of the award period. While to date I have exemplified a productive research career in biostatistics and psychiatry, I need substantially more training for successful completion of the research proposed in this application and to make a lasting contribution to the field of mental health.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The present application develops new statistical methods to examine neural mechanisms in the context of cognitive system constructs. The training and research proposed here will form the basis for developing a new line of statistical methods to identify functional neural mechanisms related to cognitive constructs and examine the role of brain in cognitive changes associated with psychiatric disorders. These inquires have substantial promise for mental health; accurate identification of functional and structural neural system and their mechanisms is crucial to better understanding mental illness and developing new treatments.             ",Statistical Methods for Neural Mechanisms Mediating Cognitive System in Mental Health Research,8951241,K01AG051348,"['Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Award ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Cognition ', ' cognitive syndrome ', ' cognitive disorder ', ' cognitive disease ', ' Cognition Disorders ', ' Data Sources ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Pathology ', ' Psychiatry ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' Research ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' research and development ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Testing ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' career ', ' method development ', ' brain visualization ', ' Brain imaging ', ' Training ', ' cortical atrophy ', ' brain atrophy ', ' cerebral atrophy ', ' Measurement ', ' Multicenter Studies ', ' liquid ', ' fluid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' tool ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' age related memory dysfunction ', ' age related cognitive impairment ', ' age related cognitive deficit ', ' age associated memory decline ', ' Benign senescent forgetfulness ', ' Age-related cognitive decline ', ' Age-associated cognitive decline ', ' Age-associated memory impairment ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Episodic memory ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Performance ', ' neural network ', ' Biological Neural Networks ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Speed ', ' Speed (motion) ', ' Structure ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Mediation ', ' Modality ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' brain volume ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' cognitive change ', ' Data ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Research Training ', ' Cognitive ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' aging effect ', ' age effect ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' pathological aging ', ' Cognitive aging ', ' neural mechanism ', ' neuromechanism ', ' cognitive system ', ' normal aging ', ' public health relevance ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' ']",NIA,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,K01,2015,131400,NY-13,0.1291389837459395
"Real-Time Mobile Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Serious Mental Illness DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project responds to RFA MH 13-260 ""Harnessing Advanced Health Technologies to Drive Mental Health Improvement,"" and is led by a New/Early Stage Investigator. Bipolar disorder (BD) and Schizophrenia (SZ) are leading causes of disability and are the costliest disorders to treat among serious mental illnesses. Ample evidence exists that evidence-based psychotherapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) produce clinically significant improvements in symptoms of BD and SZ, and yet only 5% of patients in the community can access these treatments. Access to CBT for serious mental illnesses is limited by the restricted pool of trained providers, the resource intensity of these treatments, and cessation of reimbursement for psychological services in many public mental health systems. Our research in BD and SZ over the past five years indicates that mobile phones can provide automated yet personalized cognitive behavioral intervention that is feasible, acceptable, and associated with improvements in symptoms, medication adherence and socialization. Our intervention, called CBT2go, integrates ecological momentary assessment with personalized interventions delivered in the moment that symptoms and related experiences occur. We have developed an innovative platform that functions on various screen types, operating system, or data access technologies, and we have begun to incorporate innovative features into CBT2go, including location-based data and personalized predictive modeling, that can potentially lead to transformative mobile interventions. We propose a research study with the overarching aims of evaluating the effectiveness of CBT2go, gathering necessary data to refine its innovative features, and examining its costs, facilitators, and barries to implementation in a public mental health system. We propose a randomized controlled trial with three arms: 1) CBT2go, 2) an ecological momentary assessment only condition to control for self-monitoring and device contact, and 3) standard care. A total of 255 participants with either BD or SZ will be recruited from a large public mental health system that has minimal access to CBT. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 6 weeks (mid-treatment), 12 weeks (post-treatment) and 24 weeks (follow-up). The primary outcome of the study will be clinician rated global psychopathology, and secondary outcomes will include medication adherence, social functioning, and mental health service utilization. Recognizing that not all participants wil benefit, we propose to examine differential effectiveness in sub-groups. We will also examine mechanisms of change to inform mobile intervention design, focusing on the impact of CBT2go on cognitive insight and dysfunctional attitudes, which are two mediators of change in traditionally delivered CBT. Drawing from experience in implementation research, we will employ a mixed methods approach to assessing the facilitators, barriers, and costs of adoption of CBT2go from perspectives of consumers, technology experts, administrators and front-line clinicians. This study will lay the groundwork for CBT2go to be adapted and implemented with high fidelity in healthcare settings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bipolar disorder and schizophrenia are two of the most disabling and costly mental health problems, and few people with these illnesses in the community have access to evidence-based psychological interventions that improve outcomes like symptoms and medication adherence. We have developed, and propose to evaluate, new technology for delivering personalized real-time interventions to people with serious mental illnesses that bypasses current barriers to accessing psychological treatments. If effective, this intervention could help to improve the mental health of people with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia in a variety of treatment settings.",Real-Time Mobile Cognitive Behavioral

"A Common Framework for ""Big Data"" Mental Health Research on Twitter ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The last decade has seen explosive growth of online social networks (OSNs), which are now a pervasive part of everyday life for many people. ""Big data"" analyses of OSNs have enormous potential to enable new discoveries and applications in public health. For example we may soon be able to study how mental health indicators vary over time and between communities and regions; how major events like disasters and mass shootings affect community mental health; and potentially even use social media for individual-level screening and diagnosis. But in order to do this effectively, psychologists need to know how to make sense of vast amounts of digital records of raw behavior. That will require interdisciplinary collaborations between psychology and computer science to create new tools and methods for automated analyses of mental health variables in large and complex datasets. The goal of this project is to develop new metrics for doing large-scale, ""big data"" mental health research on Twitter, a popular online social network service with a large and diverse user base in the United States that makes most user-generated content publicly available. We are particularly interested in how Twitter data can be used to draw inferences about users' personality traits (which are indicative of risk and vulnerability), emotions, and clinical symptoms. To date, researchers studying mental health on Twitter have focused on a small number of metrics which often differ from study to study and are not always well-validated. We do not yet have a unified, comprehensive understanding of how mental health characteristics can be measured and studied online. Our project has three goals. First, we will gather data from a very large, representative sample of American Twitter users to map out what meaningful metrics can be derived from Twitter data. What can be reliably measured, and how are different kinds of metrics related to each other? By studying relationships and overlaps among these variables, we expect to identify a key set of online metrics that can be used to characterize important psychological differences among users. Second, we will recruit a sample of Twitter users to complete standardized assessments of personality, emotion, and clinical symptoms. We will look to see what kinds of online behaviors are reliable and valid markers of these psychological variables. Third, to demonstrate the utility of these markers we will monitor millions of Twitter accounts around the country for one year to measure how one specific kind of community trauma, mass shootings, affects indicators of personality, emotion, and mental health. We expect to find effects of such events on the online expression of emotion and clinical symptoms immediately following an event, and perhaps longer-term effects that endure beyond the immediate aftermath.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will allow us to identify important markers of personality, emotion, and mental health in Twitter data. This will be useful to researchers who want to use ""big data"" approaches to study mental health, and to policy applications to study individual or regional variations and reactions to events.            ","A Common Framework for ""Big Data"" Mental Health Research on Twitter",8873743,R21MH106879,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anxiety ', ' Behavior ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Collection ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Dictionary ', ' Disasters ', ' Emotions ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Linguistic ', ' Linguistics ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Maps ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Structural Models ', ' Personality ', ' Personality Assessment ', ' Psychologist ', ' Psychology ', ' Psychometrics ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Records ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Friends ', ' Measures ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' specimen collection ', ' sample collection ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Link ', ' Personality Traits ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Reaction ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Country ', ' expression of emotion ', ' emotional expression ', ' showing emotion ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' transdisciplinary collaboration ', ' interdisciplinary collaboration ', ' computer science ', ' member ', ' Categories ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' study characteristics ', ' digital ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Trauma ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' public health relevance ', ' online social networking ', ' web-based social networking ', ' posttraumatic stress ', ' post-traumatic stress ', ' screening ', ' Big Data ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R21,2015,203059,OR-04,0.16704603697185685
"Discovery of Mental Health and Inflammation (MHAIN) Interactome DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Knowledge of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is necessary to understand system-level aspects of organisms including that of psychiatric processes. The PPI network (interactome) acts as a vehicle for several types of biomedical research. It can be used to understand the disease mechanisms, drug targets and side effects, and genetic causes for disease. There are 1,014 human genes associated with 'brain'; for 448 of these genes not even a single PPI is known today. While it is useful to discover which pairs of proteins interact, it is also exceptionally challenging as more than 99.9% of protein pairs do not interact. The objective of this work is to carry out systematically designed computational work to discover the human mental health and inflammation (MHAIN) interactome. The MHAIN interactome refers to the network of PPIs where at least one of the two proteins is involved in either brain or inflammation. Many challenges will be addressed in discovering new protein-protein interactions towards building the interactome. Well-established algorithms from diverse computational fields, such as machine learning and signal processing will be applied to achieve the proposed goals. Further, pathways of influence of neuropsychological processes and inflammatory processes on each other will be mined from the interactome. Selected interactions will be validated by wet-lab experiments. The approaches that will be employed for predicting the MHAIN interactome are proactive-learning (to obtain the labels and features of proteins that would provide the maximum impact), transfer-learning (to transfer the knowledge of protein features and interactions from one species to another), multi-sensor fusion (to intelligently integrate output from different predictors). The predicted interactome would accelerate discovery of the biology and treatment of mental health related diseases, by serving as a central resource for biomedical research on mental health. For every protein of interest, verifiable hypothesis of its interactions will be generated that reduce the search space of interactions of that protein from about 25,000 to a few possibilities. New PPIs of proteins involved in major depressive disorder, psychosis in patients with Alzherimer's disease, and systemic inflammation (which is intricately connected to psychiatric diseases), will be put in biomedical context by co- investigators who specialize in these areas. The interactome will identify ""hub-proteins"" that are central to many pathways. It will provide hypothesis of ""functional connectivity"" of new proteins (namely, those of which nothing is currently known). Further, many diseases are found to be untreatable by suppressing a single pathway, and often require manipulating multiple pathways, and the MHAIN interactome can provide the overlap points of multiple pathways that may be used for treatment of diseases. The MHAIN interactome, which would be the outcome of the proposed research, can thus have a broad impact on our understanding of molecular basis of mental health. 1 The proposed research discovers interactions among proteins that are involved in mental health and inflammation. The knowledge of such interactions would generate hypotheses about the role of these proteins in biological functional pathways and would contribute towards the understanding of the biology of diseases and towards development of mechanisms of treatment.",Discovery of Mental Health and Inflammation (MHAIN) Interactome,8841004,R01MH094564,"['Algorithms ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Anxiety ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' autophagy ', ' Autophagocytosis ', ' Behavior ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Biology ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' positive attitude ', ' Happiness ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Immunity ', ' Infection ', ' Inflammation ', ' Information Networks ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Mining ', ' insular sclerosis ', ' MS (Multiple Sclerosis) ', ' Disseminated Sclerosis ', ' Multiple Sclerosis ', ' living system ', ' Organism ', ' Panic ', ' Patients ', ' Physiologic Processes ', ' Organismal Process ', ' Organism-Level Process ', ' Physiological Processes ', ' gene product ', ' Proteins ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Psychological Side Effects ', ' psychotic illness ', ' Psychoses ', ' Psychotic Disorders ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Psychologic Stress ', ' Psychological Stress ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Thinking, function ', ' training transfer ', ' learning transfer ', ' Transfer (Psychology) ', ' Psychological Transfer ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' virus infection ', ' viral infection ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' Work ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' sensor ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' insight ', ' Genetic ', ' Inflammatory ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Systemic disease ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' environmental stressor ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' body-mind ', ' response ', ' protein protein interaction ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Adverse effects ', ' Inflammatory Response ', ' major depression ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' Address ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Data ', ' Viral Cancer ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Output ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Mind ', ' brain behavior ', ' neuropsychological ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' signal processing ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2015,357427,PA-18,0.2253997658625406
"Scaling a smarter and more efficient intervention: Evaluating the feasibility of disseminating a novel mobile app platform to treat depression ABSTRACT The goal of this project is to conduct a pilot study to test the utility of a Natural Language Processing (NLP) clinical messaging tool to improve the reach and the quality (fidelity and competency) of coaches providing behavioral activation (BA) strategies through a mobile mental health app called Personalized Real-time Intervention for Motivational Enhancement (PRIME). Despite decades of research and development for the treatment of mood disorders, depression has risen from the 5th leading cause of disability to the leading cause in the US. Critical barriers for progress in the field are 1) Poor access to high quality care for consumers; 2) Limited mental health workforce; and 3) Few providers are trained in the delivery of evidence-based treatments. In response to this public health problem, our team is proposing to use a mobile platform to improve access to an evidence based treatment; increase the reach of mental health coaches while supporting the delivery of higher quality of care. We will improve the reach of clinicians by using a NLP-powered messaging tool, which will ensure fidelity to the BA model and clinicians will have access to real-time clinical information about their patients to guide more targeted treatment (competence). By improving the efficiency and competence of mental health coaches in the context of mobile mental health services, we expect patients to make greater gains in depression, mood-related disability, and in achieving personal goals. In order to evaluate the feasibility, tolerability, and overall impact of the enhancements to PRIME, we will spend Year 1 engaging stakeholders in a human centered iterative design process and spend Years 2-3 conducting a pilot randomized controlled trial in which we will randomize 120 individuals with depression to either receive 8- weeks of 1) PRIME 1.0 (current version) OR 2) PRIME 2.0 (version with the NLP-powered clinician dashboard). Using BRIGHTEN, our mobile clinical trial platform, we will recruit participants, consent, screen, evaluate and deliver the intervention entirely remotely. The pilot data from this study will be used to prepare for a R01 study to definitively determine whether PRIME may be used to efficiently and effectively improve outcomes for a significantly larger number of individuals with depression.

Because neural network dysfunction is widely considered to be associated with psychopathology, improvements in recording technologies offer exciting opportunities. They also create big statistical challenges due to greatly increased complexity. The research in this grant aims to provide methods for analyzing the ways that network structure may change with particular variables, including those that help characterize behavior, which involves the transmission of neural information at multiple timescales. Fast timescales include oscillations and neural synchrony, which could provide an essential mechanism of neural network information flow and may be a marker that distinguishes normal from diseased states. At slower timescales there is considerable redundancy in the recorded signals, which suggests dimensionality reduction. New methods investigated in this research program can accommodate both faster and slower timescales, and they can also accommodate relationships arising from the spatial configuration of electrodes that record neural signals. These methods are tailored to handle spike trains, LFP, and MEG data, especially as they might arise in experiments related to mental health research. Because a neural spike train is a set of times at which a neuron fired, it is common to consider it to be a point process, which is the statistical model set up to handle sequences of event times.

"Behavioral, Physiological, and Quantitative Models of Pro-Social Behavior Project Summary: This project represents an interdisciplinary approach to modeling the neural and physiological dynamics of prosocial behavior. Advances in wireless electronics, wearable sensors, computing power, machine learning, signal processing, robotics, information theory, and neuromorphic engineering combined with innovative behavioral design and social neuroanatomical theory make possible the launch of a novel and integrative effort to model the dynamics underlying prosociality. Leveraging the expertise of our highly collaborative cross-functional team we aim to: (1) characterize the physiological (brain/autonomic) signatures of committing a prosocial act; (2) characterize the physiological signatures of experiencing/receiving a prosocial act; (3) quantify the extent to which the physiological dynamics of the recipient, while experiencing a stressful behavioral epoch, predict their social decisions as the actor; and (4) develop the iRat as an “ethnodroid”, designed to elicit social behaviors through its own behavior while acting as a videographer in close proximity to the rats. Success in achieving all or even a subset of the target capabilities will demonstrate the power of this innovative approach in a virtually limitless array of medical applications. Results of the proposed project will serve as a game-changing springboard for the development of models of coordination and regulation of the brain and body towards efficacious sociality. The work will provide a foundation for future development of techniques to modulate the system for the purpose of restoring balance, regulation, and prosociality towards improved mental and physical health, in addition to interventions aimed towards preventative health. A byproduct of the work will involve technological advances for measuring physiological signals in a relatively unobtrusive fashion and in the development of contextual robotic tools for assessing social behavior. Such advancements will spur additional research programs. Nationally and Internationally, the development and display of prosocial behavior has been associated with more functional family relationships, with stronger mental health, with higher success in school, with greater physical health, and with better empathic responding. Thus, engaging in the proposed research and understanding the predictive dynamics of the system can allow the development of quantitative metrics for diagnosis, treatment and understanding of stress-related mental health disorders – that modulate or are modulated by – social dynamics. Project Narrative Gaining a formal understanding of the brain and body dynamics underlying prosocial behavior is central to understanding the dysregulation of this system that underlies developmental disorders, social disorders, psychopathology, schizotypal behaviors, and anti-social acts. Thus, it is imporant to develop animal models for the purpose of probing the system and ultimately developing ways to regulate the dynamics in order to restore balance and improve physical and mental health.","Behavioral, Physiological, and Quantitative Models of Pro-Social Behavior",9160973,R01MH110514,"['amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' Autonomic nervous system ', ' Behavior ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' electronic device ', ' Electronics ', ' Empathy ', ' Engineering ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Family Relations ', ' Family Relationship ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Information Theory ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Biological Models ', ' Phenotype ', ' Probability ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Rat ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Rattus ', ' Research ', ' respiratory mechanism ', ' Respiration ', ' Robotics ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodent ', ' schizotypal ', ' Schizotypal Personality Disorder ', ' Schools ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' sociobehavior ', ' Social Behavior ', ' Stress ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Medical ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Individual ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' behavioral control ', ' Behavioral Manipulation ', ' Behavior Control ', ' programs ', ' System ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' respiratory ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' success ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' Animal Model ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' neuronal signaling ', ' neural signaling ', ' nerve signaling ', ' glial signaling ', ' glia signaling ', ' axonal signaling ', ' axon-glial signaling ', ' axon signaling ', ' Neuronal Transmission ', ' Nerve Transmission ', ' Nerve Impulse Transmission ', ' neurotransmission ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' mate ', ' Partner in relationship ', ' social ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' model development ', ' technique development ', ' developmental disorder ', ' developmental disease/disorder ', ' Data ', ' wireless ', ' Wireless Technology ', ' To specify ', ' Cardiac ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' Behavioral Model ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' neural model ', ' mental health related disorder ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' signal processing ', ' antisocial behavior ', ' anti-social behavior ', ' dynamic system ', ' dynamical system ', ' ']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2016,517160,CA-52,0.12806225248192984
"A Common Framework for ""Big Data"" Mental Health Research on Twitter ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The last decade has seen explosive growth of online social networks (OSNs), which are now a pervasive part of everyday life for many people. ""Big data"" analyses of OSNs have enormous potential to enable new discoveries and applications in public health. For example we may soon be able to study how mental health indicators vary over time and between communities and regions; how major events like disasters and mass shootings affect community mental health; and potentially even use social media for individual-level screening and diagnosis. But in order to do this effectively, psychologists need to know how to make sense of vast amounts of digital records of raw behavior. That will require interdisciplinary collaborations between psychology and computer science to create new tools and methods for automated analyses of mental health variables in large and complex datasets. The goal of this project is to develop new metrics for doing large-scale, ""big data"" mental health research on Twitter, a popular online social network service with a large and diverse user base in the United States that makes most user-generated content publicly available. We are particularly interested in how Twitter data can be used to draw inferences about users' personality traits (which are indicative of risk and vulnerability), emotions, and clinical symptoms. To date, researchers studying mental health on Twitter have focused on a small number of metrics which often differ from study to study and are not always well-validated. We do not yet have a unified, comprehensive understanding of how mental health characteristics can be measured and studied online. Our project has three goals. First, we will gather data from a very large, representative sample of American Twitter users to map out what meaningful metrics can be derived from Twitter data. What can be reliably measured, and how are different kinds of metrics related to each other? By studying relationships and overlaps among these variables, we expect to identify a key set of online metrics that can be used to characterize important psychological differences among users. Second, we will recruit a sample of Twitter users to complete standardized assessments of personality, emotion, and clinical symptoms. We will look to see what kinds of online behaviors are reliable and valid markers of these psychological variables. Third, to demonstrate the utility of these markers we will monitor millions of Twitter accounts around the country for one year to measure how one specific kind of community trauma, mass shootings, affects indicators of personality, emotion, and mental health. We expect to find effects of such events on the online expression of emotion and clinical symptoms immediately following an event, and perhaps longer-term effects that endure beyond the immediate aftermath. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will allow us to identify important markers of personality, emotion, and mental health in Twitter data. This will be useful to researchers who want to use ""big data"" approaches to study mental health, and to policy applications to study individual or regional variations and reactions to events.","A Common Framework for ""Big Data"" Mental Health Research on Twitter",9132357,R21MH106879,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anxiety ', ' Behavior ', ' Communities ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Collection ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Dictionary ', ' Disasters ', ' Emotions ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Linguistic ', ' Linguistics ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Maps ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Structural Models ', ' Personality ', ' Personality Assessment ', ' Psychologist ', ' Psychology ', ' Psychometrics ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' Public Health ', ' Records ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Friends ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' specimen collection ', ' sample collection ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Link ', ' Personality Traits ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Reaction ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Country ', ' expression of emotion ', ' emotional expression ', ' showing emotion ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' transdisciplinary collaboration ', ' interdisciplinary collaboration ', ' computer science ', ' member ', ' Categories ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' study characteristics ', ' digital ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Trauma ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' social networking website ', ' web-based social networking ', ' social networking web site ', ' social networking site ', ' online social networking ', ' post-traumatic stress ', ' posttraumatic stress ', ' screening ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' Positive Valence ', ' Negative Valence ', ' social media ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R21,2016,172209,OR-04,0.16704603697185685
"Statistical Methods for Neural Mechanisms Mediating Cognitive System in Mental Health Research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Psychiatric disorders, as well as normal aging, are often associated with a wide range of cognitive changes. Recent developments in neuroscience, particularly multimodal neuroimaging techniques, can provide better understanding of neural mechanisms that underlie these changes. Mediation analysis is a popularly used statistical method to investigate neural mechanisms. However, existing statistical methods were not designed to accommodate such large-scale, multi-dimensional, and complicated data in mediation analysis. The overarching aim of my K01 Mentored Research Development Award is to acquire training that will allow me to pursue a line of mental health research related to cognition and to develop novel statistical methods to support the emerging research in cognitive neuroimaging and mental health. I propose to receive training in: 1) cognition and its relationship with aging and psychopathology; 2) neural basis in cognition and multimodal neuroimaging; 3) functional mediation and selective mediation analysis. This will provide me with the tools to conduct research that will fill significant gaps in the statistical analyses on cognitive neuroimaging, particularly focusing on aging and neurodegeneration-associated cognitive decline: First, I propose to review and develop analytic tools to examine how aging and psychopathology affect cognitive system constructs. Understanding the patterns of age-related differences in each of these cognitive constructs and the possible heterogeneity related to the psychopathology is of great importance. I will test nonlinearity and heterogeneity in the latent cognitive constructs using two independent large data. Second, I will develop and examine activation networks (reference ability neural networks (RANNs)) associated with each of the cognitive constructs. Although it is critical to understand underlying neural networks of cognition, there are many unsolved problems in investigating the presence or structure of RANNs. I will develop a method to derive underlying networks, find RANNs taking into account possible spatial overlap among RANNs, and investigate the relationship between RANNs expression and performance on the concomitant cognitive constructs. Third, I will develop selective mediation analyses to examine the relationship between imaged neural substrates of aging and psychiatric disorder, such as regional volume loss, and cognitive decline and test if the different imaged brain modalities selectively mediate cognitive aging by influencing the expression of cognitive ability constructs. In totality, this training and research will inform hypotheses for an R01 grant application to be submitted in Year 4 of the award period. While to date I have exemplified a productive research career in biostatistics and psychiatry, I need substantially more training for successful completion of the research proposed in this application and to make a lasting contribution to the field of mental health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The present application develops new statistical methods to examine neural mechanisms in the context of cognitive system constructs. The training and research proposed here will form the basis for developing a new line of statistical methods to identify functional neural mechanisms related to cognitive constructs and examine the role of brain in cognitive changes associated with psychiatric disorders. These inquires have substantial promise for mental health; accurate identification of functional and structural neural system and their mechanisms is crucial to better understanding mental illness and developing new treatments.",Statistical Methods for Neural Mechanisms Mediating Cognitive System in Mental Health Research,9145621,K01AG051348,"['Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Award ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Cognition ', ' cognitive syndrome ', ' cognitive disorder ', ' cognitive disease ', ' Cognition Disorders ', ' Data Sources ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Pathology ', ' Psychiatry ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' Research ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' research and development ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Testing ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' career ', ' method development ', ' brain visualization ', ' Brain imaging ', ' Training ', ' cortical atrophy ', ' brain atrophy ', ' cerebral atrophy ', ' Measurement ', ' Multi-center studies ', ' Multicenter Studies ', ' liquid ', ' fluid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' tool ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' age related memory dysfunction ', ' age related cognitive impairment ', ' age related cognitive deficit ', ' age associated memory decline ', ' Benign senescent forgetfulness ', ' Age-related cognitive decline ', ' Age-associated cognitive decline ', ' Age-associated memory impairment ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Episodic memory ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Performance ', ' neural network ', ' Biological Neural Networks ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Mediation ', ' Modality ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' brain volume ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' cognitive change ', ' Data ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Research Training ', ' Cognitive ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' aging effect ', ' age effect ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' pathological aging ', ' Cognitive aging ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' cognitive system ', ' normal aging ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' cognitive task ', ' cognitive ability ', ' ']",NIA,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,K01,2016,131400,NY-13,0.1291389837459395
"Real-Time Mobile Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Serious Mental Illness DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project responds to RFA MH 13-260 ""Harnessing Advanced Health Technologies to Drive Mental Health Improvement,"" and is led by a New/Early Stage Investigator. Bipolar disorder (BD) and Schizophrenia (SZ) are leading causes of disability and are the costliest disorders to treat among serious mental illnesses. Ample evidence exists that evidence-based psychotherapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) produce clinically significant improvements in symptoms of BD and SZ, and yet only 5% of patients in the community can access these treatments. Access to CBT for serious mental illnesses is limited by the restricted pool of trained providers, the resource intensity of these treatments, and cessation of reimbursement for psychological services in many public mental health systems. Our research in BD and SZ over the past five years indicates that mobile phones can provide automated yet personalized cognitive behavioral intervention that is feasible, acceptable, and associated with improvements in symptoms, medication adherence and socialization. Our intervention, called CBT2go, integrates ecological momentary assessment with personalized interventions delivered in the moment that symptoms and related experiences occur. We have developed an innovative platform that functions on various screen types, operating system, or data access technologies, and we have begun to incorporate innovative features into CBT2go, including location-based data and personalized predictive modeling, that can potentially lead to transformative mobile interventions. We propose a research study with the overarching aims of evaluating the effectiveness of CBT2go, gathering necessary data to refine its innovative features, and examining its costs, facilitators, and barries to implementation in a public mental health system. We propose a randomized controlled trial with three arms: 1) CBT2go, 2) an ecological momentary assessment only condition to control for self-monitoring and device contact, and 3) standard care. A total of 255 participants with either BD or SZ will be recruited from a large public mental health system that has minimal access to CBT. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 6 weeks (mid-treatment), 12 weeks (post-treatment) and 24 weeks (follow-up). The primary outcome of the study will be clinician rated global psychopathology, and secondary outcomes will include medication adherence, social functioning, and mental health service utilization. Recognizing that not all participants wil benefit, we propose to examine differential effectiveness in sub-groups. We will also examine mechanisms of change to inform mobile intervention design, focusing on the impact of CBT2go on cognitive insight and dysfunctional attitudes, which are two mediators of change in traditionally delivered CBT. Drawing from experience in implementation research, we will employ a mixed methods approach to assessing the facilitators, barriers, and costs of adoption of CBT2go from perspectives of consumers, technology experts, administrators and front-line clinicians. This study will lay the groundwork for CBT2go to be adapted and implemented with high fidelity in healthcare settings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bipolar disorder and schizophrenia are two of the most disabling and costly mental health problems, and few people with these illnesses in the community have access to evidence-based psychological interventions that improve outcomes like symptoms and medication adherence. We have developed, and propose to evaluate, new technology for delivering personalized real-time interventions to people with serious mental illnesses that bypasses current barriers to accessing psychological treatments. If effective, this intervention could help to improve the mental health of people with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia in a variety of treatment settings.",Real-Time Mobile Cognitive Behavioral

"Monitoring and Stabilizing Behavioral Rhythms to Improve Mental Health Abstract: HealthRhythms, Inc. Substantial evidence supports the idea that disruptions in the regularity of behavioral routines (or ‘social rhythms’) can lead to the onset of psychiatric symptoms and full blown episodes via their impact on endogenous circadian rhythms and, conversely that stable social routines protect against new mood episodes. Based on our conviction that monitoring, evaluating, and increasing the regularity of behavioral rhythms has broad applicability for improving mental health, we established HealthRhythms, Inc. (www.healthrhythms.com) with the goal of using mobile technology to add the layer of mental health care to all of healthcare. Our product model capitalizes on the ubiquity and intimacy of smartphones and their capacity to sense parameters of behavior that represent key indicators of mental health on a 24/7 basis captured in the user’s natural environment, opposed to the sporadic, in-clinic measurement that has characterized mental healthcare to date. The product we envision will ultimately have three pillars: Rhythm Sensing, Rhythm Trending, and Rhythm Stabilization. The first two of these pillars have been developed and thousands of licenses for our product have already been sold. Building on our accomplishments to date, this SBIR Phase II Direct proposal extends our work in three ways: 1) further validating our existing technology, 2) developing the next stage of our technology and 3) expanding and improving our prediction models and demonstrating the cost-effectiveness of our technology. The Specific Aims are: Aim 1: Enhance our Rhythm Trending capabilities through intensive examination and analysis of data from the 3,000+ patients with whom our product has already been deployed. Aim 2: Develop the envisioned Rhythm Stabilization pillar of our technology. Aim 3: Expand the nature of the data included in our prediction models and demonstrate their utility.  Project Narrative HealthRhythms, Inc. is on a mission to become the world leader in tracking clinically meaningful behavioral health rhythms in order to provide automated intervention advice to patients around the globe. The work we propose in this Direct Level II SBIR application, will enable HealthRhythms to be certain that 1) we are using all the power of the smartphone to get the measurement of behavioral health exactly right and 2) we can use those measurements to help individuals with depression or anxiety make changes in their behavior that are right for them and, thereby, reduce their symptoms and keep those symptoms from coming back.",Monitoring and Stabilizing Behavioral Rhythms to Improve Mental Health,9346502,R44MH113520,"['Anxiety ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Dorsum ', ' Back ', ' Behavior ', ' diurnal variation ', ' daily biorhythm ', ' circadian process ', ' circadian ', ' Twenty-Four Hour Rhythm ', ' Nyctohemeral Rhythm ', ' Diurnal Rhythm ', ' Circadian Rhythms ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communication ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data representation ', ' Data Reporting ', ' Data Sources ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Environment ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Inpatients ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Length of Stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital days ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mission ', ' Modernization ', ' Moods ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Patients ', ' Periodicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Phonation ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Sleep ', ' Suggestion ', ' Technology ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Cost Savings ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' Individual ', ' Licensing ', ' Measurement ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Frequencies ', ' Stream ', ' Clinic ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' experience ', ' behavior measurement ', ' behavioral measurement ', ' behavioral measure ', ' novel ', ' intimate behavior ', ' intimacy ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' behavioral health ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' Health system ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' Preparation ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' Behavioral ', ' Output ', ' convict ', ' Population ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' prototype ', ' patient population ', ' mHealth ', ' mobile health ', ' m-Health ', ' clinical predictors ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' social media ', ' mobile computing ', ' mobile technology ', ' mobile platform ', ' psychiatric symptom ', ' ']",NIMH,"HEALTH RHYTHMS, INC.",R44,2017,964251,NY-12,0.18140115321234704
"Statistical Methods for Neural Mechanisms Mediating Cognitive System in Mental Health Research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Psychiatric disorders, as well as normal aging, are often associated with a wide range of cognitive changes. Recent developments in neuroscience, particularly multimodal neuroimaging techniques, can provide better understanding of neural mechanisms that underlie these changes. Mediation analysis is a popularly used statistical method to investigate neural mechanisms. However, existing statistical methods were not designed to accommodate such large-scale, multi-dimensional, and complicated data in mediation analysis. The overarching aim of my K01 Mentored Research Development Award is to acquire training that will allow me to pursue a line of mental health research related to cognition and to develop novel statistical methods to support the emerging research in cognitive neuroimaging and mental health. I propose to receive training in: 1) cognition and its relationship with aging and psychopathology; 2) neural basis in cognition and multimodal neuroimaging; 3) functional mediation and selective mediation analysis. This will provide me with the tools to conduct research that will fill significant gaps in the statistical analyses on cognitive neuroimaging, particularly focusing on aging and neurodegeneration-associated cognitive decline: First, I propose to review and develop analytic tools to examine how aging and psychopathology affect cognitive system constructs. Understanding the patterns of age-related differences in each of these cognitive constructs and the possible heterogeneity related to the psychopathology is of great importance. I will test nonlinearity and heterogeneity in the latent cognitive constructs using two independent large data. Second, I will develop and examine activation networks (reference ability neural networks (RANNs)) associated with each of the cognitive constructs. Although it is critical to understand underlying neural networks of cognition, there are many unsolved problems in investigating the presence or structure of RANNs. I will develop a method to derive underlying networks, find RANNs taking into account possible spatial overlap among RANNs, and investigate the relationship between RANNs expression and performance on the concomitant cognitive constructs. Third, I will develop selective mediation analyses to examine the relationship between imaged neural substrates of aging and psychiatric disorder, such as regional volume loss, and cognitive decline and test if the different imaged brain modalities selectively mediate cognitive aging by influencing the expression of cognitive ability constructs. In totality, this training and research will inform hypotheses for an R01 grant application to be submitted in Year 4 of the award period. While to date I have exemplified a productive research career in biostatistics and psychiatry, I need substantially more training for successful completion of the research proposed in this application and to make a lasting contribution to the field of mental health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The present application develops new statistical methods to examine neural mechanisms in the context of cognitive system constructs. The training and research proposed here will form the basis for developing a new line of statistical methods to identify functional neural mechanisms related to cognitive constructs and examine the role of brain in cognitive changes associated with psychiatric disorders. These inquires have substantial promise for mental health; accurate identification of functional and structural neural system and their mechanisms is crucial to better understanding mental illness and developing new treatments.",Statistical Methods for Neural Mechanisms Mediating Cognitive System in Mental Health Research,9278065,K01AG051348,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Award ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Cognition ', ' cognitive syndrome ', ' cognitive disorder ', ' cognitive disease ', ' Cognition Disorders ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Data Sources ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Pathology ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Testing ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' career ', ' method development ', ' brain visualization ', ' Brain imaging ', ' Training ', ' cortical atrophy ', ' brain atrophy ', ' cerebral atrophy ', ' Measurement ', ' Multi-center studies ', ' Multicenter Studies ', ' Liquid substance ', ' liquid ', ' fluid ', ' tool ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Age-associated memory impairment ', ' age related memory dysfunction ', ' age related cognitive impairment ', ' age related cognitive deficit ', ' age associated memory decline ', ' Benign senescent forgetfulness ', ' Age-related cognitive decline ', ' Age-associated cognitive decline ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Episodic memory ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' Performance ', ' Biological Neural Networks ', ' neural network ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' novel ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Modality ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' brain volume ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' cognitive change ', ' Data ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Cognitive ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' aging effect ', ' age effect ', ' pathological aging ', ' Cognitive aging ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' analytical tool ', ' cognitive system ', ' normal aging ', ' public health relevance ', ' multimodality ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' cognitive task ', ' cognitive ability ', ' imaging study ', ' ']",NIA,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,K01,2017,131400,NY-13,0.1291389837459395
"Estimating Population Effects in Mental Health Research Using Meta-Analysis Dr. Hwanhee Hong is a post-doctoral fellow in the Department of Mental Health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Dr. Hong obtained statistical background for biomedical research from the University of Minnesota and Harvard School of Public Health, where she completed a PhD and a MS in biostatistics, respectively. This K99 training award will help her obtain critical knowledge in mental health research and focused statistical methods to accomplish the proposed project. The proposed project aims to (1) develop statistical methods for estimating population treatment effects in the context of mental health, integrating meta-analytic techniques with a number of existing survey data analysis methods and generalizability methods for a single randomized trial, (2) validate and assess performance of the proposed methods, and apply them to real investigative randomized trials for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and (3) extend the proposed methods to network meta-analysis, comparing multiple treatments at once, for finding the best treatment for the general population. This project will enhance the use of clinical trials and meta-analyses in mental health, yielding methods to make better decisions about intervention implementation in general populations, which fits the National Institute of Mental Health’s mission. The two-year mentored training program consists of organized mentorship with regular in-person individual meetings, team meetings, formal coursework in both mental health and biostatistics, seminars, working groups, academic conferences, and career development activities. These training activities will provide the groundwork for the following three-year independent stage. Short-term career goals include to establish a better understanding of mental health research, particularly complex features of mental disorders and outcomes from relevant clinical trials, advanced topics in causal inference, and additional statistical methods for generalizing results of meta-analyses including survey weighting and flexible machine learning methods. Long-term career goals include to build an independent research portfolio and become a leading methodologist in mental health and other multidisciplinary research. The Department of Mental Health of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health provides an ideal setting for training a new independent methodologist in mental health with an extensive program of formal and informal education for post-doctoral researchers, opportunities for collaboration with researchers having expertise in diverse areas, and resources for career development. Dr. Hong will also use all available resources from other Departments including biostatistics, epidemiology, and psychiatry. This environment maximizes the potential for Dr. Hong to obtain the necessary training and perform the research to establish herself as a skilled investigator with an independent research program. This project will help mental health researchers generalize, apply, and implement findings from meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials to target populations. Traditional meta-analyses enable us to borrow strength across multiple studies to gain more power, resulting in reliable and precise effect estimates; however they do not consider how well the trials represent target populations of interest. By developing methods to help generalize the results of meta-analyses, we will help translate results into appropriate decisions regarding broad implementation and clinical practice.",Estimating Population Effects in Mental Health Research Using Meta-Analysis,9385505,K99MH111807,"['Award ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Sources ', ' Decision Making ', ' Environment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Minnesota ', ' Mission ', ' Persons ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Placebos ', ' sham therapy ', ' Sham Treatment ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Safety ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Target Populations ', ' training module ', ' Training Activity ', ' Training Programs ', ' Translating ', ' Trees ', ' Universities ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Bayesian statistics ', ' Bayesian statistical inference ', ' Bayesian statistical analysis ', ' Bayesian spatial analysis ', ' Bayesian network analysis ', ' Bayesian inference ', ' Bayesian Analysis ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Collaborations ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' Performance ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' career development ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Meta-Analyses ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' Data ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' trial treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' Characteristics ', ' work group ', ' working group ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' treatment effect ', ' evidence base ', ' standard of care ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' clinical practice ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' RDoC ', ' Bayesian Modeling ', ' Bayesian tracking algorithms ', ' Bayesian statistical models ', ' Bayesian spatial models ', ' Bayesian spatial image models ', ' Bayesian spatial data model ', ' Bayesian nonparametric models ', ' Bayesian network model ', ' Bayesian hierarchical model ', ' Bayesian framework ', ' Bayesian belief updating model ', ' Bayesian belief network ', ' Bayesian adaptive models ', ' Bayesian adaptive designs ', ' Positive Valence ', ' Negative Valence ', ' personalized intervention ', ' precision interventions ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' informal learning ', ' informal instruction ', ' informal education ', ' open data ', ' open-source data ', ' open science ', ' data access ', ' ']",NIMH,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K99,2017,110318,MD-07,0.2593580618205454
"ANALYSIS OF NONSTATIONARY NEURAL DATA ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Much mental health research uses neurophysiological measurements to describe the way neural activity within and across brain regions is related to behavioral function and dysfunction. One kind of signal, known as spike trains, comes from individual neurons. Other signals, including local field potentials (LFPs), electroencephalography (EEGs), and magnetoencephalography (MEG) are based on activity from large numbers of neurons within specified parts of the brain. With all of these sources of data, scientifically rigorous statistical analysis must accommodate unstable fluctuations, associated with movement or thought, known in statistics as non-stationary. The continuing research program of this grant is to develop methods for analyzing non-stationary neural data. The number of neural signals that can be recorded simultaneously has been increasing rapidly. Because neural network dysfunction is widely considered to be associated with psychopathology, improvements in recording technologies offer exciting opportunities. They also create big statistical challenges due to greatly increased complexity. The research in this grant aims to provide methods for analyzing the ways that network structure may change with particular variables, including those that help characterize behavior, which involves the transmission of neural information at multiple timescales. Fast timescales include oscillations and neural synchrony, which could provide an essential mechanism of neural network information flow and may be a marker that distinguishes normal from diseased states. At slower timescales there is considerable redundancy in the recorded signals, which suggests dimensionality reduction. New methods investigated in this research program can accommodate both faster and slower timescales, and they can also accommodate relationships arising from the spatial configuration of electrodes that record neural signals. These methods are tailored to handle spike trains, LFP, and MEG data, especially as they might arise in experiments related to mental health research. Because a neural spike train is a set of times at which a neuron fired, it is common to consider it to be a point process, which is the statistical model set up to handle sequences of event times. The research supported by this grant concerns development and investigation of statistical techniques involving both multi-dimensional continuous time series (for LFP, EEG, and MEG data) and multi-dimensional point processes (for spike trains). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Much mental health research relies on measurements of brain activity across different parts of the brain, and often poses difficult problems in statisticl analysis. The research supported by this grant develops new methods of analyzing brain signals as they evolve across time.

"Scaling a smarter and more efficient intervention: Evaluating the feasibility of disseminating a novel mobile app platform to treat depression ABSTRACT The goal of this project is to conduct a pilot study to test the utility of a Natural Language Processing (NLP) clinical messaging tool to improve the reach and the quality (fidelity and competency) of coaches providing behavioral activation (BA) strategies through a mobile mental health app called Personalized Real-time Intervention for Motivational Enhancement (PRIME). Despite decades of research and development for the treatment of mood disorders, depression has risen from the 5th leading cause of disability to the leading cause in the US. Critical barriers for progress in the field are 1) Poor access to high quality care for consumers; 2) Limited mental health workforce; and 3) Few providers are trained in the delivery of evidence-based treatments. In response to this public health problem, our team is proposing to use a mobile platform to improve access to an evidence based treatment; increase the reach of mental health coaches while supporting the delivery of higher quality of care. We will improve the reach of clinicians by using a NLP-powered messaging tool, which will ensure fidelity to the BA model and clinicians will have access to real-time clinical information about their patients to guide more targeted treatment (competence). By improving the efficiency and competence of mental health coaches in the context of mobile mental health services, we expect patients to make greater gains in depression, mood-related disability, and in achieving personal goals. In order to evaluate the feasibility, tolerability, and overall impact of the enhancements to PRIME, we will spend Year 1 engaging stakeholders in a human centered iterative design process and spend Years 2-3 conducting a pilot randomized controlled trial in which we will randomize 120 individuals with depression to either receive 8- weeks of 1) PRIME 1.0 (current version) OR 2) PRIME 2.0 (version with the NLP-powered clinician dashboard). Using BRIGHTEN, our mobile clinical trial platform, we will recruit participants, consent, screen, evaluate and deliver the intervention entirely remotely. The pilot data from this study will be used to prepare for a R01 study to definitively determine whether PRIME may be used to efficiently and effectively improve outcomes for a significantly larger number of individuals with depression.

We will improve the reach of clinicians by using a NLP- powered messaging tool, which will ensure fidelity to the BA model and clinicians will have access to real-time clinical information about their patients to guide more targeted treatment (competence).

"Behavioral, Physiological, and Quantitative Models of Pro-Social Behavior Project Summary: This project represents an interdisciplinary approach to modeling the neural and physiological dynamics of prosocial behavior. Advances in wireless electronics, wearable sensors, computing power, machine learning, signal processing, robotics, information theory, and neuromorphic engineering combined with innovative behavioral design and social neuroanatomical theory make possible the launch of a novel and integrative effort to model the dynamics underlying prosociality. Leveraging the expertise of our highly collaborative cross-functional team we aim to: (1) characterize the physiological (brain/autonomic) signatures of committing a prosocial act; (2) characterize the physiological signatures of experiencing/receiving a prosocial act; (3) quantify the extent to which the physiological dynamics of the recipient, while experiencing a stressful behavioral epoch, predict their social decisions as the actor; and (4) develop the iRat as an “ethnodroid”, designed to elicit social behaviors through its own behavior while acting as a videographer in close proximity to the rats. Success in achieving all or even a subset of the target capabilities will demonstrate the power of this innovative approach in a virtually limitless array of medical applications. Results of the proposed project will serve as a game-changing springboard for the development of models of coordination and regulation of the brain and body towards efficacious sociality. The work will provide a foundation for future development of techniques to modulate the system for the purpose of restoring balance, regulation, and prosociality towards improved mental and physical health, in addition to interventions aimed towards preventative health. A byproduct of the work will involve technological advances for measuring physiological signals in a relatively unobtrusive fashion and in the development of contextual robotic tools for assessing social behavior. Such advancements will spur additional research programs. Nationally and Internationally, the development and display of prosocial behavior has been associated with more functional family relationships, with stronger mental health, with higher success in school, with greater physical health, and with better empathic responding. Thus, engaging in the proposed research and understanding the predictive dynamics of the system can allow the development of quantitative metrics for diagnosis, treatment and understanding of stress-related mental health disorders – that modulate or are modulated by – social dynamics. Project Narrative Gaining a formal understanding of the brain and body dynamics underlying prosocial behavior is central to understanding the dysregulation of this system that underlies developmental disorders, social disorders, psychopathology, schizotypal behaviors, and anti-social acts. Thus, it is imporant to develop animal models for the purpose of probing the system and ultimately developing ways to regulate the dynamics in order to restore balance and improve physical and mental health.","Behavioral, Physiological, and Quantitative Models of Pro-Social Behavior",9320978,R01MH110514,"['amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' Autonomic nervous system ', ' Behavior ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' electronic device ', ' Electronics ', ' Empathy ', ' Engineering ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Family Relations ', ' Family Relationship ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Information Theory ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Biological Models ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Phenotype ', ' Probability ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Rattus ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Rat ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Research ', ' Respiration ', ' respiratory mechanism ', ' Robotics ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Rodentia ', ' Schizotypal Personality Disorder ', ' schizotypal ', ' Schools ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Social Behavior ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' sociobehavior ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Stress ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Medical ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Individual ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Behavior Control ', ' behavioral control ', ' Behavioral Manipulation ', ' programs ', ' System ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' respiratory ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' success ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Structure ', ' neurotransmission ', ' neuronal signaling ', ' neural signaling ', ' nerve signaling ', ' glial signaling ', ' glia signaling ', ' axonal signaling ', ' axon-glial signaling ', ' axon signaling ', ' Neuronal Transmission ', ' Nerve Transmission ', ' Nerve Impulse Transmission ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Partner in relationship ', ' mate ', ' social ', ' anti social ', ' antisocial ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' model development ', ' technique development ', ' developmental disease/disorder ', ' developmental disorder ', ' CCL4 gene ', ' Small Inducible Cytokine A4 ', ' SCYA4 ', ' Macrophage Inflammatory Protein 1-Beta ', ' MIP1B1 ', ' MIP1B ', ' Immune Activation 2 ', ' Chemokine, CC Motif, Ligand 4 ', ' Chemokine (C-C Motif) Ligand 4 ', ' CCL4 ', ' Act-2 ', ' AT744.1 ', ' ACT2 ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' wireless ', ' Wireless Technology ', ' To specify ', ' Cardiac ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' Behavioral Model ', ' virtual ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' neural model ', ' mental health related disorder ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' signal processing ', ' ']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2017,420351,CA-52,0.12806225248192984

"Impact of Telemedicine on Medicare Beneficiaries with Mental Illness PROJECT SUMMARY Access to mental health specialists is difficult for many patients in the U.S., particularly for the poor and those who live in rural communities. Telemental health is one potential solution for this access problem, and there has been rapid growth in the number of live video-based telemental health visits in the U.S. While there are numerous rigorous randomized-control trials comparing telemental health visits to in-person mental health specialist care, there have been little research on how telemental health is being used in real-world settings. The uptake of telemental health has been very uneven geographically, and what explains this variation is also largely unknown. Our mixed-methods proposal centers on filling these gaps in knowledge. Under the first aim, we will conduct a series of descriptive analyses of data on 75 million adults with Medicare or commercial insurance to understand how telemental health is being used in conjunction with in-person care and whether the growth of telemental health has decreased disparities in the use of mental health specialists among disadvantaged populations. Under the second aim, we seek to explain why there is geographic variation in uptake using robust statistical machine learning. Under the third aim, we exploit the variation in uptake to assess whether communities with greater telemental health penetration have experienced improvements in care for patients with mental illness. In the fourth aim we will conduct qualitative interviews with providers to complement the empirical analyses and understand the key contextual factors underlying our findings. Understanding how telemental health is being used, why there is variation in use of telemental health, and whether telemental health use is associated with higher quality care could help drive future telemental health interventions and influence the ongoing policy debate on telemedicine regulations and reimbursement. Together the results of these aims are consistent with the NIMH's expressed interest in innovative delivery models that can improve care for underserved communities. It is difficult for many patients with mental illness to access care from a mental health specialist. Telemental health is one way to potentially help these patients receive care and the number of such visits for mental illness has increased rapidly. In this project, we will study how telemental health is being used to care for patients with mental illness, what drives variation in use, and whether telemedicine is associated with receipt of higher quality care.",Impact of Telemedicine on Medicare Beneficiaries with Mental Illness,9472495,R01MH112829,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Congresses ', ' meeting reports ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diffusion ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Geography ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' individuals with disabilities ', ' disabled people ', ' disabled individual ', ' disabled ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Handicapped ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Health ', ' Medicare ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Insurance ', ' Interview ', ' Laws ', ' Literature ', ' Medicaid ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Patients ', ' Psychotic Disorders ', ' psychotic illness ', ' Psychoses ', ' Research ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' symposium ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' Rural Community ', ' Specialist ', ' Caring ', ' Telemedicine ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Penetration ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Series ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' Rural ', ' Policies ', ' uptake ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Pattern ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' experience ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' geographic difference ', ' geographic variation ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' trend ', ' beneficiary ', ' medication adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' rapid growth ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' severe mental disorder ', ' serious mental illness ', ' serious mental disorder ', ' persistent mental illness ', ' chronic mental illness ', ' severe mental illness ', ' elderly patient ', ' older patient ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' trial comparing ', ' demographics ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' control trial ', ' population health ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' improved outcome ', ' disadvantaged population ', ' Telemental ', ' care costs ', ' ']",NIMH,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2018,698805,MA-07,0.22129102099471107
"ANALYSIS OF NONSTATIONARY NEURAL DATA ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Much mental health research uses neurophysiological measurements to describe the way neural activity within and across brain regions is related to behavioral function and dysfunction. One kind of signal, known as spike trains, comes from individual neurons. Other signals, including local field potentials (LFPs), electroencephalography (EEGs), and magnetoencephalography (MEG) are based on activity from large numbers of neurons within specified parts of the brain. With all of these sources of data, scientifically rigorous statistical analysis must accommodate unstable fluctuations, associated with movement or thought, known in statistics as non-stationary. The continuing research program of this grant is to develop methods for analyzing non-stationary neural data. The number of neural signals that can be recorded simultaneously has been increasing rapidly. Because neural network dysfunction is widely considered to be associated with psychopathology, improvements in recording technologies offer exciting opportunities. They also create big statistical challenges due to greatly increased complexity. The research in this grant aims to provide methods for analyzing the ways that network structure may change with particular variables, including those that help characterize behavior, which involves the transmission of neural information at multiple timescales. Fast timescales include oscillations and neural synchrony, which could provide an essential mechanism of neural network information flow and may be a marker that distinguishes normal from diseased states. At slower timescales there is considerable redundancy in the recorded signals, which suggests dimensionality reduction. New methods investigated in this research program can accommodate both faster and slower timescales, and they can also accommodate relationships arising from the spatial configuration of electrodes that record neural signals. These methods are tailored to handle spike trains, LFP, and MEG data, especially as they might arise in experiments related to mental health research. Because a neural spike train is a set of times at which a neuron fired, it is common to consider it to be a point process, which is the statistical model set up to handle sequences of event times. The research supported by this grant concerns development and investigation of statistical techniques involving both multi-dimensional continuous time series (for LFP, EEG, and MEG data) and multi-dimensional point processes (for spike trains). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Much mental health research relies on measurements of brain activity across different parts of the brain, and often poses difficult problems in statisticl analysis. The research supported by this grant develops new methods of analyzing brain signals as they evolve across time. Of special interest is the way networks of interacting brain components may change under varying conditions.",ANALYSIS OF NONSTATIONARY NEURAL DATA,9449472,R01MH064537,"['Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electrodes ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Exhibits ', ' Grant ', ' Information Networks ', ' Learning ', ' Least-Squares Analysis ', ' Least-Squares Analyses ', ' Least Squares ', ' Magnetoencephalography ', ' magnetoencephalographic imaging ', ' MEG imaging ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Synaptic Transmission ', ' Neural Transmission ', ' Neurons ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Research ', ' Research Support ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' statistics ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Collaborations ', ' Letters ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Dimensions ', ' Frequencies ', ' Dependence ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' parallel processing ', ' Biological Neural Networks ', ' neural network ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Structure ', ' neurotransmission ', ' neuronal signaling ', ' neural signaling ', ' nerve signaling ', ' glial signaling ', ' glia signaling ', ' axonal signaling ', ' axon-glial signaling ', ' axon signaling ', ' Neuronal Transmission ', ' Nerve Transmission ', ' Nerve Impulse Transmission ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' Time Series Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Brain region ', ' Data ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' network dysfunction ', ' scale up ', ' frontier ', ' neural mechanism ', ' neuromechanism ', ' Implant ', ' network models ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' public health relevance ', ' BigData ', ' Big Data ', ' Gaussianity model ', ' Gaussianity ', ' Gaussian statistics ', ' Gaussian model ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' high dimensionality ', ' source localization ', ' ']",NIMH,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,378758,PA-18,0.11804869207624347
"Scaling a smarter and more efficient intervention: Evaluating the feasibility of disseminating a novel mobile app platform to treat depression ABSTRACT The goal of this project is to conduct a pilot study to test the utility of a Natural Language Processing (NLP) clinical messaging tool to improve the reach and the quality (fidelity and competency) of coaches providing behavioral activation (BA) strategies through a mobile mental health app called Personalized Real-time Intervention for Motivational Enhancement (PRIME). Despite decades of research and development for the treatment of mood disorders, depression has risen from the 5th leading cause of disability to the leading cause in the US. Critical barriers for progress in the field are 1) Poor access to high quality care for consumers; 2) Limited mental health workforce; and 3) Few providers are trained in the delivery of evidence-based treatments. In response to this public health problem, our team is proposing to use a mobile platform to improve access to an evidence based treatment; increase the reach of mental health coaches while supporting the delivery of higher quality of care. We will improve the reach of clinicians by using a NLP-powered messaging tool, which will ensure fidelity to the BA model and clinicians will have access to real-time clinical information about their patients to guide more targeted treatment (competence). By improving the efficiency and competence of mental health coaches in the context of mobile mental health services, we expect patients to make greater gains in depression, mood-related disability, and in achieving personal goals. In order to evaluate the feasibility, tolerability, and overall impact of the enhancements to PRIME, we will spend Year 1 engaging stakeholders in a human centered iterative design process and spend Years 2-3 conducting a pilot randomized controlled trial in which we will randomize 120 individuals with depression to either receive 8- weeks of 1) PRIME 1.0 (current version) OR 2) PRIME 2.0 (version with the NLP-powered clinician dashboard). Using BRIGHTEN, our mobile clinical trial platform, we will recruit participants, consent, screen, evaluate and deliver the intervention entirely remotely. The pilot data from this study will be used to prepare for a R01 study to definitively determine whether PRIME may be used to efficiently and effectively improve outcomes for a significantly larger number of individuals with depression.

"Monitoring and Stabilizing Behavioral Rhythms to Improve Mental Health Abstract: HealthRhythms, Inc. Substantial evidence supports the idea that disruptions in the regularity of behavioral routines (or ‘social rhythms’) can lead to the onset of psychiatric symptoms and full blown episodes via their impact on endogenous circadian rhythms and, conversely that stable social routines protect against new mood episodes. Based on our conviction that monitoring, evaluating, and increasing the regularity of behavioral rhythms has broad applicability for improving mental health, we established HealthRhythms, Inc. (www.healthrhythms.com) with the goal of using mobile technology to add the layer of mental health care to all of healthcare. Our product model capitalizes on the ubiquity and intimacy of smartphones and their capacity to sense parameters of behavior that represent key indicators of mental health on a 24/7 basis captured in the user’s natural environment, opposed to the sporadic, in-clinic measurement that has characterized mental healthcare to date. The product we envision will ultimately have three pillars: Rhythm Sensing, Rhythm Trending, and Rhythm Stabilization. The first two of these pillars have been developed and thousands of licenses for our product have already been sold. Building on our accomplishments to date, this SBIR Phase II Direct proposal extends our work in three ways: 1) further validating our existing technology, 2) developing the next stage of our technology and 3) expanding and improving our prediction models and demonstrating the cost-effectiveness of our technology.

"Monitoring and Stabilizing Behavioral Rhythms to Improve Mental Health Abstract: HealthRhythms, Inc. Substantial evidence supports the idea that disruptions in the regularity of behavioral routines (or ‘social rhythms’) can lead to the onset of psychiatric symptoms and full blown episodes via their impact on endogenous circadian rhythms and, conversely that stable social routines protect against new mood episodes. Based on our conviction that monitoring, evaluating, and increasing the regularity of behavioral rhythms has broad applicability for improving mental health, we established HealthRhythms, Inc.

"Dual Mechanisms of Cognitive Control This project focuses on understanding the psychological and neural mechanisms that give rise to cognitive control. Cognitive control processes are a component of human mental function that is fundamentally important in a wide range of domains, including attention, working memory, episodic memory, and decision making. Cognitive control disruptions are thought to be a major source of functional impairment for individuals suffering from a variety of mental health disorders and neuropsychiatric diseases, which is why they feature prominently in the NIMH RDoC matrix. Over the last decade, we have developed a theoretically coherent and mechanistic model, the Dual Mechanisms of Control (DMC) framework, which has the following core tenets: 1) cognitive control can operate in distinct modes, proactive and reactive; 2) these modes are associated with unique dynamic neural signatures, involving a shift between sustained and transient engagement of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and its interactions with the cingulo-opercular network (CON) and fronto-striatal circuitry; 3) they represent a core dimension of variability, present across a range of cognitive domains (i.e., indicating a psychologically coherent construct); 4) this variability is both state-related (and thus affected by task/situation and endogenous factors) and trait-related (a key component of individual variation); and 5) the variation encompasses cognitive control function in healthy young adults, but also in more extreme forms, contributes to dysfunction present in various impaired populations (e.g., schizophrenia, depression, ADHD, aging). Under a current MERIT award, we have been directly testing these core tenets of the DMC framework, through a large-scale project, which samples monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs and participants from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and to comprehensively characterize proactive and reactive control at the behavioral, neural, and genetic levels. The current proposal takes full advantage of the extensive infrastructure we have already developed for this project to dramatically expand its scope, explanatory depth, and utility to the scientific community. Specifically, we propose a rigorous, multi-pronged study, that integrates our optimized cognitive control task battery with mindfulness skills training (MT), a longitudinal design with repeated neuroimaging assessments, comprehensive “neuro-psychometric” characterization of individual variation utilizing state-of-the-art analytic techniques, and incorporation of current best practices (i.e., following Open Science Framework [OSF] recommendations), to maximize the transparency, reproducibility, and ease of dissemination of project tools and findings. Success is in this effort will have important theoretical and clinical implications, by providing a clearer understanding of the sources of normal human variation, and even more importantly, highlighting potential risk vulnerability factors for a range of mental health disorders. This project will provide detailed information regarding the brain-basis of normal human variation in higher mental functions such as attention, memory and decision-making, and how such functions are impacted by positive lifestyle interventions (i.e., mindfulness training). This information has high relevance for public health by furthering our understanding of the relationship between mental health and illness (e.g.,  schizophrenia, depression) and of the vulnerability and protective factors that contribute to mental illness risk.",Dual Mechanisms of Cognitive Control,9613900,R37MH066078,"['Affect ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Attention ', ' Award ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Communities ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' striatal ', ' Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Decision Making ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Insula of Reil ', ' Island of Reil ', ' Insula ', ' Central Lobe ', ' Memory ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' working memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Parkinsons disease ', "" Parkinson's disease "", "" Parkinson's "", ' Parkinson ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Recommendation ', ' Risk ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Standardization ', ' Task Performances ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Twin Multiple Birth ', ' Twins ', ' Monozygotic twins ', ' Identical Twins ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' analytical method ', ' Anterior ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Nonlinear Dynamic ', ' Non-linear Dynamics ', ' Non-linear Dynamic ', ' Nonlinear Dynamics ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Dimensions ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' Equation ', ' skills training ', ' Episodic memory ', ' success ', ' cingulate cortex ', ' neuroregulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neural regulation ', ' neural control ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' trait ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' neural circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' functional disability ', ' Functional impairment ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Hyperactivity Disorder NOS ', ' ADHD ', ' AD/HD ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' Cognitive ', ' Endogenous Factors ', ' Scheme ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' improved functioning ', ' psychological outcomes ', ' Population ', ' Individual Differences ', ' neural mechanism ', ' neuromechanism ', ' life style intervention ', ' lifestyle intervention ', ' Impairment ', ' cognitive control ', ' public health relevance ', ' mindfulness ', ' cognitive enhancement ', ' longitudinal design ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' RDoC ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' mental function ', ' causal diagram ', ' causal model ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' project dissemination ', ' program dissemination ', ' dynamical system ', ' dynamic system ', ' open-source data ', ' open science ', ' open data ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' connectome ', ' Mindfulness-based Treatment ', ' Mindfulness-based Training ', ' Mindfulness-based Therapy ', ' Mindfulness-based Approach ', ' Mindfulness Treatment ', ' Mindfulness Therapy ', ' Mindfulness Approach ', ' Mindfulness Training ', ' protective factors ', ' individual variability ', ' individual heterogeneity ', ' individual variation ', ' ']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R37,2018,685847,MO-01,0.17623689524690767
"Bioinformatics for post-traumatic stress Project Summary/Abstract Maladaptive complications following trauma, including post-traumatic stress (PTS), are highly prevalent in both veterans and civilians, and have been difficult to accurately diagnose, manage and treat. Debate regarding diagnostic criteria and the need to represent the full spectrum of inter-connected features contributing to psychopathology has spawned the development of the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). RDoC is a developing framework to help guide the discovery and validation of new dimensions of mental health disorders and their relationships to underlying biological mechanisms. NIMH now has a rich federated database that currently houses raw data from RDoC-sponsored clinical research, and clinical trial data from the National Database of Clinical Trials (NDCT) with information that may help to unlock the complex and overlapping relationships between symptoms of PTS and the underlying biomarkers to fuel improvements on diagnostic and therapeutic frameworks for trauma recovery. The proposed project will apply bioinformatics and machine learning analytical tools to these large, heterogeneous datasets to identify and validate new research dimensions of trauma-related psychopathology and treatment response trajectories and their predictors. Aim 1 will develop an in silico trauma patient population by integrating data from diverse sources, including cross-sectional and observational longitudinal clinical studies housed within available data repositories for trauma and other related mental health research. Data will include medical history, demographics, diagnostic tests, clinical outcomes, psychological assessments, genomics, imaging, and other relevant study and meta-data. Aim 2 will identify multiple dimensions of PTS diagnostic criteria, using a combination of unsupervised dimension-reduction statistical methods, internal and external cross-validation, and supervised hypothesis testing of predictive models to understand the heterogeneous subtypes of PTS. Aim 3 will deploy unsupervised machine learning methods, such as topological data analysis and hierarchical clustering, to identify unique clusters of patients based on symptomatology to develop clustering methods for precision mapping of PTS patients based on disease severity. Aim 4 will use supervised machine learning techniques for targeted predictive analytics focused on identifying treatment responders from the NDCT, and identification of latent variables that predict treatment response. The results of the proposed research project will greatly enrich the field of computational psychiatry research to identify conserved dimensions associated with the complex relationships of psychopathology and precision treatment planning following exposure to traumatic events. Project Narrative A recent restructuring of diagnostic and research criteria for psychiatric disorders has been implemented to promote greater understanding of the biological mechanisms involved in the development of complex mental health disorders. The proposed project aims to apply bioinformatics and machine learning analytics to large datasets from trauma-exposed patients to identify and validate dimensions of post-traumatic stress (PTS),

"Behavioral, Physiological, and Quantitative Models of Pro-Social Behavior Project Summary: This project represents an interdisciplinary approach to modeling the neural and physiological dynamics of prosocial behavior. Advances in wireless electronics, wearable sensors, computing power, machine learning, signal processing, robotics, information theory, and neuromorphic engineering combined with innovative behavioral design and social neuroanatomical theory make possible the launch of a novel and integrative effort to model the dynamics underlying prosociality. Leveraging the expertise of our highly collaborative cross-functional team we aim to: (1) characterize the physiological (brain/autonomic) signatures of committing a prosocial act; (2) characterize the physiological signatures of experiencing/receiving a prosocial act; (3) quantify the extent to which the physiological dynamics of the recipient, while experiencing a stressful behavioral epoch, predict their social decisions as the actor; and (4) develop the iRat as an “ethnodroid”, designed to elicit social behaviors through its own behavior while acting as a videographer in close proximity to the rats. Success in achieving all or even a subset of the target capabilities will demonstrate the power of this innovative approach in a virtually limitless array of medical applications. Results of the proposed project will serve as a game-changing springboard for the development of models of coordination and regulation of the brain and body towards efficacious sociality. The work will provide a foundation for future development of techniques to modulate the system for the purpose of restoring balance, regulation, and prosociality towards improved mental and physical health, in addition to interventions aimed towards preventative health. A byproduct of the work will involve technological advances for measuring physiological signals in a relatively unobtrusive fashion and in the development of contextual robotic tools for assessing social behavior. Such advancements will spur additional research programs. Nationally and Internationally, the development and display of prosocial behavior has been associated with more functional family relationships, with stronger mental health, with higher success in school, with greater physical health, and with better empathic responding. Thus, engaging in the proposed research and understanding the predictive dynamics of the system can allow the development of quantitative metrics for diagnosis, treatment and understanding of stress-related mental health disorders – that modulate or are modulated by – social dynamics. Project Narrative Gaining a formal understanding of the brain and body dynamics underlying prosocial behavior is central to understanding the dysregulation of this system that underlies developmental disorders, social disorders, psychopathology, schizotypal behaviors, and anti-social acts. Thus, it is imporant to develop animal models for the purpose of probing the system and ultimately developing ways to regulate the dynamics in order to restore balance and improve physical and mental health.","Behavioral, Physiological, and Quantitative Models of Pro-Social Behavior",9502368,R01MH110514,"['Amygdaloid structure ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdala ', ' Autonomic nervous system ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electronics ', ' electronic device ', ' Empathy ', ' Engineering ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Family Relationship ', ' Family Relations ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Information Theory ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Biological Models ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Phenotype ', ' Probability ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Rattus ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Rat ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Research ', ' Respiration ', ' respiratory mechanism ', ' Robotics ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Rodentia ', ' Schizotypal Personality Disorder ', ' schizotypal ', ' Schools ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Social Behavior ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' sociobehavior ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Stress ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Medical ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Individual ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' System ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' respiratory ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' success ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Structure ', ' neurotransmission ', ' neuronal signaling ', ' neural signaling ', ' nerve signaling ', ' glial signaling ', ' glia signaling ', ' axonal signaling ', ' axon-glial signaling ', ' axon signaling ', ' Neuronal Transmission ', ' Nerve Transmission ', ' Nerve Impulse Transmission ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Partner in relationship ', ' mate ', ' social ', ' anti social ', ' antisocial ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' model development ', ' technique development ', ' developmental disease ', ' developmental disorder ', ' CCL4 gene ', ' Small Inducible Cytokine A4 ', ' SCYA4 ', ' Macrophage Inflammatory Protein 1-Beta ', ' MIP1B1 ', ' MIP1B ', ' Immune Activation 2 ', ' Chemokine, CC Motif, Ligand 4 ', ' Chemokine (C-C Motif) Ligand 4 ', ' CCL4 ', ' Act-2 ', ' AT744.1 ', ' ACT2 ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' wireless ', ' Wireless Technology ', ' To specify ', ' Cardiac ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' Behavioral Model ', ' virtual ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' neural model ', ' mental health related disorder ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' signal processing ', ' wearable sensor ', ' wearable device ', ' ']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2018,414455,CA-52,0.12806225248192984
"Statistical Methods for Neural Mechanisms Mediating Cognitive System in Mental Health Research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Psychiatric disorders, as well as normal aging, are often associated with a wide range of cognitive changes. Recent developments in neuroscience, particularly multimodal neuroimaging techniques, can provide better understanding of neural mechanisms that underlie these changes. Mediation analysis is a popularly used statistical method to investigate neural mechanisms. However, existing statistical methods were not designed to accommodate such large-scale, multi-dimensional, and complicated data in mediation analysis. The overarching aim of my K01 Mentored Research Development Award is to acquire training that will allow me to pursue a line of mental health research related to cognition and to develop novel statistical methods to support the emerging research in cognitive neuroimaging and mental health. I propose to receive training in: 1) cognition and its relationship with aging and psychopathology; 2) neural basis in cognition and multimodal neuroimaging; 3) functional mediation and selective mediation analysis. This will provide me with the tools to conduct research that will fill significant gaps in the statistical analyses on cognitive neuroimaging, particularly focusing on aging and neurodegeneration-associated cognitive decline: First, I propose to review and develop analytic tools to examine how aging and psychopathology affect cognitive system constructs. Understanding the patterns of age-related differences in each of these cognitive constructs and the possible heterogeneity related to the psychopathology is of great importance. I will test nonlinearity and heterogeneity in the latent cognitive constructs using two independent large data. Second, I will develop and examine activation networks (reference ability neural networks (RANNs)) associated with each of the cognitive constructs. Although it is critical to understand underlying neural networks of cognition, there are many unsolved problems in investigating the presence or structure of RANNs. I will develop a method to derive underlying networks, find RANNs taking into account possible spatial overlap among RANNs, and investigate the relationship between RANNs expression and performance on the concomitant cognitive constructs. Third, I will develop selective mediation analyses to examine the relationship between imaged neural substrates of aging and psychiatric disorder, such as regional volume loss, and cognitive decline and test if the different imaged brain modalities selectively mediate cognitive aging by influencing the expression of cognitive ability constructs. In totality, this training and research will inform hypotheses for an R01 grant application to be submitted in Year 4 of the award period. While to date I have exemplified a productive research career in biostatistics and psychiatry, I need substantially more training for successful completion of the research proposed in this application and to make a lasting contribution to the field of mental health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The present application develops new statistical methods to examine neural mechanisms in the context of cognitive system constructs. The training and research proposed here will form the basis for developing a new line of statistical methods to identify functional neural mechanisms related to cognitive constructs and examine the role of brain in cognitive changes associated with psychiatric disorders.

Dr. Hong obtained statistical background for biomedical research from the University of Minnesota and Harvard School of Public Health, where she completed a PhD and a MS in biostatistics, respectively. This K99 training award will help her obtain critical knowledge in mental health research and focused statistical methods to accomplish the proposed project. The proposed project aims to (1) develop statistical methods for estimating population treatment effects in the context of mental health, integrating meta-analytic techniques with a number of existing survey data analysis methods and generalizability methods for a single randomized trial, (2) validate and assess performance of the proposed methods, and apply them to real investigative randomized trials for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and (3) extend the proposed methods to network meta-analysis, comparing multiple treatments at once, for finding the best treatment for the general population. This project will enhance the use of clinical trials and meta-analyses in mental health, yielding methods to make better decisions about intervention implementation in general populations, which fits the National Institute of Mental Health’s mission.

"Socioemotional Processing and Aggression Project Summary/Abstract Complex relationships exist between mental illness and aggression, particularly interpersonal aggression that can lead to antisocial behavior. Unfortunately, conducting high-impact mental health research among those who have committed serious aggressive acts against persons has been strategically challenging for many reasons. This research plan employs unique resources that enable advanced cognitive neuroscience research to be conducted in forensic environments. Here we leverage these resources to examine impaired functioning of neural circuits that contribute to specific varieties of serious aggressive behavior. Callous and unemotional traits, impulsive/disinhibited behavior, and appetitive desire to harm others, all have identifiable roots in neurocognitive function. We will examine how clinical levels of these latter traits are related to abnormalities in the neural circuits involved in affective perspective taking, moral decision-making, and behavioral inhibition. Normative neural responses for each of these processes have been well-characterized by our prior work. We seek to differentiate between unique pathophysiological etiologies that contribute to specific behavioral tendencies. We further aim to elucidate the modifying influence of early childhood trauma in these neurocognitive domains. Understanding these differences will promote more sophisticated prevention and intervention strategies that incorporate specific knowledge of neurocognitive vulnerabilities and remedial approaches for improving long-range outcomes for individuals and for the public. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Aggressive behavior is a major public health concern that intersects with challenging venues of mental health research. This research plan implements unique resources to carry out cognitive neuroscience research among highly aggressive inmates with mental illnesses to differentiate among several etiological trajectories promoting these behaviors. The outcomes of this work will foster more sophisticated strategies for recognizing the potential for aggression and implementing more effective interventions, with the ultimate goal of preventing aggression and victimization in society.",Socioemotional Processing and Aggression,9470566,R01MH114028,"['Accounting ', ' Aggressive behavior ', ' Aggression ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdala ', ' Desire for food ', ' Appetite ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Cognition ', ' Decision Making ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Emotions ', ' Empathy ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Forensic Medicine ', ' Forensics ', ' Goals ', ' Judgment ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mentally Ill Persons ', ' Mentally Ill ', ' Mental Patients ', ' Methods ', ' Morals ', ' Motivation ', ' Multivariate Analysis ', ' Multivariate Analyses ', ' Persons ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Paraphilias ', ' Pathology ', ' Perception ', ' Public Health ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Sampling Studies ', ' Societies ', ' Suggestion ', ' Temporal Lobe ', ' temporal cortex ', ' Work ', ' Case Study ', ' case report ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' morphometry ', ' brain visualization ', ' Brain imaging ', ' Anterior ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' self knowledge ', ' self awareness ', ' Self view ', ' Self image ', ' Personal awareness ', ' Self Perception ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' mental status ', ' mental state ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Behavior Control ', ' behavioral control ', ' Behavioral Manipulation ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Knowledge ', ' Victimization ', ' Dimensions ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' experience ', ' early childhood ', ' cohort ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' trait ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' offender ', ' criminal offender ', ' Neurophysiology - biologic function ', ' neural function ', ' social ', ' anti social ', ' antisocial ', ' Ventral Striatum ', ' neural circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Brain region ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Mind-Body Method ', ' mind/body method ', ' mind-body research ', ' Mind/Body Research ', ' Mind Research ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Cognitive ', ' Neurosciences Research ', ' Pathologic ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' callous unemotional trait ', ' childhood trauma ', ' adolescent trauma ', ' pediatric trauma ', ' neglect ', ' behavioral monitoring ', ' Behavior monitoring ', ' Behavioral inhibition ', ' Outcome ', ' independent component analysis ', ' cognitive neuroscience ', ' Impairment ', ' Affective ', ' data structure ', ' cognitive control ', ' public health relevance ', ' multimodality ', ' effective intervention ', ' treatment strategy ', ' neural patterning ', ' prevent aggression ', ' aggression prevention ', ' Secure ', ' RDoC ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' anti-social behavior ', ' antisocial behavior ', ' trait impulsivity ', ' Preventative measure ', ' Preventive measure ', ' Preventative treatment ', ' Preventive treatment ', ' symptomatology ', ' ']",NIMH,THE MIND RESEARCH NETWORK,R01,2018,754642,NM-01,0.04988499371777869
"Dual Mechanisms of Cognitive Control This project focuses on understanding the psychological and neural mechanisms that give rise to cognitive control. Cognitive control processes are a component of human mental function that is fundamentally important in a wide range of domains, including attention, working memory, episodic memory, and decision making. Cognitive control disruptions are thought to be a major source of functional impairment for individuals suffering from a variety of mental health disorders and neuropsychiatric diseases, which is why they feature prominently in the NIMH RDoC matrix. Over the last decade, we have developed a theoretically coherent and mechanistic model, the Dual Mechanisms of Control (DMC) framework, which has the following core tenets: 1) cognitive control can operate in distinct modes, proactive and reactive; 2) these modes are associated with unique dynamic neural signatures, involving a shift between sustained and transient engagement of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and its interactions with the cingulo-opercular network (CON) and fronto-striatal circuitry; 3) they represent a core dimension of variability, present across a range of cognitive domains (i.e., indicating a psychologically coherent construct); 4) this variability is both state-related (and thus affected by task/situation and endogenous factors) and trait-related (a key component of individual variation); and 5) the variation encompasses cognitive control function in healthy young adults, but also in more extreme forms, contributes to dysfunction present in various impaired populations (e.g., schizophrenia, depression, ADHD, aging). Under a current MERIT award, we have been directly testing these core tenets of the DMC framework, through a large-scale project, which samples monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs and participants from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and to comprehensively characterize proactive and reactive control at the behavioral, neural, and genetic levels. The current proposal takes full advantage of the extensive infrastructure we have already developed for this project to dramatically expand its scope, explanatory depth, and utility to the scientific community. Specifically, we propose a rigorous, multi-pronged study, that integrates our optimized cognitive control task battery with mindfulness skills training (MT), a longitudinal design with repeated neuroimaging assessments, comprehensive “neuro-psychometric” characterization of individual variation utilizing state-of-the-art analytic techniques, and incorporation of current best practices (i.e., following Open Science Framework [OSF] recommendations), to maximize the transparency, reproducibility, and ease of dissemination of project tools and findings. Success is in this effort will have important theoretical and clinical implications, by providing a clearer understanding of the sources of normal human variation, and even more importantly, highlighting potential risk vulnerability factors for a range of mental health disorders. This project will provide detailed information regarding the brain-basis of normal human variation in higher mental functions such as attention, memory and decision-making, and how such functions are impacted by positive lifestyle interventions (i.e., mindfulness training). This information has high relevance for public health by furthering our understanding of the relationship between mental health and illness (e.g.,  schizophrenia, depression) and of the vulnerability and protective factors that contribute to mental illness risk.",Dual Mechanisms of Cognitive Control,9763012,R37MH066078,"['Affect ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Attention ', ' Award ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Communities ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' striatal ', ' Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Decision Making ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Insula of Reil ', ' Island of Reil ', ' Insula ', ' Central Lobe ', ' Memory ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' working memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Parkinsons disease ', "" Parkinson's disease "", "" Parkinson's "", ' Parkinson ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Recommendation ', ' Risk ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Standardization ', ' Task Performances ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Twin Multiple Birth ', ' Twins ', ' Monozygotic twins ', ' Identical Twins ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' analytical method ', ' Anterior ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Nonlinear Dynamic ', ' Non-linear Dynamics ', ' Non-linear Dynamic ', ' Nonlinear Dynamics ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Dimensions ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' Equation ', ' skills training ', ' Episodic memory ', ' success ', ' cingulate cortex ', ' neuroregulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neural regulation ', ' neural control ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' trait ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' neural circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' functional disability ', ' Functional impairment ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Hyperactivity Disorder NOS ', ' ADHD ', ' AD/HD ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' Cognitive ', ' Endogenous Factors ', ' Scheme ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' improved functioning ', ' psychological outcomes ', ' Population ', ' Individual Differences ', ' neural mechanism ', ' neuromechanism ', ' life style intervention ', ' lifestyle intervention ', ' Impairment ', ' cognitive control ', ' public health relevance ', ' mindfulness ', ' cognitive enhancement ', ' longitudinal design ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' RDoC ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' mental function ', ' causal diagram ', ' causal model ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' project dissemination ', ' program dissemination ', ' dynamical system ', ' dynamic system ', ' open-source data ', ' open science ', ' open data ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' connectome ', ' Mindfulness-based Treatment ', ' Mindfulness-based Training ', ' Mindfulness-based Therapy ', ' Mindfulness-based Approach ', ' Mindfulness Treatment ', ' Mindfulness Therapy ', ' Mindfulness Approach ', ' Mindfulness Training ', ' protective factors ', ' individual variability ', ' individual heterogeneity ', ' individual variation ', ' ']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R37,2018,107253,MO-01,0.17623689524690767
"The Center for Neuroscience-based Mental Health Assessment and Prediction (NEUROMAP) Project Summary Mood and anxiety disorders will account for approximately $16 x 109 lost productivity or 25% of global GDP over the next 20 years.

"Integrative Learning to Combine Evidence for Personalized Treatment Strategies. Project Summary:  Mental disorders represent immense healthcare burdens. Intense efforts and resources have been devoted to developing pharmacological and behavioral treatments for mental disorders, but no universally effective treatments are available. Considerable heterogeneity exists in treatment response among individuals with mental disorders, in part because an individual patient's psychosocial characteristics and/or biomarkers are not accounted for when selecting among available treatment options. Barriers to implement personalized treatments in clinical psychiatry include a lack of evidence-based, clinically interpretable, individualized treatment rules (ITRs), a lack of power to detect treatment modiﬁers from a single study, and a lack of reproducibility for treatment rules estimated from single studies. We propose analytic solutions to tackle these barriers. Speciﬁcally, we will provide integrative machine learning methods to build powerful, yet interpretable, individualized treatment strategies that can be easily applied in clinical practice. We will integrate evidence of ITRs identiﬁed in multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to increase robustness and reproducibility. In Aim 1, we will provide piece-wise linear decision trees that are trans- parent, interpretable, and that have guaranteed performance. Our decision trees will simultaneously identify the optimal treatment for a given patient (qualitative interaction) and subgroups of patients with large beneﬁt (quan- titative interaction). In Aim 2, we propose a novel integrative analysis to synthesize evidence across trials and provide an integrative ITR that improves efﬁciency and reproducibility. Our method does not require all studies to collect common sets of variables and thus allows evidence to be combined from ITRs identiﬁed in recent RCTs that collected emerging biomarkers (e.g., neuroimaging measures) with earlier RCTs that focused on clinical and be- havioral markers. In response to the National Institute of Mental Health Strategic Plan on Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) to center mental health research around “dimensional psychological constructs” shared across disorders, the methods will be applied to a wide range of RCTs that recruited patients with major depressive disorder and other co-morbid mental disorders. This strategy allows examination of ITRs for constructs shared across disorders and will increase generalizability. We will apply our methods to various RCTs, including data available from the Na- tional Database for Clinical Trials Related to Mental Illness. This research will bridge approaches for personalized medicine and integrative analysis in an effort to better understand the complex interplay between biomarkers and clinical manifestations in the context of selecting the best treatments for patients with mental disorders. Project Narrative:  Treatment responses for mental disorders are inadequate and considerable heterogeneity is observed, in part because an individual patient's clinical, psychosocial, and/or biological markers are not accounted for when select- ing treatments among available options.

"Improved tailoring of depression care using customized clinical decision support PROJECT SUMMARY Treatments for mental health conditions such as unipolar depression provide modest average benefit but have wide variation between individuals and within individuals over time. Evidence-based customized treatment protocols would improve the mental health care of many people by providing treatment recommendations for individuals that take into account potential variation because of personal characteristics such as current health status, symptoms, and response to earlier treatment. Generating customized treatment protocols requires large amounts of data, such as from networks of health systems that can link electronic health records from millions of individuals. Current statistical approaches for discovering customized treatment protocols are limited in three important ways.  First, current approaches rely on scientists to select the patient characteristics to use to customize treatments instead of using data to find the patient characteristics that will lead to improved, customized care. Second, customized treatment protocols discovered with current statistical methods assume no unobserved differences between individuals who receive various treatment options. Third, investigators do not have ways to know if the available data contain enough information to discover and compare customized treatment protocols precisely enough to make clinical decisions. We will address these three limitations by developing new statistical tools for discovering customized treatment protocols using electronic health records data. Our research team has expertise and experience in statistics, epidemiology, and mental health care. We will integrate methods that have been successfully used in other settings to improve statistical approaches for discovering customized treatment protocols and address these three important limitations.  We will extend machine learning tools for selecting important pieces of information to the time-varying data structure required for discovering customized treatment protocols. We will build approaches that use available knowledge about the size of unobserved differences between groups of people who received different treatments to assess how those differences change study results. By building on the math used to estimate the sample sizes needed for precision in randomized trials with complex designs, we will develop new formulas for determining how many people with a particular condition and who took a particular drug are needed in a health system to provide enough accurate information to discover customized treatment protocols.  Using data from the electronic health records of more than 15,000 patients, we will discover customized treatment protocols for depression. By improving statistical tools and addressing current limitations, our customized treatment protocols will have immediate impact for people living with unipolar depression. The statistical tools we develop will also be useful for discovering customized treatment protocols for people with a wide variety of mental health conditions. PROJECT NARRATIVE People living with mental health conditions and their health care providers often lack evidence for making choices about numerous treatment options and they do not have evidence-based, customized treatment plans. This project will develop customized treatment plans for unipolar depression and methods to generate these plans using data from electronic health care records. This work will address current limitations in statistical methods for selecting patient characteristics for customizing treatment, assessing bias from differences between people who take different medications, and calculating how many people are needed to accurately compare customized treatment plans using data from electronic health records.",Improved tailoring of depression care using customized clinical decision support,9593316,R01MH114873,"['Antidepressive Agents ', ' anti-depressive agents ', ' anti-depressants ', ' anti-depressant drugs ', ' anti-depressant agent ', ' Antidepressants ', ' Antidepressant Drugs ', ' Antidepressant Agent ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Communities ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Patients ', ' Psychotherapy ', ' Recommendation ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' statistics ', ' Time ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Unipolar Depression ', ' Work ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Selection for Treatments ', ' therapy selection ', ' Treatment Effectiveness ', ' Caring ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Sample Size ', ' Funding ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' treatment planning ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' response ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Sequential Treatment ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' electronic data ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' thirteen years of age ', ' thirteen year old ', ' age 13 years ', ' 13 years of age ', ' 13 year old ', ' early therapy ', ' Early treatment ', ' data structure ', ' evidence base ', ' treatment strategy ', ' Randomization trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' precision medicine ', ' unique treatment ', ' tailored treatment ', ' tailored therapy ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' individualized treatment ', ' individualized therapy ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' customized treatment ', ' customized therapy ', ' individualized medicine ', ' individual patient ', ' data resource ', ' primary care provider ', ' care providers ', ' practice setting ', ' clinical decision support ', ' clinical implementation ', ' ']",NIMH,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2018,390422,CA-13,0.08704736640176777
"Dual Mechanisms of Cognitive Control This project focuses on understanding the psychological and neural mechanisms that give rise to cognitive control. Cognitive control processes are a component of human mental function that is fundamentally important in a wide range of domains, including attention, working memory, episodic memory, and decision making. Cognitive control disruptions are thought to be a major source of functional impairment for individuals suffering from a variety of mental health disorders and neuropsychiatric diseases, which is why they feature prominently in the NIMH RDoC matrix. Over the last decade, we have developed a theoretically coherent and mechanistic model, the Dual Mechanisms of Control (DMC) framework, which has the following core tenets: 1) cognitive control can operate in distinct modes, proactive and reactive; 2) these modes are associated with unique dynamic neural signatures, involving a shift between sustained and transient engagement of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and its interactions with the cingulo-opercular network (CON) and fronto-striatal circuitry; 3) they represent a core dimension of variability, present across a range of cognitive domains (i.e., indicating a psychologically coherent construct); 4) this variability is both state-related (and thus affected by task/situation and endogenous factors) and trait-related (a key component of individual variation); and 5) the variation encompasses cognitive control function in healthy young adults, but also in more extreme forms, contributes to dysfunction present in various impaired populations (e.g., schizophrenia, depression, ADHD, aging). Under a current MERIT award, we have been directly testing these core tenets of the DMC framework, through a large-scale project, which samples monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs and participants from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and to comprehensively characterize proactive and reactive control at the behavioral, neural, and genetic levels. The current proposal takes full advantage of the extensive infrastructure we have already developed for this project to dramatically expand its scope, explanatory depth, and utility to the scientific community. Specifically, we propose a rigorous, multi-pronged study, that integrates our optimized cognitive control task battery with mindfulness skills training (MT), a longitudinal design with repeated neuroimaging assessments, comprehensive “neuro-psychometric” characterization of individual variation utilizing state-of-the-art analytic techniques, and incorporation of current best practices (i.e., following Open Science Framework [OSF] recommendations), to maximize the transparency, reproducibility, and ease of dissemination of project tools and findings. Success is in this effort will have important theoretical and clinical implications, by providing a clearer understanding of the sources of normal human variation, and even more importantly, highlighting potential risk vulnerability factors for a range of mental health disorders. This project will provide detailed information regarding the brain-basis of normal human variation in higher mental functions such as attention, memory and decision-making, and how such functions are impacted by positive lifestyle interventions (i.e., mindfulness training). This information has high relevance for public health by furthering our understanding of the relationship between mental health and illness (e.g.,  schizophrenia, depression) and of the vulnerability and protective factors that contribute to mental illness risk.",Dual Mechanisms of Cognitive Control,9685247,R37MH066078,"['Affect ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Attention ', ' Award ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Communities ', ' striatal ', ' Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' Decision Making ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Island of Reil ', ' Insula ', ' Central Lobe ', ' Insula of Reil ', ' Memory ', ' working memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Parkinsons disease ', "" Parkinson's disease "", "" Parkinson's "", ' Parkinson ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Recommendation ', ' Risk ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Standardization ', ' Task Performances ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Twins ', ' Twin Multiple Birth ', ' Identical Twins ', ' Monozygotic twins ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' analytical method ', ' Anterior ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Nonlinear Dynamics ', ' Nonlinear Dynamic ', ' Non-linear Dynamics ', ' Non-linear Dynamic ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' Functional disorder ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Dimensions ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' Equation ', ' skills training ', ' Episodic memory ', ' success ', ' cingulate cortex ', ' neuroregulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neural regulation ', ' neural control ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' neural circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' functional disability ', ' Functional impairment ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Hyperactivity Disorder NOS ', ' ADHD ', ' AD/HD ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' Cognitive ', ' Endogenous Factors ', ' Scheme ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' improved functioning ', ' psychological outcomes ', ' Population ', ' Individual Differences ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' lifestyle intervention ', ' life style intervention ', ' Impairment ', ' cognitive control ', ' public health relevance ', ' mindfulness ', ' cognitive enhancement ', ' longitudinal design ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' RDoC ', ' mental function ', ' causal model ', ' causal diagram ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' program dissemination ', ' project dissemination ', ' dynamic system ', ' dynamical system ', ' open data ', ' open-source data ', ' open science ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' connectome ', ' Mindfulness Training ', ' Mindfulness-based Treatment ', ' Mindfulness-based Training ', ' Mindfulness-based Therapy ', ' Mindfulness-based Approach ', ' Mindfulness Treatment ', ' Mindfulness Therapy ', ' Mindfulness Approach ', ' protective factors ', ' individual variation ', ' individual variability ', ' individual heterogeneity ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R37,2019,714063,MO-01,0.17623689524690767
"Impact of Telemedicine on Medicare Beneficiaries with Mental Illness PROJECT SUMMARY Access to mental health specialists is difficult for many patients in the U.S., particularly for the poor and those who live in rural communities. Telemental health is one potential solution for this access problem, and there has been rapid growth in the number of live video-based telemental health visits in the U.S. While there are numerous rigorous randomized-control trials comparing telemental health visits to in-person mental health specialist care, there have been little research on how telemental health is being used in real-world settings. The uptake of telemental health has been very uneven geographically, and what explains this variation is also largely unknown. Our mixed-methods proposal centers on filling these gaps in knowledge. Under the first aim, we will conduct a series of descriptive analyses of data on 75 million adults with Medicare or commercial insurance to understand how telemental health is being used in conjunction with in-person care and whether the growth of telemental health has decreased disparities in the use of mental health specialists among disadvantaged populations. Under the second aim, we seek to explain why there is geographic variation in uptake using robust statistical machine learning. Under the third aim, we exploit the variation in uptake to assess whether communities with greater telemental health penetration have experienced improvements in care for patients with mental illness. In the fourth aim we will conduct qualitative interviews with providers to complement the empirical analyses and understand the key contextual factors underlying our findings. Understanding how telemental health is being used, why there is variation in use of telemental health, and whether telemental health use is associated with higher quality care could help drive future telemental health interventions and influence the ongoing policy debate on telemedicine regulations and reimbursement. Together the results of these aims are consistent with the NIMH's expressed interest in innovative delivery models that can improve care for underserved communities. It is difficult for many patients with mental illness to access care from a mental health specialist. Telemental health is one way to potentially help these patients receive care and the number of such visits for mental illness has increased rapidly. In this project, we will study how telemental health is being used to care for patients with mental illness, what drives variation in use, and whether telemedicine is associated with receipt of higher quality care.",Impact of Telemedicine on Medicare Beneficiaries with Mental Illness,9600712,R01MH112829,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' meeting reports ', ' Congresses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Diffusion ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Geography ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' individuals with disabilities ', ' disabled people ', ' disabled individual ', ' disabled ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Handicapped ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' Health ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment access ', ' service availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Insurance ', ' Interview ', ' Laws ', ' Literature ', ' Medicaid ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' Patients ', ' psychotic illness ', ' Psychoses ', ' Psychotic Disorders ', ' Research ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Specialty ', ' medical specialties ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' Rural Community ', ' Specialist ', ' Caring ', ' Telemedicine ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' rural region ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Penetration ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Series ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' Rural ', ' Policies ', ' uptake ', ' Internet ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Pattern ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' experience ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' geographic variation ', ' geographic difference ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' trend ', ' beneficiary ', ' medication compliance ', ' medication adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' rapid growth ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' severe mental illness ', ' severe mental disorder ', ' serious mental illness ', ' serious mental disorder ', ' persistent mental illness ', ' chronic mental illness ', ' older patient ', ' elderly patient ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' trial comparing ', ' demographics ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' control trial ', ' population health ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' improved outcome ', ' disadvantaged population ', ' Telemental ', ' care costs ', ' ']",NIMH,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2019,734746,MA-07,0.22129102099471107
"Measuring the role of mental model complexity on individual behavioral and neural differences in adaptive decision making PROJECT SUMMARY To make good decisions in uncertain environments, humans build and update ‘mental models’ of relevant environmental statistics that can be used to make predictions and guide decision-making. When the environment changes, these models need to be adaptable to retain their predictiveness. This kind of adaptability typically involves key information-processing trade-offs that are well understood theoretically but have yet to be applied substantially to our understanding of human brain function and behavior. Here I examine systematically how these trade-offs, measured both from behavior and brain-imaging data, relate to the considerable variability in decision-making abilities that are typically evident across subjects and task conditions. My focus on behavioral, computational, and neural mechanisms of individual variability in decision-making abilities is particularly relevant to long-term research in mental health. Decision-making is severely disrupted in a number of mental illnesses including anxiety, schizophrenia, and addictive behaviors, but the exact mechanisms underlying these disruptions have yet to be fully elucidated. My central hypothesis is that individual and task-dependent differences in adaptive decision-making reflect systematic variability in the complexity of the mental models upon which the decisions are based. In the fields of statistics and machine learning, predictive models compress past observations into representations that can generalize to the future. A model’s complexity determines the flexibility with which this compression can account for new information. Complex models are more adaptive (low bias) but can overfit spurious observations, leading to more behavioral variability. In contrast, simpler models tend to have higher bias but lower variability. This tradeoff between bias and variance is well described in statistics and machine learning, but its influence on human mental models and decision-making behavior is not well known. The two primary aims of this project are: 1) to develop a principled measure of mental complexity that can be applied to human behavioral data; and 2) to identify the influence of mental model complexity on neuromodulatory brain networks involved in the mental exploration required for adaptive decision-making, and how activity in these networks differs across individuals. By linking a strong theoretical framework with methods from information theory, psychology, neuroscience, and computational modeling, the current proposal will provide a novel lens with which to examine behavioral and neurobiological sources of individual variability in human decision-making. Moreover, the results of this research will provide crucial insights for interventions aimed at understanding and improving decision-making processes affected by mental illnesses. PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite the importance of adaptive behavior in our everyday lives, there are substantial gaps in our understanding of why adaptive processes differ between healthy individuals and how mental illnesses disrupt these processes. I propose that the ‘complexity’ of the mental models people use to interact with an environment accounts for many of these individual differences, with more complex mental models leading to ‘overthinking’ while learning, whereas less complex models to ‘oversimplify’ what needs to be learned. The goals of this study are to test the novel hypothesis that mental model complexity accounts for substantial individual differences in adaptive learning, and identify the neuromodulatory brain networks underlying these differences.",Measuring the role of mental model complexity on individual behavioral and neural differences in adaptive decision making,9758624,F32MH117924,"['Affect ', ' Anxiety ', ' Arousal ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Decision Making ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Information Theory ', ' Island of Reil ', ' Insula ', ' Central Lobe ', ' Insula of Reil ', ' Learning ', ' blue nucleus ', ' Nucleus Pigmentosus Pontis ', ' Locus Coeruleus ', ' locus ceruleus structure ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurobiology ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Noise ', ' Noradrenaline ', ' Levonorepinephrine ', ' Levarterenol ', ' Norepinephrine ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Psychology ', ' Pupil ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Training Programs ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Addictive Behavior ', ' adaptive behavior ', ' adaptation behavior ', ' Adaptive Behaviors ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Anterior ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Link ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' field study ', ' field test ', ' field learning ', ' field based data ', ' neuroregulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neural regulation ', ' neural control ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Diameter ', ' Caliber ', ' Data ', ' Research Training ', ' Cognitive ', ' Update ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' Individual Differences ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' Impairment ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' norepinephrine system ', ' NE system ', ' lens ', ' lenses ', ' information processing ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' behavioral response ', ' behavior response ', ' adaptive learning ', ' individual variation ', ' individual variability ', ' individual heterogeneity ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F32,2019,61226,PA-03,0.14553157161976166
"Bioinformatics for post-traumatic stress Project Summary/Abstract Maladaptive complications following trauma, including post-traumatic stress (PTS), are highly prevalent in both veterans and civilians, and have been difficult to accurately diagnose, manage and treat. Debate regarding diagnostic criteria and the need to represent the full spectrum of inter-connected features contributing to psychopathology has spawned the development of the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). RDoC is a developing framework to help guide the discovery and validation of new dimensions of mental health disorders and their relationships to underlying biological mechanisms. NIMH now has a rich federated database that currently houses raw data from RDoC-sponsored clinical research, and clinical trial data from the National Database of Clinical Trials (NDCT) with information that may help to unlock the complex and overlapping relationships between symptoms of PTS and the underlying biomarkers to fuel improvements on diagnostic and therapeutic frameworks for trauma recovery. The proposed project will apply bioinformatics and machine learning analytical tools to these large, heterogeneous datasets to identify and validate new research dimensions of trauma-related psychopathology and treatment response trajectories and their predictors. Aim 1 will develop an in silico trauma patient population by integrating data from diverse sources, including cross-sectional and observational longitudinal clinical studies housed within available data repositories for trauma and other related mental health research. Data will include medical history, demographics, diagnostic tests, clinical outcomes, psychological assessments, genomics, imaging, and other relevant study and meta-data. Aim 2 will identify multiple dimensions of PTS diagnostic criteria, using a combination of unsupervised dimension-reduction statistical methods, internal and external cross-validation, and supervised hypothesis testing of predictive models to understand the heterogeneous subtypes of PTS. Aim 3 will deploy unsupervised machine learning methods, such as topological data analysis and hierarchical clustering, to identify unique clusters of patients based on symptomatology to develop clustering methods for precision mapping of PTS patients based on disease severity. Aim 4 will use supervised machine learning techniques for targeted predictive analytics focused on identifying treatment responders from the NDCT, and identification of latent variables that predict treatment response. The results of the proposed research project will greatly enrich the field of computational psychiatry research to identify conserved dimensions associated with the complex relationships of psychopathology and precision treatment planning following exposure to traumatic events. Project Narrative A recent restructuring of diagnostic and research criteria for psychiatric disorders has been implemented to promote greater understanding of the biological mechanisms involved in the development of complex mental health disorders. The proposed project aims to apply bioinformatics and machine learning analytics to large datasets from trauma-exposed patients to identify and validate dimensions of post-traumatic stress (PTS),

"MISSION U: A MULTIMEDIA TRAINING TOOL FOR TREATING INDIVIDUALS WITH CO-OCCURRING MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS Co-occurring mental health and substance use disorders (COD) are common in the United States and providers have been challenged to provide effective treatments. As a consequence, their clients with COD may experience poor treatment engagement, symptom exacerbation and cycle in and out of emergency services. This is particularly true for underrepresented populations with a COD including individuals whom are homeless and involved in the criminally justice system. Research shows that integrated and coordinated community- based services for COD can improve client outcomes. However, healthcare workforce has a gap in training staff on such treatment techniques, which we aim to close via this Phase II STTR project.  Maintaining Independence and Sobriety through Systems Integration, Outreach and Networking (MISSION) is a unique evidence-based, trans-disciplinary treatment designed to address the complex needs of individuals with CODs and includes manuals for high risk populations of civilian and veteran homeless individuals as well as those involved in the criminally justice system. Listed in the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration-Registry for Evidence Based Practices (NREPP), MISSION has had substantial impact. The Veterans Health Administration has deployed it in their national plan to end Veteran Homelessness. Massachusetts has used it in its Statewide Plan to End Homelessness and written it into Public Law for delivery alongside Veterans Treatment courts. While MISSION is a manualized treatment, a recent multisite implementation study identified the need for more comprehensive training tools. With NIAAA support, the University of Massachusetts Medical School (MISSION developers) partnered with Praxis on a Phase I STTR to (1) develop the MISSION University online training platform, (2) show proof of concept by implementing two training modules and an e-simulation case study, and (3) conduct a pilot randomized trial which demonstrated that training-as-usual Distance Learning (DL) + Technical Assistance (TA) outperformed TA alone.  In Phase II, we will complete MISSION U by developing and testing five new MISSION modules and companion e-simulations tools that test knowledge acquisition and application. We will first do a formative evaluation with 20 learners who will provide feedback on MISSION U modules. This will be followed by a randomized controlled trial similar to Phase I in which 60 learners will be randomized to the DL or the DL+TA conditions. In preparation for future scalability, we will uniquely conduct a qualitative process evaluation using the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance framework with 42 MISSION U participants to look at facilitators and barriers to implementation. Lastly, we will pilot test machine learning techniques with our 60 individuals who participated in the randomized trial in an effort to help personalize the MISSION U training experience for commercialization. !1 “MISSION U: A Multimedia Training Tool for Treatment of Individuals with Co-occurring Mental Health and Substance Use Disorders” is aimed at training providers of services for these individuals. MISSION U challenges prevailing provider training methodology that relies mainly on on-site provider training and/or online training using typical classroom-type materials. This project not only addresses the growing need for new provider training methodologies, but also offers the promise of improving clinical efficacy and reducing training costs and medical expenditures overall.! !",MISSION U: A MULTIMEDIA TRAINING TOOL FOR TREATING INDIVIDUALS WITH CO-OCCURRING MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS,9774983,R42AA026751,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Assertiveness ', ' Client ', ' lesson plans ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Knowledge acquisition ', ' emergency service ', ' Emergency medical service ', ' England ', ' Expenditure ', ' Feedback ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Laws ', ' Maintenance ', ' Manuals ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Materials Testing ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methodology ', ' National Health Services ', ' Play ', ' Pre-Post Tests ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Testing ', ' training module ', ' Training Activity ', ' Training Programs ', ' United States ', ' Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration ', ' SAMHSA ', ' United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration ', ' Veterans Administration ', ' United States Veterans Administration ', ' United States Department of Veterans Affairs ', ' Universities ', ' Veterans ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Administrator ', ' case report ', ' Case Study ', ' Criminal Justice ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Specialist ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' court ', ' health administration ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Imprisonment ', ' incarceration ', ' incarcerated ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Homelessness ', ' unhoused ', ' homeless ', ' Individual ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' satisfaction ', ' Systems Integration ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Companions ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Multimedia ', ' Multimedium ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Services ', ' suicidal risk ', ' suicide risk ', ' experience ', ' field study ', ' field test ', ' field learning ', ' field based data ', ' computer science ', ' Distance Learning ', ' skills ', ' simulation ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' sobriety ', ' sober ', ' outreach ', ' Case Manager ', ' Case Management Nurse ', ' Care Manager ', ' behavioral health ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Videoconferences ', ' Symptoms ', ' Evidence based practice ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Small Business Technology Transfer Research ', ' STTR ', ' Preparation ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Health Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Instruction ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' clinical efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism ', ' NIAAA ', ' community based service ', ' Evidence based program ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' usability ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' prototype ', ' commercialization ', ' Psychosocial Influences ', ' Psychosocial Issues ', ' evidence base ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' arm ', ' operation ', ' Learning Module ', ' Teaching Module ', ' Educational Module ', ' Education Module ', ' phase I trial ', ' peer support ', ' formative assessment ', ' formative evaluation ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' provider networks ', ' service providers ', ' ']",NIAAA,"PRAXIS, INC.",R42,2019,751223,MA-05,0.05942682809291661
"Integrative Learning to Combine Evidence for Personalized Treatment Strategies. Project Summary:  Mental disorders represent immense healthcare burdens. Intense efforts and resources have been devoted to developing pharmacological and behavioral treatments for mental disorders, but no universally effective treatments are available. Considerable heterogeneity exists in treatment response among individuals with mental disorders, in part because an individual patient's psychosocial characteristics and/or biomarkers are not accounted for when selecting among available treatment options. Barriers to implement personalized treatments in clinical psychiatry include a lack of evidence-based, clinically interpretable, individualized treatment rules (ITRs), a lack of power to detect treatment modifiers from a single study, and a lack of reproducibility for treatment rules estimated from single studies. We propose analytic solutions to tackle these barriers. Specifically, we will provide integrative machine learning methods to build powerful, yet interpretable, individualized treatment strategies that can be easily applied in clinical practice. We will integrate evidence of ITRs identified in multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to increase robustness and reproducibility. In Aim 1, we will provide piece-wise linear decision trees that are  transparent, interpretable, and that have guaranteed performance. Our decision trees will simultaneously identify the optimal treatment for a given patient (qualitative interaction) and subgroups of patients with large benefit  (quantitative interaction). In Aim 2, we propose a novel integrative analysis to synthesize evidence across trials and provide an integrative ITR that improves efficiency and reproducibility. Our method does not require all studies to collect common sets of variables and thus allows evidence to be combined from ITRs identified in recent RCTs that collected emerging biomarkers (e.g., neuroimaging measures) with earlier RCTs that focused on clinical and  behavioral markers. In response to the National Institute of Mental Health Strategic Plan on Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) to center mental health research around “dimensional psychological constructs” shared across disorders, the methods will be applied to a wide range of RCTs that recruited patients with major depressive disorder and other co-morbid mental disorders. This strategy allows examination of ITRs for constructs shared across disorders and will increase generalizability. We will apply our methods to various RCTs, including data available from the  National Database for Clinical Trials Related to Mental Illness. This research will bridge approaches for personalized medicine and integrative analysis in an effort to better understand the complex interplay between biomarkers and clinical manifestations in the context of selecting the best treatments for patients with mental disorders. Project Narrative:  Treatment responses for mental disorders are inadequate and considerable heterogeneity is observed, in part because an individual patient's clinical, psychosocial, and/or biological markers are not accounted for when select- ing treatments among available options.

"Online system for identifying and addressing teen depression in primary care This proposal presents innovations to addressing teen depression during routine check-up visits through further development of an online clinical process support system called CHADIS. The primary care provider remains in the center of the process with his/her prior relationship with the family and humanity enabled with computer assistance prior to the encounter as well as moment of care reminders and teleprompted specific hints aimed at enhancing a patient focused balanced discussion of individual strengths and barriers to the teens goals known as a motivational interview. This is made feasible through pre-visit data collection providing relevant details to highlight as well as data to support omitting some traditional guidance areas with lower priority for the individual teen. Any conclusions coming from PCP recommendations and shared decision making is reinforced by a computer-based, always available chatbot guided by artificial intelligence that serves as a bridge to other helping professionals, strengths building resources, as well as conversations based on proven mental health therapies based on earlier pilot data for reducing depressive symptoms. These innovations will be tested via a cluster randomized control trial, demonstrating whether use of the system results in higher rates of screening, reductions in depressive symptoms, and accessing of evidence-based treatment for teen depression. Use of the system is reinforced by engagement of primary doctors and child psychiatrists in a related quality improvement program with data from their participation providing needed feedback for recertification of professional status requirements of their respective specialty boards. Success of the system would mean a new primary care workflow-friendly tool which could help adolescents avoid the significant functional impairment and increased risks that accompany teen depression. If this new paradigm for adolescent health supervision proves useful for depression, adaptations for other teen challenges might also be promising. Approximately 12.5% of U.S. 12-17 year olds had at least one major depressive episode in the past year 30. Yet, up to 70% of teens with mental health (MH) care needs do not receive necessary care.3 This proposal addresses the significant public health problem of teen depression through use of a comprehensive, process-driven intervention targeting time points before, during, and after routine visits with primary care providers (PCPs) through a new module to an online clinical process support system called CHADIS.",Online system for identifying and addressing teen depression in primary care,9778280,R44MH116751,"['motivational enhancement therapy ', ' motivational interview ', ' Modality ', ' Depression screen ', ' depression screening ', ' Support System ', ' Social Support System ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Interventional trial ', ' behavioral health ', ' functional disability ', ' Functional impairment ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Teenagers ', ' teenage ', ' teen years ', ' Teen ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Depression and Suicide ', ' depression and suicidality ', ' Text ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Feeling ', ' feelings ', ' Health Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Evidence based treatment ', ' child depression ', ' youth depression ', ' pediatric depression ', ' depression in adolescence ', ' depressed adolescents ', ' childhood onset depression ', ' childhood depression ', ' adolescents with depression ', ' adolescent depression ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' 17 year old ', ' seventeen years of age ', ' seventeen year old ', ' age 17 years ', ' 17 years of age ', ' volunteer ', ' control trial ', ' shared decision making ', ' screening ', ' adolescent health ', ' recruit ', ' care providers ', ' primary care provider ', ' barrier to care ', ' obstacle to healthcare ', ' obstacle to care ', ' barrier to treatment ', ' barrier to healthcare ', ' barrier to health care ', ' care coordination ', ' coordinating care ', ' implementation strategy ', ' chatbot ', ' chat bot ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Appointment ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Child Psychiatry ', ' Computers ', ' Data Collection ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Family ', ' Feedback ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' Information Systems ', ' Interview ', ' single episode Major Depression ', ' major depressive episode ', ' Single major depressive episode ', ' Single major depression ', ' single episode major depressive disorder ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Moods ', ' physician office visit ', ' Office Visits ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Psychiatrist ', ' Public Health ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Specialty Boards ', ' Supervision ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Texas ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Specialist ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Training ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Individual ', ' satisfaction ', ' tool ', ' Consensus ', ' Knowledge ', ' Qi ', "" Ch'i "", ' programs ', ' System ', ' Abnormal coordination ', ' Lack of Coordination ', ' Incoordination ', ' Dyscoordination ', ' Coordination Disorder ', ' Co-ordination disorder ', ' Visit ', ' suicidal risk ', ' suicide risk ', ' success ', ' checkup examination ', ' checkup ', ' Check-up ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Agreement ', ' ']",NIMH,"TOTAL CHILD HEALTH, INC.",R44,2019,242854,MD-03,0.060645324161156956
"Developing an Optimized Conversational Agent or ""Chatbot"" to Facilitate Mental Health Services Use in Individuals with Eating Disorders PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Eating disorders (EDs) are serious mental illnesses associated with high morbidity and mortality, clinical impairment, and comorbid psychopathology. Although evidence-based treatments for EDs have been established, the treatment gap is wide. Indeed, <20% of individuals with EDs receive treatment. We need a novel solution not only to identify individuals with EDs but also to encourage mental health services use and address treatment barriers. I have established a strong working relationship with the National EDs Association (NEDA), the U.S.'s leading non-profit for EDs, to offer our group's online, evidence-based EDs screen on the NEDA website. Over one year, the NEDA screen was completed >200,000 times. Among screen respondents, the vast majority screen positive for an ED, but of those, most are not in treatment, and only a small percentage click to learn more about one of the options for seeking intervention presented in the screening feedback. I propose a research agenda to design a conversational agent or “chatbot” that is optimized to increase mental health services use among individuals with EDs through such features as: 1) providing a personalized recommendation for seeking intervention; 2) engaging the user in motivational interviewing to overcome barriers to care; and 3) repeated check-ins with the user to encourage follow-up with care. This research agenda aligns with NIMH's focus on services research and interest in technology-driven approaches to promote engagement with care. I will conduct two studies. First, I will utilize a user-centered design approach to create a prototype chatbot and conduct usability testing with adults with EDs to inform chatbot refinements (Aim 1). Second, I will conduct a randomized optimization trial with adults who have completed screening on the NEDA website and screen positive for an ED but are not in treatment to determine chatbot feasibility and to generate data on the effect of the chatbot on motivation for treatment post-initial chatbot use and motivation for treatment and mental health services use at 1- and 3-month follow-ups (Aims 2 & 3). This trial will employ the Multiphase Optimization Strategy framework, using a 23 full factorial design, to randomly assign participants to a combination of the three proposed intervention components (n=8 conditions) to isolate the active ingredients. These aims support my training plan in which I will receive expert mentorship and training in: services research and implementation science (Training Goal 1); user-centered design and usability testing, as well as exposure to machine learning (Training Goal 2); novel trial designs (Training Goal 3); and advanced statistical techniques for analyzing longitudinal trial and digital innovation data (Training Goal 4). My expert mentorship team, along with the environment of Washington University, will ensure my success. Results from the proposed study will be used to optimize the chatbot, which I will then test in a subsequent R01 randomized controlled trial. This K08 will equip me with the skills to become a leader in addressing the research-practice and treatment gaps for EDs, with a focus on digital innovations. PROJECT NARRATIVE Eating disorders are serious mental illnesses, but less than 20% of individuals receive treatment. I propose a research agenda to design a conversational agent or “chatbot” for increasing mental health services use among individuals with eating disorders, with study data being used to optimize the chatbot for a subsequent R01 randomized controlled trial. This K08 will not only result in the development of a highly scalable solution for facilitating mental health services use among individuals with eating disorders that has potential for widespread dissemination through partnership with the National Eating Disorders Association, but it will also result in an independent research program that addresses critical gaps in the treatment of eating disorders, with a focus on digital innovation solutions.","Developing an Optimized Conversational Agent or ""Chatbot"" to Facilitate Mental Health Services Use in Individuals with Eating Disorders",9806002,K08MH120341,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' computer programming ', ' computer program ', ' Eating Disorders ', ' Environment ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' treatment access ', ' service availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Services Research ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Learning ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mentorship ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Motivation ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' Partnership Practice ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' Recommendation ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Support ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Work ', ' Caring ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Respondent ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Exposure to ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' motivational interview ', ' Health Technology ', ' Healthcare Technology ', ' Health Care Technology ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Investigational Therapies ', ' experimental therapeutics ', ' experimental therapeutic agents ', ' Investigational Treatments ', ' Experimental Therapies ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Evidence based treatment ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' severe mental illness ', ' severe mental disorder ', ' serious mental illness ', ' serious mental disorder ', ' persistent mental illness ', ' chronic mental illness ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Impairment ', ' user centered design ', ' usability ', ' implementation science ', ' prototype ', ' evidence base ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' screening ', ' personalized intervention ', ' precision interventions ', ' trial design ', ' health service use ', ' health service utilization ', ' Text Messaging ', ' texting ', ' short message service ', ' barrier to care ', ' obstacle to healthcare ', ' obstacle to care ', ' barrier to treatment ', ' barrier to healthcare ', ' barrier to health care ', ' service delivery ', ' Facebook ', ' chatbot ', ' chat bot ', ' ']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K08,2019,179096,MO-01,0.11131000413118862
"Ethical, Legal and Social Implications in the Use of Digital Technology for Mental Health Applications Digital mental health technology (DMHT) –digital devices (smartphones, sensors) that can monitor and collect personal data from patients (tracking location/voice/motion, self-report), apply algorithms and machine learning (“ML”) to generate and integrate health and risk information (from genomics/family history), and even mediate care (monitoring treatment adherence or chatbot therapy)– is being integrated into mental health clinical care, with the goal of improving access, diagnostics and treatment for mental illness.

The goals of the project are to: (1) examine how key stakeholders – DMHT developers, clinicians and patients – conceptualize and operationalize the ethical, legal and social implications of DMHT as it is translated into clinical care; and (2) use qualitative and quantitative methods to interview and survey clinicians, patients and consumers who use DMHT to examine the ethical, legal and social implications of the technology, particularly in relation to trust, privacy, data protection and management, and surveillance; and (3) provide improved understandings of how developers, patients, and clinicians perceive and manage ethical, legal and social implications of DMHT, that can be used as a foundation for further research and to provide guidance for ethical and safe use of digital technology in mental health care.","Ethical, Legal and Social Implications in the Use of Digital Technology for Mental Health Applications",9821661,K01MH118375,"['Adoption ', ' Algorithms ', ' Attention ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Communication ', ' Cultural Backgrounds ', ' ethical ', ' Ethics ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' treatment access ', ' service availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Informed Consent ', ' Interview ', ' Judgment ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Motion ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' psychotic illness ', ' Psychoses ', ' Psychotic Disorders ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Scholarship ', ' Social Policies ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Technology ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Voice ', ' Accountability ', ' Privacy ', ' Data Protection ', ' Ethical Issues ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Mediating ', ' Psychotic Mood Disorders ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Training ', ' Trust ', ' uptake ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Empirical Research ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Dimensions ', ' Location ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' age group ', ' data management ', ' experience ', ' computer science ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Categories ', ' Devices ', ' Health Technology ', ' Healthcare Technology ', ' Health Care Technology ', ' behavioral health ', ' Genomics ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Monitor ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' Behavioral ', ' ethical legal social implication ', ' ethical, legal, and social ', ' Behavior monitoring ', ' behavioral monitoring ', ' digital ', ' health application ', ' neurotechnology ', ' clinical care ', ' community setting ', ' treatment adherence ', ' risk minimization ', ' health information technology ', ' social implication ', ' mHealth ', ' mobile health ', ' m-Health ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' health data ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subtypes ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subgroups ', ' dashboard ', ' chatbot ', ' chat bot ', ' ']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2019,126897,CA-18,0.18574664661284038
"Deep machine learning to delineate trajectories of vulnerability and transition to mental illness in youth Most mental illness originates in youth: 50% of mental illness is diagnosed by the age of 14, and 75% by 24. Manifest illness emerges after a period of ~8-10 years. Remarkably, functional MRI can detect disrupted patterns of brain function associated with these vulnerable trajectories. However, the emergence of manifest mental illness reflects a complex and dynamic interplay of many biological, developmental, social and environmental factors that may be risky or protective, shared across illness categories, co-vary, and currently lack specificity. Moreover, the ability of fMRI and serial assessment to detect clinically-relevant shifts in dynamic risk trajectories of mental illness is poorly defined. Charting mental illness trajectories to optimize intervention is a critical need. A major obstacle is the identification of specific neural-behavioral risk pathways that shape vulnerable developmental trajectories into various categories of manifest mental illness. The long-term goal of my research is to develop computational approaches to advance our understanding of risk trajectories in the mental health of youth. Consequently, the overall objective of this study is to leverage advanced machine learning methods to illuminate dynamic trajectories of mental illness progression, to characterize sustained mental health and to quantify the incremental predictive value of serial and functional MRI assessment. My central hypothesis is that specific risk pathways that have specific brain functional correlates characterize discrete peri-adolescent trajectories in major mental illness categories. Further, that functional MRI metrics and serial assessment significantly improve case prediction. This study will leverage a new, unprecedented opportunity to dissect risk trajectories by applying deep machine learning to ‘big data’ from 20,000 diverse youth, including longitudinal data. I will characterize the behavior and specificity of dynamic risk trajectories and their functional neural correlates in 5 major peri-adolescent mental illness categories and determine the incremental predictive value of adding functional MRI to bio-psycho-social data and continuing assessment after age 10, the developmental inflection point for mental illness. Further innovation will accrue from the use of a cloud computing infrastructure to perform the research. My rationale is that elucidating specific risk trajectories and how to best monitor them in peri-adolescence will stimulate more refined prevention and early intervention strategies in youth mental health, known to improve outcomes and reduce resource use. Concomitantly, I will obtain capstone training in advanced machine learning methods, programming and cloud computing infrastructure, building on my KL2 training in machine learning, data science and the acquisition and analysis of fMRI and bio-psycho-social data. An interdisciplinary mentorship team of international experts in data science, developmental psychopathology, bioinformatics, epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of Washington will prepare me for my transition to independence as a physician-scientist working at the interface of computational science and population youth mental health, and as a child and adolescent psychiatrist specializing in neurodevelopmental disorders. Charting mental illness trajectories in community populations of diverse youth to optimize early intervention is a critical need in population mental health. The goal of this study is to leverage advanced machine learning methods in unique, new ‘big data’ from 20,000 diverse youth to illuminate dynamic trajectories of mental illness progression, to characterize sustained mental health and to quantify the incremental predictive value of serial and functional MRI assessment. The resulting body of work will elucidate specific dynamic risk trajectories and suggest how to monitor them in peri-adolescence and stimulate more refined prevention and early intervention strategies in youth mental health, known to improve outcomes and reduce resource use. !",Deep machine learning to delineate trajectories of vulnerability and transition to mental illness in youth,9820438,K99MH118359,"['abstracting ', ' Activities of Daily Living ', ' functional capacity ', ' functional ability ', ' daily living functionality ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Goals ', ' Incidence ', ' longterm study ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mentorship ', ' Physicians ', ' Psychiatrist ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Artifacts ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Shapes ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Pattern ', ' psychosocial ', ' Performance ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Categories ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' social ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Psychosocial Assessment and Care ', ' psychosocial support ', ' psychosocial studies ', ' psychosocial care ', ' psychosocial assessment ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Cognitive ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Neurodevelopmental Disorder ', ' Neurological Development Disorder ', ' Behavioral ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' Computational Science ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' 10 year old ', ' ten years of age ', ' ten year old ', ' age 10 years ', ' 10 years of age ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' high risk ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' Cloud Computing ', ' cloud computer ', ' Cloud Infrastructure ', ' Major Mental Illness ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' neural correlate ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' Data Science ', ' improved outcome ', ' symptom cluster ', ' artificial neural network ', ' synthetic neural network ', ' computational neural network ', ' artificial neural net ', ' deep learning ', ' Infrastructure ', ' periadolescent ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K99,2019,157009,WA-07,0.1343066082039882
"Laboratory for Early Psychosis Research (LEAP) 1. Abstract We propose to create a NIMH P50 ALACRITY Center that develops the collaborations, data systems, and methods necessary to form a state-wide Laboratory for Early Psychosis Research, aka the LEAP Center. While recent trial evidence suggests great promise for coordinated specialty care (CSC) for patients with first episode psychosis (FEP), there remain several gaps in the knowledge base for the care of psychosis in general. Now is an ideal time to address these gaps because of recent policy changes enhancing FEP care financing, practice changes in the field, and methods developed outside of mental health. To create this Center, we will start with interdisciplinary collaborations between CSC clinics in Massachusetts, policy makers/regulators, and stakeholders, and include FEP experts from across the country plus scientific experts from outside of mental health, e.g., in data science, machine learning, epidemiology, and health policy. We also will leverage recent Massachusetts efforts to mandate, standardized, and support data collection on FEP care structures, delivery, and outcomes from all FEP clinics within the state. We also will apply and develop modern methods for clinical prediction and comparative effectiveness research (CER), e.g., machine learning and g-methods, for FEP research. Accordingly, we have three overall Center aims: 1) Collaborations; 2) Data systems; and 3) Prediction and CER methods. The Center will start with three foundational and complementary projects: 1) Using the state All Payer Claims Database (APCD), Project 1 will apply a population-level approach to examine which patients receive care in FEP clinics offering CSC versus elsewhere, as the number of clinics increases, then estimate the treatment effect on unfavorable clinical event rates such as hospitalizations; 2) Project 2 will review the data collected by the state from all of the FEP clinics, assess and improve data collection quality, validate measures, and integrate perspectives; and 3) Project 3 will define clusters of patients using longitudinal outcome data (i.e., begin to unpack the amount of clinical heterogeneity), predict the cluster type for individual patients, and examine the impact of CSC treatment accounting for this clinical heterogeneity. The Administrative Core and Methods Core (Prediction and CER) bind these projects together. The Center will include a group of Scientific Advisors from across North America, Center Faculty from diverse scientific disciplines, including those that historically have had little exposure in mental health research, and Stakeholders, including policy makers, organizational decision makers, and patient and family advocates.

"Improved tailoring of depression care using customized clinical decision support PROJECT SUMMARY Treatments for mental health conditions such as unipolar depression provide modest average benefit but have wide variation between individuals and within individuals over time. Evidence-based customized treatment protocols would improve the mental health care of many people by providing treatment recommendations for individuals that take into account potential variation because of personal characteristics such as current health status, symptoms, and response to earlier treatment. Generating customized treatment protocols requires large amounts of data, such as from networks of health systems that can link electronic health records from millions of individuals. Current statistical approaches for discovering customized treatment protocols are limited in three important ways.  First, current approaches rely on scientists to select the patient characteristics to use to customize treatments instead of using data to find the patient characteristics that will lead to improved, customized care. Second, customized treatment protocols discovered with current statistical methods assume no unobserved differences between individuals who receive various treatment options. Third, investigators do not have ways to know if the available data contain enough information to discover and compare customized treatment protocols precisely enough to make clinical decisions. We will address these three limitations by developing new statistical tools for discovering customized treatment protocols using electronic health records data. Our research team has expertise and experience in statistics, epidemiology, and mental health care. We will integrate methods that have been successfully used in other settings to improve statistical approaches for discovering customized treatment protocols and address these three important limitations.  We will extend machine learning tools for selecting important pieces of information to the time-varying data structure required for discovering customized treatment protocols. We will build approaches that use available knowledge about the size of unobserved differences between groups of people who received different treatments to assess how those differences change study results. By building on the math used to estimate the sample sizes needed for precision in randomized trials with complex designs, we will develop new formulas for determining how many people with a particular condition and who took a particular drug are needed in a health system to provide enough accurate information to discover customized treatment protocols.  Using data from the electronic health records of more than 15,000 patients, we will discover customized treatment protocols for depression. By improving statistical tools and addressing current limitations, our customized treatment protocols will have immediate impact for people living with unipolar depression. The statistical tools we develop will also be useful for discovering customized treatment protocols for people with a wide variety of mental health conditions. PROJECT NARRATIVE People living with mental health conditions and their health care providers often lack evidence for making choices about numerous treatment options and they do not have evidence-based, customized treatment plans. This project will develop customized treatment plans for unipolar depression and methods to generate these plans using data from electronic health care records. This work will address current limitations in statistical methods for selecting patient characteristics for customizing treatment, assessing bias from differences between people who take different medications, and calculating how many people are needed to accurately compare customized treatment plans using data from electronic health records.",Improved tailoring of depression care using customized clinical decision support,9731644,R01MH114873,"['Antidepressive Agents ', ' anti-depressive agents ', ' anti-depressants ', ' anti-depressant drugs ', ' anti-depressant agent ', ' Antidepressants ', ' Antidepressant Drugs ', ' Antidepressant Agent ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Communities ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Goals ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Math ', ' Mathematics ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' Patients ', ' Psychotherapy ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' statistics ', ' Time ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Unipolar Depression ', ' Work ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' therapy selection ', ' Selection for Treatments ', ' Treatment Effectiveness ', ' Caring ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Sample Size ', ' Funding ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' treatment planning ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' response ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Sequential Treatment ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' electronic data ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' 13 year old ', ' thirteen years of age ', ' thirteen year old ', ' age 13 years ', ' 13 years of age ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' data structure ', ' evidence base ', ' treatment strategy ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' individualized medicine ', ' unique treatment ', ' tailored treatment ', ' tailored therapy ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' individualized treatment ', ' individualized therapy ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' customized treatment ', ' customized therapy ', ' individual patient ', ' data resource ', ' care providers ', ' primary care provider ', ' practice setting ', ' clinical decision support ', ' clinical implementation ', ' ']",NIMH,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2019,374957,CA-13,0.08704736640176777

"The neural bases of placebo effects and their relation to regulatory processes Placebo treatments can induce clinically significant benefits, compared with no-treatment controls, across a variety of disorders. But placebo treatments themselves are pharmacologically and physically inert: Their benefits result from active brain and psychological responses to the treatment context. Neuroscientific studies have established that placebo treatments influence cortical-subcortical brain pathways and neurochemical systems relevant for expectation, appraisals of personal and social meaning, and value-driven learning. These systems are also related to symptom progression across mental health disorders and several other neurological and substance use disorders. Understanding the brain and psychological mechanisms of placebo effects will help improve psychological and neurological (e.g., neuromodulation-based) treatments across disorders. This R01 renewal funds an ongoing program of research that has made fundamental contributions to this literature. It has also identified several significant gaps that are particularly important for connecting placebo research to mental health. One gap is that our understanding of the brain mechanisms underlying placebo effects comes almost purely from studies of pain. The proposed studies extend previous work to study the brain pathways underlying placebo effects in anxiety and social rejection, negative affective processes directly relevant for multiple mental health disorders. Pattern-recognition (machine learning) analyses identify the most symptom-relevant pathways, and test effects of placebo and other context interventions on these pathways. In Aim 1 (Experiments 1-3), we develop models across multiple affective symptoms, parsing affective pathways into those that are symptom-specific and those that generalize across multiple symptoms and outcomes. We also address the role of endogenous opioids, strongly linked to placebo analgesia, in other negative affective experiences. Another gap is that most previous studies of the context variables that drive strong placebo effects—including social influences, treatment history—have not been studied extensively at the brain level. In Aim 2, we study the brain pathways underlying several promising context interventions that enhance the strength of placebo effects, including social modeling of successful or unsuccessful treatment response, initial experiences of treatment success or failure, and the match between placebo suggestions and a person’s predisposition to be receptive to them.

"The neural bases of placebo effects and their relation to regulatory processes Placebo treatments can induce clinically significant benefits, compared with no-treatment controls, across a variety of disorders. But placebo treatments themselves are pharmacologically and physically inert: Their benefits result from active brain and psychological responses to the treatment context. Neuroscientific studies have established that placebo treatments influence cortical-subcortical brain pathways and neurochemical systems relevant for expectation, appraisals of personal and social meaning, and value-driven learning. These systems are also related to symptom progression across mental health disorders and several other neurological and substance use disorders. Understanding the brain and psychological mechanisms of placebo effects will help improve psychological and neurological (e.g., neuromodulation-based) treatments across disorders. This R01 renewal funds an ongoing program of research that has made fundamental contributions to this literature. It has also identified several significant gaps that are particularly important for connecting placebo research to mental health. One gap is that our understanding of the brain mechanisms underlying placebo effects comes almost purely from studies of pain. The proposed studies extend previous work to study the brain pathways underlying placebo effects in anxiety and social rejection, negative affective processes directly relevant for multiple mental health disorders. Pattern-recognition (machine learning) analyses identify the most symptom-relevant pathways, and test effects of placebo and other context interventions on these pathways. In Aim 1 (Experiments 1-3), we develop models across multiple affective symptoms, parsing affective pathways into those that are symptom-specific and those that generalize across multiple symptoms and outcomes. We also address the role of endogenous opioids, strongly linked to placebo analgesia, in other negative affective experiences. Another gap is that most previous studies of the context variables that drive strong placebo effects—including social influences, treatment history—have not been studied extensively at the brain level. In Aim 2, we study the brain pathways underlying several promising context interventions that enhance the strength of placebo effects, including social modeling of successful or unsuccessful treatment response, initial experiences of treatment success or failure, and the match between placebo suggestions and a person’s predisposition to be receptive to them.

"Estimating Population Effects in Mental Health Research Using Meta-Analysis Dr. Hwanhee Hong is a post-doctoral fellow in the Department of Mental Health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Dr. Hong obtained statistical background for biomedical research from the University of Minnesota and Harvard School of Public Health, where she completed a PhD and a MS in biostatistics, respectively. This K99 training award will help her obtain critical knowledge in mental health research and focused statistical methods to accomplish the proposed project. The proposed project aims to (1) develop statistical methods for estimating population treatment effects in the context of mental health, integrating meta-analytic techniques with a number of existing survey data analysis methods and generalizability methods for a single randomized trial, (2) validate and assess performance of the proposed methods, and apply them to real investigative randomized trials for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and (3) extend the proposed methods to network meta-analysis, comparing multiple treatments at once, for finding the best treatment for the general population. This project will enhance the use of clinical trials and meta-analyses in mental health, yielding methods to make better decisions about intervention implementation in general populations, which fits the National Institute of Mental Health’s mission. The two-year mentored training program consists of organized mentorship with regular in-person individual meetings, team meetings, formal coursework in both mental health and biostatistics, seminars, working groups, academic conferences, and career development activities. These training activities will provide the groundwork for the following three-year independent stage. Short-term career goals include to establish a better understanding of mental health research, particularly complex features of mental disorders and outcomes from relevant clinical trials, advanced topics in causal inference, and additional statistical methods for generalizing results of meta-analyses including survey weighting and flexible machine learning methods. Long-term career goals include to build an independent research portfolio and become a leading methodologist in mental health and other multidisciplinary research. The Department of Mental Health of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health provides an ideal setting for training a new independent methodologist in mental health with an extensive program of formal and informal education for post-doctoral researchers, opportunities for collaboration with researchers having expertise in diverse areas, and resources for career development. Dr. Hong will also use all available resources from other Departments including biostatistics, epidemiology, and psychiatry. This environment maximizes the potential for Dr. Hong to obtain the necessary training and perform the research to establish herself as a skilled investigator with an independent research program. This project will help mental health researchers generalize, apply, and implement findings from meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials to target populations. Traditional meta-analyses enable us to borrow strength across multiple studies to gain more power, resulting in reliable and precise effect estimates; however they do not consider how well the trials represent target populations of interest. By developing methods to help generalize the results of meta-analyses, we will help translate results into appropriate decisions regarding broad implementation and clinical practice.",Estimating Population Effects in Mental Health Research Using Meta-Analysis,9769134,R00MH111807,"['Award ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Sources ', ' Decision Making ', ' Environment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Minnesota ', ' Mission ', ' Persons ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' sham therapy ', ' Sham Treatment ', ' Placebos ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Safety ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Target Populations ', ' training module ', ' Training Activity ', ' Training Programs ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Bayesian Analysis ', ' Bayesian statistics ', ' Bayesian statistical inference ', ' Bayesian statistical analysis ', ' Bayesian spatial analysis ', ' Bayesian network analysis ', ' Bayesian inference ', ' Bayesian computation ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Collaborations ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' Performance ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' career development ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' Data ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' trial treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' Characteristics ', ' working group ', ' work group ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' treatment effect ', ' evidence base ', ' standard of care ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' clinical practice ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' RDoC ', ' Bayesian Modeling ', ' Bayesian tracking algorithms ', ' Bayesian statistical models ', ' Bayesian spatial models ', ' Bayesian spatial image models ', ' Bayesian spatial data model ', ' Bayesian nonparametric models ', ' Bayesian network model ', ' Bayesian hierarchical model ', ' Bayesian framework ', ' Bayesian belief updating model ', ' Bayesian belief network ', ' Bayesian adaptive models ', ' Bayesian adaptive designs ', ' Positive Valence ', ' Negative Valence ', ' personalized intervention ', ' precision interventions ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' informal learning ', ' informal instruction ', ' informal education ', ' open data ', ' open-source data ', ' open science ', ' data access ', ' regression trees ', ' ']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R00,2019,248999,NC-04,0.2593580618205454

"Disentangling the Epidemiologic and Genetic Heterogeneity of Postpartum Depression to Predict Risk and Prognosis PROJECT SUMMARY Postpartum depression (PPD), a common complication of childbirth, has significant morbidity and mortality for mother and child, yet etiology is still poorly understood. PPD is a more heritable subtype of MDD, yet significant heterogeneity exists within the PPD phenotype, which may reflect differences in etiology. This study aims to disentangle the heterogeneity of PPD to understand etiology by leveraging existing data from two unique global resources, the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) and the US arm of the Postpartum Depression: Action Towards Causes and Treatment Consortium. The study aims to 1) apply modern statistical learning methods in a master training set (N=63,528) and two independent testing sets (N=31,716 and N=4,978) to identify PPD subtypes, 2) identify genetic contributors to PPD subtypes and genetic overlap with other traits, and 3) examine the extent to which PPD subtypes predict longer-term mental health prognosis. This research will support my primary career goal to become an independently funded investigator with the expertise necessary to conduct integrated epidemiologic and genomic research to understand the complex etiology of PPD. My long-term research objective is to develop comprehensive risk prediction models that can ultimately be translated into effective preventive interventions and novel individualized treatments for PPD. I have expertise is in epidemiology and perinatal health, but I need additional mentored training to conduct large- scale, integrated gene-environment analyses to understand the biological basis of PPD. The specific objectives to meet my career goal are to 1) develop skills in data science to effectively analyze large, complex datasets, 2) establish an in-depth understanding of genomics and statistical genetics, and 3) understand the complex phenotypes of PPD and other related psychiatric conditions. The core mentorship team consists of Dr. Samantha Meltzer-Brody, lead mentor, an internationally recognized expert in perinatal mental health research, and Dr. Patrick Sullivan, co-lead mentor, a psychiatric geneticist who has built a collaborative network of depression research in Scandinavia. Dr. Yun Li, co-mentor, has extensive experience in developing statistical and computational methods for genomic and high-dimensional data. Dr. Ted Reichborn-Kjennerud, co-mentor, and Drs. Helga Ask and Alexandra Havdahl, collaborators, have extensive experience with assessment of psychiatric outcomes in the MoBa cohort. Dr. Cathryn Lewis, collaborator, is a leading expert in the development of genetic risk score methodology. Their combined mentorship will place me in an ideal position to succeed as an independent investigator. This work will inform further investigation of unique contributions of genes and environment to develop multifactorial predictive models for PPD, representing an important step towards personalized medicine in perinatal mental health. The vital skills I attain during this grant award will provide a foundation for future research evaluating interventions for prevention and personalized therapeutic treatments of PPD. PROJECT NARRATIVE PPD is a common complication of childbirth with substantial morbidity, mortality, and personal and societal costs. Identifying subtypes of PPD (Aim 1), their genetic overlap with other psychiatric disorders and traits (Aim 2), and examining how they predict longer-term mental health prognosis (Aim 3) will make a significant contribution to understanding the biological underpinnings of PPD and determining potential points of intervention. Disentangling the heterogeneity of PPD and developing sophisticated risk prediction models that integrate genetic and epidemiologic risk factors could ultimately assist in early detection, differential diagnosis, and development of personalized intervention and treatment options for these devastating disorders.",Disentangling the Epidemiologic and Genetic Heterogeneity of Postpartum Depression to Predict Risk and Prognosis,9805582,K01MH120352,"['Affect ', ' Anxiety ', ' Award ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Complication ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Differential Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Therapeutic Estrogen ', ' Estrogens ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Literature ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methodology ', ' Modernization ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"ANALYSIS OF NONSTATIONARY NEURAL DATA ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Much mental health research uses neurophysiological measurements to describe the way neural activity within and across brain regions is related to behavioral function and dysfunction. One kind of signal, known as spike trains, comes from individual neurons. Other signals, including local field potentials (LFPs), electroencephalography (EEGs), and magnetoencephalography (MEG) are based on activity from large numbers of neurons within specified parts of the brain. With all of these sources of data, scientifically rigorous statistical analysis must accommodate unstable fluctuations, associated with movement or thought, known in statistics as non-stationary. The continuing research program of this grant is to develop methods for analyzing non-stationary neural data. The number of neural signals that can be recorded simultaneously has been increasing rapidly. Because neural network dysfunction is widely considered to be associated with psychopathology, improvements in recording technologies offer exciting opportunities. They also create big statistical challenges due to greatly increased complexity. The research in this grant aims to provide methods for analyzing the ways that network structure may change with particular variables, including those that help characterize behavior, which involves the transmission of neural information at multiple timescales. Fast timescales include oscillations and neural synchrony, which could provide an essential mechanism of neural network information flow and may be a marker that distinguishes normal from diseased states. At slower timescales there is considerable redundancy in the recorded signals, which suggests dimensionality reduction. New methods investigated in this research program can accommodate both faster and slower timescales, and they can also accommodate relationships arising from the spatial configuration of electrodes that record neural signals. These methods are tailored to handle spike trains, LFP, and MEG data, especially as they might arise in experiments related to mental health research. Because a neural spike train is a set of times at which a neuron fired, it is common to consider it to be a point process, which is the statistical model set up to handle sequences of event times. The research supported by this grant concerns development and investigation of statistical techniques involving both multi-dimensional continuous time series (for LFP, EEG, and MEG data) and multi-dimensional point processes (for spike trains). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Much mental health research relies on measurements of brain activity across different parts of the brain, and often poses difficult problems in statisticl analysis. The research supported by this grant develops new methods of analyzing brain signals as they evolve across time. Of special interest is the way networks of interacting brain components may change under varying conditions.",ANALYSIS OF NONSTATIONARY NEURAL DATA,9669985,R01MH064537,"['Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Electrodes ', ' EEG ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' Exhibits ', ' Grant ', ' Information Networks ', ' Learning ', ' Least-Squares Analyses ', ' Least Squares ', ' Least-Squares Analysis ', ' magnetoencephalographic imaging ', ' MEG imaging ', ' Magnetoencephalography ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Structural Models ', ' body movement ', ' Movement ', ' Neural Transmission ', ' Synaptic Transmission ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' neurophysiological ', ' neurophysiology ', ' living system ', ' Organism ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' Research ', ' Research Support ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' statistics ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Functional disorder ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Collaborations ', ' Letters ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Dimensions ', ' Frequencies ', ' Dependence ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' parallel processing ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Structure ', ' neurotransmission ', ' neuronal signaling ', ' neural signaling ', ' nerve signaling ', ' glial signaling ', ' glia signaling ', ' axonal signaling ', ' axon-glial signaling ', ' axon signaling ', ' Neuronal Transmission ', ' Nerve Transmission ', ' Nerve Impulse Transmission ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' Time Series Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Brain region ', ' Data ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' network dysfunction ', ' scale up ', ' frontier ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' Implant ', ' network models ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' public health relevance ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' Gaussian model ', ' Gaussianity model ', ' Gaussianity ', ' Gaussian statistics ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' high dimensionality ', ' source localization ', ' neural network ', ' ']",NIMH,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,378758,PA-18,0.11804869207624347
"Socioemotional Processing and Aggression Project Summary/Abstract Complex relationships exist between mental illness and aggression, particularly interpersonal aggression that can lead to antisocial behavior. Unfortunately, conducting high-impact mental health research among those who have committed serious aggressive acts against persons has been strategically challenging for many reasons. This research plan employs unique resources that enable advanced cognitive neuroscience research to be conducted in forensic environments. Here we leverage these resources to examine impaired functioning of neural circuits that contribute to specific varieties of serious aggressive behavior. Callous and unemotional traits, impulsive/disinhibited behavior, and appetitive desire to harm others, all have identifiable roots in neurocognitive function. We will examine how clinical levels of these latter traits are related to abnormalities in the neural circuits involved in affective perspective taking, moral decision-making, and behavioral inhibition. Normative neural responses for each of these processes have been well-characterized by our prior work. We seek to differentiate between unique pathophysiological etiologies that contribute to specific behavioral tendencies. We further aim to elucidate the modifying influence of early childhood trauma in these neurocognitive domains. Understanding these differences will promote more sophisticated prevention and intervention strategies that incorporate specific knowledge of neurocognitive vulnerabilities and remedial approaches for improving long-range outcomes for individuals and for the public. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Aggressive behavior is a major public health concern that intersects with challenging venues of mental health research. This research plan implements unique resources to carry out cognitive neuroscience research among highly aggressive inmates with mental illnesses to differentiate among several etiological trajectories promoting these behaviors.

"Statistical Methods for Analyzing Complex, Multi-dimensional Data from Cross-sectional and Longitudinal Mental Health Studies Project Summary  To address the burden of mental illness, National institute of Mental Health encourages development of computational approaches that provide novel ways to understand relationships among complex, large datasets to further the understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of mental diseases. These datasets are multi- dimensional, including clinical assessments, behavioral symptoms, biological measurements such as neu- roimaging and psychophysiological data. The overall objective of this grant is to advance methodology for analyzing such data to more effectively extract relevant information that are predictive of disease, to improve the understanding of individual variability in clinical and neurobiological phenotypes, and to provide the capac- ity to handle both cross-sectional and longitudinal data.  Our proposal will leverage two civilian trauma cohorts recruited through the Grady Trauma Project and the Grady Emergency Department Study, and an external validation cohort from the Hill Center study with a similar distribution of trauma exposure. We propose to develop statistically principled, computationally efﬁ- cient statistical learning methods for addressing key challenges in analyzing these large datasets. Challenges include multi-type outcomes, high dimensional data with sparse signals and high noise levels, spatial and tem- poral dependence of neuroimaging data, and heterogeneous effects across patient population. The scientiﬁc premise of this computational psychiatry research is that analytical methods integrating information from brain, behavior, and symptoms will provide much-needed data driven platforms for improving diagnosis and prediction of PTSD and other mental disorders.  In this application, we propose: (1) to develop partial generalized tensor regression methods and partial tensor quantile regression methods that can simultaneously achieve accurate prediction of clinical outcomes and efﬁcient feature extraction from high dimensional neuroimaging biomarkers; (2) to develop tensor response quantile regression methods and global inference that can achieve comprehensive and robust understanding of the heterogeneity in high-dimensional neuroimaging phenotypes in terms of environmental factors such as trauma exposure; and (3) to develop and extend methods in Aims 1 and 2 for longitudinal multi-dimensional data that will enable prediction of future post-trauma symptom severity trajectories in terms of neuroimaging biomarkers and robustify the evaluation of the impact of psychophysiological factors on neuroimaging phe- notypes. The proposed methods will be applied to the two Grady studies to address scientiﬁc hypotheses relevant to PTSD research. We will use the Hill Center study as an independent validation cohort to evaluate the reproducibility and generalizability of the ﬁndings. User-friendly software will be developed. The proposed methodology is generally applicable to many other mental health studies with complex multi-dimensional data. Narrative We propose to develop statistical methods for analyzing large-scale and multi-dimensional data in mental health studies to more effectively extract relevant information that are predictive of disease and to help understand individual variability in clinical and neurobiological phenotypes. The applications of the proposed methods will generate new knowledge to further the understanding of the mechanism and progression of the PTSD that will lead to improved disease management strategies.","Statistical Methods for Analyzing Complex, Multi-dimensional Data from Cross-sectional and Longitudinal Mental Health Studies",9839143,R01MH118771,"['Amygdaloid structure ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdala ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Behavioral Symptoms ', ' juvenile sex abuse ', ' childhood sexual abuse ', ' Child Sexual Molestation ', ' Child Sexual Abuse ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' Future ', ' Grant ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Maps ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurobiology ', ' Noise ', ' Phenotype ', ' Psychiatry ', ' psycho-physiological ', ' physiopsychology ', ' Psychophysiological ', ' Physiological Psychology ', ' Physiologic Psychology ', ' Psychophysiology ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' PTSD ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' United States ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Functional disorder ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Disease Management ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Dimensions ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Pattern ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' user friendly software ', ' user friendly computer software ', ' cohort ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Structure ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' novel ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' neural circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Validation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' vector ', ' burden of illness ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Outcome ', ' Impact evaluation ', ' Trauma ', ' brain behavior ', ' neurobiological mechanism ', ' high risk ', ' patient population ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' clinical predictors ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' trauma symptom ', ' predict clinical outcome ', ' predictor of clinical outcome ', ' clinical outcome prediction ', ' neuroimaging marker ', ' neuroimaging biomarker ', ' high dimensionality ', ' recruit ', ' individual variation ', ' individual variability ', ' individual heterogeneity ', ' trauma exposure ', ' exposure to trauma ', ' multidimensional data ', ' high dimensional data ', ' ']",NIMH,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,614061,GA-05,0.1385306788098467

"Integrating neuroimaging and brain gene expression for functional characterization of psychiatric GWAS PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Mental disorders are complex, debilitating health conditions, yet the neurobiological causes and pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these disorders are not well understood. The emergence of large- scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has enabled identification of significant, reliable genetic associations to mental disorders. However, it has been difficult to translate GWAS loci into specific causal driver variants/genes to extract mechanistic insights for identifying actionable targets for therapeutic interventions. Neurobiological intermediate phenotypes (NBIPs) are invaluable in understanding the brain’s structural and functional correlates of elevated risk of psychopathology, although the underlying processes and molecular mechanisms for observed NBIPs are elusive. Recent advances in genetic-based imputation now allow one to infer genetically-regulated portions of intermediate phenotypes from genome-wide genotype data. Our research team has successfully employed brain-specific transcriptomic imputation approaches across mental disorders to identify novel genes and pathways of risk. In this proposal, we seek to increase the biological resolution of the link between neuroimaging genetics and psychiatric genetics by creating novel polygenic models of multimodal neuroimaging based on brain-specific gene expression that can be applied to psychiatric GWAS. In Aim 1, we will generate brain transcriptomic predictive models of multimodal neuroimaging and replicate them in independent datasets. In Aim 2, we will conduct Imaging Transcriptome-wide Association Studies (ITWAS) to identify neuroimaging associations with mental disorders at a brain-specific gene-level and distinguish the causal ones. Our integrative analyses will enhance our understanding of NBIPs and mental disorder risk; thus, they will provide mechanistic insights that may drive identification of novel diagnostic, trans-diagnostic and treatment approaches. PROJECT NARRATIVE Mental disorders have substantial morbidity and mortality, contributing to devastating emotional, social and financial tolls on sufferers and their families.

"MISSION U: A MULTIMEDIA TRAINING TOOL FOR TREATING INDIVIDUALS WITH CO-OCCURRING MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS Co-occurring mental health and substance use disorders (COD) are common in the United States and providers have been challenged to provide effective treatments. As a consequence, their clients with COD may experience poor treatment engagement, symptom exacerbation and cycle in and out of emergency services. This is particularly true for underrepresented populations with a COD including individuals whom are homeless and involved in the criminally justice system. Research shows that integrated and coordinated community- based services for COD can improve client outcomes. However, healthcare workforce has a gap in training staff on such treatment techniques, which we aim to close via this Phase II STTR project.  Maintaining Independence and Sobriety through Systems Integration, Outreach and Networking (MISSION) is a unique evidence-based, trans-disciplinary treatment designed to address the complex needs of individuals with CODs and includes manuals for high risk populations of civilian and veteran homeless individuals as well as those involved in the criminally justice system. Listed in the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration-Registry for Evidence Based Practices (NREPP), MISSION has had substantial impact. The Veterans Health Administration has deployed it in their national plan to end Veteran Homelessness. Massachusetts has used it in its Statewide Plan to End Homelessness and written it into Public Law for delivery alongside Veterans Treatment courts. While MISSION is a manualized treatment, a recent multisite implementation study identified the need for more comprehensive training tools. With NIAAA support, the University of Massachusetts Medical School (MISSION developers) partnered with Praxis on a Phase I STTR to (1) develop the MISSION University online training platform, (2) show proof of concept by implementing two training modules and an e-simulation case study, and (3) conduct a pilot randomized trial which demonstrated that training-as-usual Distance Learning (DL) + Technical Assistance (TA) outperformed TA alone.  In Phase II, we will complete MISSION U by developing and testing five new MISSION modules and companion e-simulations tools that test knowledge acquisition and application. We will first do a formative evaluation with 20 learners who will provide feedback on MISSION U modules. This will be followed by a randomized controlled trial similar to Phase I in which 60 learners will be randomized to the DL or the DL+TA conditions. In preparation for future scalability, we will uniquely conduct a qualitative process evaluation using the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance framework with 42 MISSION U participants to look at facilitators and barriers to implementation. Lastly, we will pilot test machine learning techniques with our 60 individuals who participated in the randomized trial in an effort to help personalize the MISSION U training experience for commercialization. !1 “MISSION U: A Multimedia Training Tool for Treatment of Individuals with Co-occurring Mental Health and Substance Use Disorders” is aimed at training providers of services for these individuals. MISSION U challenges prevailing provider training methodology that relies mainly on on-site provider training and/or online training using typical classroom-type materials. This project not only addresses the growing need for new provider training methodologies, but also offers the promise of improving clinical efficacy and reducing training costs and medical expenditures overall.! !",MISSION U: A MULTIMEDIA TRAINING TOOL FOR TREATING INDIVIDUALS WITH CO-OCCURRING MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS,9942350,R42AA026751,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Assertiveness ', ' Client ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Curriculum ', ' lesson plans ', ' Knowledge acquisition ', ' Emergency medical service ', ' emergency service ', ' England ', ' Expenditure ', ' Feedback ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Laws ', ' Maintenance ', ' Manuals ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Materials Testing ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methodology ', ' National Health Services ', ' Play ', ' Pre-Post Tests ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' medical schools ', ' medical college ', ' school of medicine ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Testing ', ' Training Activity ', ' training module ', ' Training Programs ', ' United States ', ' United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration ', ' SAMHSA ', ' Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration ', ' United States Department of Veterans Affairs ', ' United States Veterans Administration ', ' Veterans Administration ', ' Universities ', ' Veterans ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Administrator ', ' case report ', ' Case Study ', ' Criminal Justice ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Specialist ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' court ', ' health administration ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' incarcerated ', ' incarceration ', ' Imprisonment ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' homeless ', ' unhoused ', ' Homelessness ', ' Individual ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service use ', ' healthcare service use ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' satisfaction ', ' Systems Integration ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Companions ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Multimedium ', ' Multimedia ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Services ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' experience ', ' field based data ', ' field learning ', ' field test ', ' field study ', ' computer science ', ' Distance Learning ', ' skills ', ' simulation ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' sober ', ' sobriety ', ' outreach ', ' Care Manager ', ' Case Management Nurse ', ' Case Manager ', ' behavioral health ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Videoconferences ', ' Symptoms ', ' Evidence based practice ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' STTR ', ' Small Business Technology Transfer Research ', ' Preparation ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' Instruction ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' clinical efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' NIAAA ', ' National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism ', ' community based service ', ' Evidence based program ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' usability ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy design ', ' prototype ', ' commercialization ', ' Psychosocial Issues ', ' Psychosocial Influences ', ' evidence base ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' Randomization trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' arm ', ' operation ', ' Education Module ', ' Educational Module ', ' Teaching Module ', ' Learning Module ', ' phase 1 trial ', ' phase I trial ', ' peer support ', ' formative evaluation ', ' formative assessment ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' high risk group ', ' high risk population ', ' provider networks ', ' service providers ', ' ']",NIAAA,"PRAXIS, INC.",R42,2020,738169,MA-05,0.05942682809291661
"Leveraging interactive SMS messaging to monitor and support maternal mental health in Kenya ABSTRACT Perinatal depression, defined as a depressive episode during pregnancy or in the first year postpartum, is the most common complication of childbirth, affecting up to 20% of peripartum women globally. An enormous gap exists in supporting women experiencing perinatal depression. Mobile health (mHealth) interventions such as interactive SMS text messaging with healthcare workers (HCWs) have been proposed as resource-efficient, accessible adjuncts to in-person care. Realizing the full public health potential of mHealth for mental health will require strategic use of automation and empiric definition of interventions that dynamically adapt to user needs. This K18 mentored career enhancement award aims to support Dr. Keshet Ronen, an epidemiologist with multidisciplinary training, to become an expert in analysis of mHealth communication and development of adaptive mHealth interventions. Building on Dr. Ronen’s established expertise in development and evaluation of mHealth interventions using SMS and social media, and supported by a team of experienced mentors, the following research and training aims are proposed. Training plan: Through didactic coursework, individual mentor meetings, seminars, and conferences, Dr. Ronen seeks to accomplish the following Career Enhancement Goals. (1) Gain proficiency and experience using natural language processing and machine learning methods to analyze mHealth communication. (2) Gain proficiency and experience in design of an adaptive mHealth intervention. (3) Deepen understanding of mHealth intervention design for mental health. (4) Enhance skills in international study implementation and clinical trial design. The proposed training plan will augment Dr. Ronen’s prior training and experience and allow her to complete the proposed Research plan: Mobile WACh is a unique interactive SMS messaging platform that has been shown to improve maternal-child health and whose impact on perinatal depression is currently being evaluated in a randomized controlled trial in Kenya, Mobile WACh Neo. We propose to leverage a dataset of >100,000 SMS messages with >3000 peripartum women in previous and ongoing Mobile WACh studies to (1) develop a predictive model that can detect client SMS indicating elevated depression symptoms, and (2) identify HCW message characteristics associated with improvements in depression symptoms. (3) Models from Aims 1-2 will be implemented in the Mobile WACh software to develop an adaptive version of Mobile WACh Neo that flags concerning messages and guides HCWs on SMS composition. A pilot study of Adaptive Mobile WACh Neo will be conducted, nested within the Mobile WACh Neo randomized controlled trial in Kenya (R01HD098105), to evaluate its acceptability and preliminary impact on time taken for HCWs to respond to client messages. Collectively, these activities will enable Dr. Ronen to become a leader in the study of adaptive mHealth interventions to support maternal mental health in resource-limited settings. PROJECT NARRATIVE Depression is the most common complication of pregnancy, but it is undertreated due to lack of mental healthcare resources and barriers to in-person care. Short message service (SMS) text messaging is a promising tool to support mental health in the high-risk peripartum period.

"Bioinformatics for post-traumatic stress Project Summary/Abstract Maladaptive complications following trauma, including post-traumatic stress (PTS), are highly prevalent in both veterans and civilians, and have been difficult to accurately diagnose, manage and treat. Debate regarding diagnostic criteria and the need to represent the full spectrum of inter-connected features contributing to psychopathology has spawned the development of the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). RDoC is a developing framework to help guide the discovery and validation of new dimensions of mental health disorders and their relationships to underlying biological mechanisms. NIMH now has a rich federated database that currently houses raw data from RDoC-sponsored clinical research, and clinical trial data from the National Database of Clinical Trials (NDCT) with information that may help to unlock the complex and overlapping relationships between symptoms of PTS and the underlying biomarkers to fuel improvements on diagnostic and therapeutic frameworks for trauma recovery. The proposed project will apply bioinformatics and machine learning analytical tools to these large, heterogeneous datasets to identify and validate new research dimensions of trauma-related psychopathology and treatment response trajectories and their predictors. Aim 1 will develop an in silico trauma patient population by integrating data from diverse sources, including cross-sectional and observational longitudinal clinical studies housed within available data repositories for trauma and other related mental health research. Data will include medical history, demographics, diagnostic tests, clinical outcomes, psychological assessments, genomics, imaging, and other relevant study and meta-data. Aim 2 will identify multiple dimensions of PTS diagnostic criteria, using a combination of unsupervised dimension-reduction statistical methods, internal and external cross-validation, and supervised hypothesis testing of predictive models to understand the heterogeneous subtypes of PTS. Aim 3 will deploy unsupervised machine learning methods, such as topological data analysis and hierarchical clustering, to identify unique clusters of patients based on symptomatology to develop clustering methods for precision mapping of PTS patients based on disease severity. Aim 4 will use supervised machine learning techniques for targeted predictive analytics focused on identifying treatment responders from the NDCT, and identification of latent variables that predict treatment response. The results of the proposed research project will greatly enrich the field of computational psychiatry research to identify conserved dimensions associated with the complex relationships of psychopathology and precision treatment planning following exposure to traumatic events. Project Narrative A recent restructuring of diagnostic and research criteria for psychiatric disorders has been implemented to promote greater understanding of the biological mechanisms involved in the development of complex mental health disorders. The proposed project aims to apply bioinformatics and machine learning analytics to large datasets from trauma-exposed patients to identify and validate dimensions of post-traumatic stress (PTS),

"Laboratory for Early Psychosis Research (LEAP) 1. Abstract We propose to create a NIMH P50 ALACRITY Center that develops the collaborations, data systems, and methods necessary to form a state-wide Laboratory for Early Psychosis Research, aka the LEAP Center. While recent trial evidence suggests great promise for coordinated specialty care (CSC) for patients with first episode psychosis (FEP), there remain several gaps in the knowledge base for the care of psychosis in general. Now is an ideal time to address these gaps because of recent policy changes enhancing FEP care financing, practice changes in the field, and methods developed outside of mental health. To create this Center, we will start with interdisciplinary collaborations between CSC clinics in Massachusetts, policy makers/regulators, and stakeholders, and include FEP experts from across the country plus scientific experts from outside of mental health, e.g., in data science, machine learning, epidemiology, and health policy. We also will leverage recent Massachusetts efforts to mandate, standardized, and support data collection on FEP care structures, delivery, and outcomes from all FEP clinics within the state. We also will apply and develop modern methods for clinical prediction and comparative effectiveness research (CER), e.g., machine learning and g-methods, for FEP research. Accordingly, we have three overall Center aims: 1) Collaborations; 2) Data systems; and 3) Prediction and CER methods. The Center will start with three foundational and complementary projects: 1) Using the state All Payer Claims Database (APCD), Project 1 will apply a population-level approach to examine which patients receive care in FEP clinics offering CSC versus elsewhere, as the number of clinics increases, then estimate the treatment effect on unfavorable clinical event rates such as hospitalizations; 2) Project 2 will review the data collected by the state from all of the FEP clinics, assess and improve data collection quality, validate measures, and integrate perspectives; and 3) Project 3 will define clusters of patients using longitudinal outcome data (i.e., begin to unpack the amount of clinical heterogeneity), predict the cluster type for individual patients, and examine the impact of CSC treatment accounting for this clinical heterogeneity. The Administrative Core and Methods Core (Prediction and CER) bind these projects together. The Center will include a group of Scientific Advisors from across North America, Center Faculty from diverse scientific disciplines, including those that historically have had little exposure in mental health research, and Stakeholders, including policy makers, organizational decision makers, and patient and family advocates. All three groups will be deeply involved in the Center from design to dissemination. The overall goal is to create a state-wide learning health system for early psychosis. This effort to create the protocols and apply the methods necessary to convert large amounts of data into useful clinical and policy knowledge will inform other national efforts, e.g., NIMH’s EPINET. Project Narrative Psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia are common illnesses with serious, negative effects on patients and families; fortunately, recent studies suggest that early coordinated treatment might help mitigate some of these adverse effects. There remain many questions, however, about the disease course and treatment options, including what treatments will work best for which patients. This Center will be dedicated to addressing these questions by bringing together leading clinicians and scientists, and creating the systems needed to conduct studies to provide guidance to patients, families, and clinicians in the future.",Laboratory for Early Psychosis Research (LEAP),9928111,P50MH115846,"['Accounting ', ' Attention ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Data Collection ', ' health care delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health services delivery ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Economics ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Faculty ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health Policy ', ' health care policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Information Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' Insurance ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' North America ', ' Operations Research ', ' Patient Outcomes Assessments ', ' Patient Reported Measures ', ' Patient Reported Outcomes ', ' Patients ', ' Psychotic Disorders ', ' Psychoses ', ' psychotic illness ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Schizoaffective Disorders ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Science ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Standardization ', ' statistics ', ' Students ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Administrator ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' symposium ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Discipline ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Policies ', ' data quality ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Funding ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' transdisciplinary collaboration ', ' interdisciplinary collaboration ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' Structure ', ' Adverse effects ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' Subgroup ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Process ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' first episode psychosis ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' treatment effect ', ' faculty community ', ' Data Science ', ' individual patient ', ' health care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' care outcomes ', ' clinical heterogeneity ', ' Comparative Effectiveness Research ', ' harmonized data ', ' data harmonization ', ' ']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,P50,2020,1704908,MA-05,0.09869859499143474
"Improved tailoring of depression care using customized clinical decision support PROJECT SUMMARY Treatments for mental health conditions such as unipolar depression provide modest average benefit but have wide variation between individuals and within individuals over time. Evidence-based customized treatment protocols would improve the mental health care of many people by providing treatment recommendations for individuals that take into account potential variation because of personal characteristics such as current health status, symptoms, and response to earlier treatment. Generating customized treatment protocols requires large amounts of data, such as from networks of health systems that can link electronic health records from millions of individuals. Current statistical approaches for discovering customized treatment protocols are limited in three important ways.  First, current approaches rely on scientists to select the patient characteristics to use to customize treatments instead of using data to find the patient characteristics that will lead to improved, customized care. Second, customized treatment protocols discovered with current statistical methods assume no unobserved differences between individuals who receive various treatment options. Third, investigators do not have ways to know if the available data contain enough information to discover and compare customized treatment protocols precisely enough to make clinical decisions. We will address these three limitations by developing new statistical tools for discovering customized treatment protocols using electronic health records data. Our research team has expertise and experience in statistics, epidemiology, and mental health care. We will integrate methods that have been successfully used in other settings to improve statistical approaches for discovering customized treatment protocols and address these three important limitations.  We will extend machine learning tools for selecting important pieces of information to the time-varying data structure required for discovering customized treatment protocols. We will build approaches that use available knowledge about the size of unobserved differences between groups of people who received different treatments to assess how those differences change study results. By building on the math used to estimate the sample sizes needed for precision in randomized trials with complex designs, we will develop new formulas for determining how many people with a particular condition and who took a particular drug are needed in a health system to provide enough accurate information to discover customized treatment protocols.  Using data from the electronic health records of more than 15,000 patients, we will discover customized treatment protocols for depression. By improving statistical tools and addressing current limitations, our customized treatment protocols will have immediate impact for people living with unipolar depression. The statistical tools we develop will also be useful for discovering customized treatment protocols for people with a wide variety of mental health conditions. PROJECT NARRATIVE People living with mental health conditions and their health care providers often lack evidence for making choices about numerous treatment options and they do not have evidence-based, customized treatment plans. This project will develop customized treatment plans for unipolar depression and methods to generate these plans using data from electronic health care records. This work will address current limitations in statistical methods for selecting patient characteristics for customizing treatment, assessing bias from differences between people who take different medications, and calculating how many people are needed to accurately compare customized treatment plans using data from electronic health records.",Improved tailoring of depression care using customized clinical decision support,9913586,R01MH114873,"['Antidepressive Agents ', ' Antidepressant Agent ', ' Antidepressant Drugs ', ' Antidepressants ', ' anti-depressant agent ', ' anti-depressant drugs ', ' anti-depressants ', ' anti-depressive agents ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' Communities ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Patients ', ' Psychotherapy ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' statistics ', ' Time ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Unipolar Depression ', ' Work ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' therapy selection ', ' Selection for Treatments ', ' Treatment Effectiveness ', ' Caring ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Sample Size ', ' Funding ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' treatment planning ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' response ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Sequential Treatment ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' electronic data ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' 13 years of age ', ' age 13 years ', ' thirteen year old ', ' thirteen years of age ', ' 13 year old ', ' early therapy ', ' Early treatment ', ' data structure ', ' evidence base ', ' treatment strategy ', ' Randomization trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' precision medicine ', ' customized therapy ', ' customized treatment ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' individualized therapy ', ' individualized treatment ', ' patient specific therapies ', ' patient specific treatment ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' tailored therapy ', ' tailored treatment ', ' unique treatment ', ' individualized medicine ', ' individual patient ', ' data resource ', ' primary care provider ', ' care providers ', ' practice setting ', ' clinical decision support ', ' clinical implementation ', ' structured data ', ' large scale data sets ', ' large scale datasets ', ' large scale data ', ' ']",NIMH,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2020,372812,CA-13,0.08704736640176777
"Sex hormones and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) Project summary The untreated burden of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the United States is a massive contributor to healthcare budgets in both the military and civilian sectors, and better treatment and prevention methods are needed. Fortunately, awareness of PTSD among military service members has grown in recent years, and yet, there is a hidden epidemic of PTSD among civilians and women. Women experience PTSD at about twice the rate of men (11% vs. 5%), but the causes for this sex difference are largely unknown. It has long been suspected that sex hormones play a major role in development of – and also potentially protection from – PTSD and other mental health disorders. This project will provide the largest ever study of sex hormone effects on PTSD and the related mental health outcomes of depression and anxiety disorders. Whereas studies in the past were limited by small sample sizes and results were inconclusive, this investigation will use a massive sample size of approximately 500,000 participants to answer questions about two well-known sex hormones (testosterone and estradiol) and three psychiatric outcomes (PTSD, depression, and anxiety disorders). These variables were measured in the UK Biobank, and we have been granted access to the data to study sex hormone effects on mental health outcomes and to study genetic effects underlying both sex hormone levels and mental health disorders. The completion of this work will reveal whether rates of mental health disorders vary with testosterone and estradiol levels. It may be the case that levels of hormones that are both too high and too low are problematic. Given this reality, we will use sophisticated regression and machine learning techniques, and therefore we will be able to detect linear and non-linear relationships between sex hormones and PTSD, depression, and anxiety disorders. The sample size and study design make this the most powerful study conducted to date, and the results will be generalizable to diverse populations. In addition to the outcomes mentioned above, we will further explore genetic effects underlying relationships between sex hormones and mental health disorders. To do this, we will conduct genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of both testosterone and estradiol. We will then make polygenic scores for testosterone and estradiol, yielding genetic proxies of sex hormone levels which can be used in studies in which sex hormones have not been measured. Finally, we will test for shared genetic effects between genetic effects on sex hormones and genetic effects on psychiatric disorders in order to better understand the etiology of these common, debilitating, and inadequately treated mental health disorders. Taken together, these findings will provide critical foundational knowledge relevant to clinical trials which are currently testing testosterone and estradiol as treatments for PTSD, depression, and anxiety disorders. These results will also provide actionable findings for the development of novel treatment and prevention strategies. Project Narrative / Public Health Relevance Sex hormone altering medications are prescribed to over 40% of American adults, and yet the mental health consequences of sex hormones are still poorly understood. This project will be the largest ever investigation of sex hormone effects on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety disorders, and the results of this powerful study design will provide much-needed information relevant to the development of new treatment and prevention strategies.

"The Development and Systematic Evaluation of an AI-Assisted Just-in-Time-Adaptive-Intervention for Improving Child Mental Health PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Early childhood mental health problems constitute a significant public health concern with wide-ranging impacts on functioning both concurrently and later in life. Although childhood mental health is influenced by a variety of factors, the quality of relationships with caregivers plays a critical role. Critical, coercive, and conflictual parent- child interactions have been consistently linked with increased risk of externalizing and internalizing symptoms, whereas supportive and nurturing relationships have been shown to confer protective effects. Early intervention of maladaptive family relationships is thus crucial for preventing or offsetting negative developmental trajectories in at-risk children. A variety of therapeutic methods have been developed and employed to foster positive parent- child relationships and improve child mental health, including parent training/education, in-person therapy, home visiting, school curriculums, and web programs. However, systematic obstacles interfere with the accessibility, generalizability, and acceptability of these traditional appointment- and module-based approaches. Furthermore, limitations in the family-centered flexibility, individual responsiveness, and broad availability of these services render them inadequate to address the unique needs of at-risk populations who would benefit from more readily accessible and inexpensive 24-hour support that is provided in real time and real life—when and where support is needed most. Not surprisingly, research finds that roughly half of the families who do participate in traditional appointment- and module-based mental health services fail to show sufficient symptom improvement. Just-in- time adaptive interventions (JITAIs), in contrast, utilize smartphones, wearables, and artificial intelligence (AI) to identify and respond to psychological and behavioral processes and contextual events as they unfold in everyday life. Although JITAIs have the potential to transform the way people receive mental health support, barriers to their successful, wide-scale implementation remain. Using pilot data collected from smartphones and wearables, our interdisciplinary team of psychologists and engineers used AI to build machine learning algorithms to detect psychological states and contextual events, such as ongoing moods and relationship conflict, in couples. In the current project, we propose developing and testing a JITAI to provide opportune supports to families in dynamic response to contextual events and shifting psychological states to amplify attachment bonds, regulate emotion, and intervene in maladaptive parent-child interactional patterns. Building on our prior research, we will (1) build software to unobtrusively capture real-time data from commercially-available mobile devices, (2) use machine learning to develop algorithms to automatically monitor psychological and behavioral processes relevant to child mental health, (3) launch a JITAI to provide as-needed intervention, and (4) carry out a micro-randomized clinical trial to test the efficacy, acceptability, and safety of our JITAI for decreasing child internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Our project will contribute to the development of technology ecosystems and service delivery models with the power to meaningfully transform the accessibility and dynamic responsiveness of mental health care. PROJECT NARRATIVE Mental health problems in childhood are highly prevalent and impairing, placing an immense social and economic burden on society. Parent-child relationships in the early years of life play a critical role in promoting child mental health, with critical and coercive relationships increasing the risk of mental health problems across the lifespan. Our project includes the creation and systematic evaluation of an innovative technology-based therapy system that employs artificial intelligence to monitor and responsively administer dynamic (i.e., as needed) supports to families in real-world settings in order to promote positive family relationships and improve child mental health.",The Development and Systematic Evaluation of an AI-Assisted

"CBTpro: Scaling up CBT for psychosis using simulated patients and spoken language technologies Psychosis resulting from schizophrenia spectrum disorders and major mood disorders is one of the most disabling health concerns worldwide. Evidence-based psychotherapeutic interventions are recommended as standard of care by national psychosis treatment guidelines but are rarely accessible. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for psychosis (CBTp) is the most well-researched psychotherapy for psychotic disorders, yet fewer than 1% of American mental health providers are trained in this intervention. To date, there has been no scalable way to offer high-quality and sustainable CBTp training to mental health providers. The primary objective of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) proposal is to develop and evaluate a spoken language technology tool – CBTpro -- to support high-quality skills training in CBTp. CBTpro will provide a rapid means of scaling and sustaining CBTp in routine care settings across the US, resulting in more clinicians across the country providing higher quality CBTp to individuals with psychosis. This fast-track STTR proposal has two phases. The objective of Phase I is to develop a CBTpro prototype, which requires three core activities: Aim 1: understand community stakeholder needs to inform software design and functionality; Aim 2: develop CBTpro digital content; and Aim 3: train and validate machine learning algorithms to automatically score CBTp fidelity. The objective of Phase II is to optimize and test the CBTpro tool in real world practice settings. Accordingly, in Phase II, we will Aim 1: conduct a lab usability study (Aim 1a) followed by field testing of the CBTpro prototype (Aim 1b) with 20 trainees; Aim 2: conduct a randomized controlled trial of CBTpro training vs. training as usual (N= 100 providers / N=300 clients), using a nested mixed model analysis to determine the effect of CBTpro on client symptoms, functioning, and recovery; and Aim 3: adopting an NIMH experimental therapeutics approach, assess the hypothesized mechanism by which CBTpro affects clinical outcomes through increased provider fidelity to CBTp (mediation), and test whether the strength of the relationship between these variables is affected by client skill acquisition (moderation). This proposal directly addresses the National Institute of Mental Health’s strategic objectives to improve dissemination, implementation, and continuous improvement of evidence-based mental health services (Objective 4.2) and develop innovative models to dramatically improve the outcomes of mental health services received (Objective 4.3), particularly through the use of novel technology. CBTpro has the potential to reduce the high personal and societal costs associated with serious mental illness, redress the challenges of training amidst high rates of mental health system turnover, support supervisors in quality assurance and improvement efforts, and reduce health disparities associated with mental health workforce shortage areas. Evidence based psychotherapeutic interventions are recommended by national psychosis treatment guidelines, but are inaccessible in routine practice. The objective of this proposal is to systematically develop, pilot, and rigorously test CBTpro, a novel clinician support tool designed to train community mental health workers to provide cognitive behavioral therapy for psychosis skills to their clients.

"Online system for identifying and addressing teen depression in primary care This proposal presents innovations to addressing teen depression during routine check-up visits through further development of an online clinical process support system called CHADIS. The primary care provider remains in the center of the process with his/her prior relationship with the family and humanity enabled with computer assistance prior to the encounter as well as moment of care reminders and teleprompted specific hints aimed at enhancing a patient focused balanced discussion of individual strengths and barriers to the teens goals known as a motivational interview. This is made feasible through pre-visit data collection providing relevant details to highlight as well as data to support omitting some traditional guidance areas with lower priority for the individual teen. Any conclusions coming from PCP recommendations and shared decision making is reinforced by a computer-based, always available chatbot guided by artificial intelligence that serves as a bridge to other helping professionals, strengths building resources, as well as conversations based on proven mental health therapies based on earlier pilot data for reducing depressive symptoms. These innovations will be tested via a cluster randomized control trial, demonstrating whether use of the system results in higher rates of screening, reductions in depressive symptoms, and accessing of evidence-based treatment for teen depression. Use of the system is reinforced by engagement of primary doctors and child psychiatrists in a related quality improvement program with data from their participation providing needed feedback for recertification of professional status requirements of their respective specialty boards. Success of the system would mean a new primary care workflow-friendly tool which could help adolescents avoid the significant functional impairment and increased risks that accompany teen depression. If this new paradigm for adolescent health supervision proves useful for depression, adaptations for other teen challenges might also be promising. Approximately 12.5% of U.S. 12-17 year olds had at least one major depressive episode in the past year. Yet, up to 70% of teens with mental health (MH) care needs do not receive necessary care.

"Deep machine learning to delineate trajectories of vulnerability and transition to mental illness in youth Most mental illness originates in youth: 50% of mental illness is diagnosed by the age of 14, and 75% by 24. Manifest illness emerges after a period of ~8-10 years. Remarkably, functional MRI can detect disrupted patterns of brain function associated with these vulnerable trajectories. However, the emergence of manifest mental illness reflects a complex and dynamic interplay of many biological, developmental, social and environmental factors that may be risky or protective, shared across illness categories, co-vary, and currently lack specificity. Moreover, the ability of fMRI and serial assessment to detect clinically-relevant shifts in dynamic risk trajectories of mental illness is poorly defined. Charting mental illness trajectories to optimize intervention is a critical need. A major obstacle is the identification of specific neural-behavioral risk pathways that shape vulnerable developmental trajectories into various categories of manifest mental illness. The long-term goal of my research is to develop computational approaches to advance our understanding of risk trajectories in the mental health of youth. Consequently, the overall objective of this study is to leverage advanced machine learning methods to illuminate dynamic trajectories of mental illness progression, to characterize sustained mental health and to quantify the incremental predictive value of serial and functional MRI assessment. My central hypothesis is that specific risk pathways that have specific brain functional correlates characterize discrete peri-adolescent trajectories in major mental illness categories. Further, that functional MRI metrics and serial assessment significantly improve case prediction. This study will leverage a new, unprecedented opportunity to dissect risk trajectories by applying deep machine learning to ‘big data’ from 20,000 diverse youth, including longitudinal data. I will characterize the behavior and specificity of dynamic risk trajectories and their functional neural correlates in 5 major peri-adolescent mental illness categories and determine the incremental predictive value of adding functional MRI to bio-psycho-social data and continuing assessment after age 10, the developmental inflection point for mental illness. Further innovation will accrue from the use of a cloud computing infrastructure to perform the research. My rationale is that elucidating specific risk trajectories and how to best monitor them in peri-adolescence will stimulate more refined prevention and early intervention strategies in youth mental health, known to improve outcomes and reduce resource use. Concomitantly, I will obtain capstone training in advanced machine learning methods, programming and cloud computing infrastructure, building on my KL2 training in machine learning, data science and the acquisition and analysis of fMRI and bio-psycho-social data. An interdisciplinary mentorship team of international experts in data science, developmental psychopathology, bioinformatics, epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of Washington will prepare me for my transition to independence as a physician-scientist working at the interface of computational science and population youth mental health, and as a child and adolescent psychiatrist specializing in neurodevelopmental disorders. Charting mental illness trajectories in community populations of diverse youth to optimize early intervention is a critical need in population mental health. The goal of this study is to leverage advanced machine learning methods in unique, new ‘big data’ from 20,000 diverse youth to illuminate dynamic trajectories of mental illness progression, to characterize sustained mental health and to quantify the incremental predictive value of serial and functional MRI assessment. The resulting body of work will elucidate specific dynamic risk trajectories and suggest how to monitor them in peri-adolescence and stimulate more refined prevention and early intervention strategies in youth mental health, known to improve outcomes and reduce resource use. !",Deep machine learning to delineate trajectories of vulnerability and transition to mental illness in youth,9981021,K99MH118359,"['abstracting ', ' Activities of Daily Living ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' daily living functionality ', ' functional ability ', ' functional capacity ', ' Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Goals ', ' Incidence ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mentorship ', ' Physicians ', ' Psychiatrist ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Shapes ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' psychosocial ', ' Performance ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Categories ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' social ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' psychosocial assessment ', ' psychosocial care ', ' psychosocial studies ', ' psychosocial support ', ' Psychosocial Assessment and Care ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Cognitive ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Neurological Development Disorder ', ' Neurodevelopmental Disorder ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Computational Science ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' 10 years of age ', ' age 10 years ', ' ten year old ', ' ten years of age ', ' 10 year old ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' high risk ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' Cloud Infrastructure ', ' cloud computer ', ' Cloud Computing ', ' Major Mental Illness ', ' BigData ', ' Big Data ', ' neural correlate ', ' Data Science ', ' improved outcome ', ' symptom cluster ', ' artificial neural net ', ' computational neural network ', ' synthetic neural network ', ' artificial neural network ', ' deep learning ', ' Infrastructure ', ' periadolescent ', ' social factors ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K99,2020,156897,WA-07,0.1343066082039882
"Estimating Population Effects in Mental Health Research Using Meta-Analysis Dr. Hwanhee Hong is a post-doctoral fellow in the Department of Mental Health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Dr. Hong obtained statistical background for biomedical research from the University of Minnesota and Harvard School of Public Health, where she completed a PhD and a MS in biostatistics, respectively. This K99 training award will help her obtain critical knowledge in mental health research and focused statistical methods to accomplish the proposed project. The proposed project aims to (1) develop statistical methods for estimating population treatment effects in the context of mental health, integrating meta-analytic techniques with a number of existing survey data analysis methods and generalizability methods for a single randomized trial, (2) validate and assess performance of the proposed methods, and apply them to real investigative randomized trials for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and (3) extend the proposed methods to network meta-analysis, comparing multiple treatments at once, for finding the best treatment for the general population. This project will enhance the use of clinical trials and meta-analyses in mental health, yielding methods to make better decisions about intervention implementation in general populations, which fits the National Institute of Mental Health’s mission. The two-year mentored training program consists of organized mentorship with regular in-person individual meetings, team meetings, formal coursework in both mental health and biostatistics, seminars, working groups, academic conferences, and career development activities. These training activities will provide the groundwork for the following three-year independent stage. Short-term career goals include to establish a better understanding of mental health research, particularly complex features of mental disorders and outcomes from relevant clinical trials, advanced topics in causal inference, and additional statistical methods for generalizing results of meta-analyses including survey weighting and flexible machine learning methods. Long-term career goals include to build an independent research portfolio and become a leading methodologist in mental health and other multidisciplinary research. The Department of Mental Health of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health provides an ideal setting for training a new independent methodologist in mental health with an extensive program of formal and informal education for post-doctoral researchers, opportunities for collaboration with researchers having expertise in diverse areas, and resources for career development. Dr. Hong will also use all available resources from other Departments including biostatistics, epidemiology, and psychiatry. This environment maximizes the potential for Dr. Hong to obtain the necessary training and perform the research to establish herself as a skilled investigator with an independent research program. This project will help mental health researchers generalize, apply, and implement findings from meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials to target populations. Traditional meta-analyses enable us to borrow strength across multiple studies to gain more power, resulting in reliable and precise effect estimates; however they do not consider how well the trials represent target populations of interest. By developing methods to help generalize the results of meta-analyses, we will help translate results into appropriate decisions regarding broad implementation and clinical practice.",Estimating Population Effects in Mental Health Research Using Meta-Analysis,9935960,R00MH111807,"['Award ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Sources ', ' Decision Making ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Minnesota ', ' Mission ', ' Persons ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Placebos ', ' Sham Treatment ', ' sham therapy ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Safety ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Target Populations ', ' Training Activity ', ' training module ', ' Training Programs ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' symposium ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Bayesian computation ', ' Bayesian inference ', ' Bayesian network analysis ', ' Bayesian spatial analysis ', ' Bayesian statistical analysis ', ' Bayesian statistical inference ', ' Bayesian statistics ', ' Bayesian Analysis ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Collaborations ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' Postdoc ', ' Research Associate ', ' post-doc ', ' post-doctoral ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' Performance ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' career development ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Data ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' trial regimen ', ' trial treatment ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' Characteristics ', ' work group ', ' working group ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' treatment effect ', ' evidence base ', ' standard of care ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' clinical practice ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' Randomization trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' RDoC ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' Bayesian adaptive designs ', ' Bayesian adaptive models ', ' Bayesian belief network ', ' Bayesian belief updating model ', ' Bayesian framework ', ' Bayesian hierarchical model ', ' Bayesian network model ', ' Bayesian nonparametric models ', ' Bayesian spatial data model ', ' Bayesian spatial image models ', ' Bayesian spatial models ', ' Bayesian statistical models ', ' Bayesian tracking algorithms ', ' Bayesian Modeling ', ' Positive Valence ', ' Negative Valence ', ' precision interventions ', ' personalized intervention ', ' informal education ', ' informal instruction ', ' informal learning ', ' open-source data ', ' open science ', ' open data ', ' data access ', ' regression trees ', ' machine learning method ', ' randomized controlled design ', ' ']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R00,2020,248999,NC-04,0.2593580618205454
"Dual Mechanisms of Cognitive Control This project focuses on understanding the psychological and neural mechanisms that give rise to cognitive control. Cognitive control processes are a component of human mental function that is fundamentally important in a wide range of domains, including attention, working memory, episodic memory, and decision making. Cognitive control disruptions are thought to be a major source of functional impairment for individuals suffering from a variety of mental health disorders and neuropsychiatric diseases, which is why they feature prominently in the NIMH RDoC matrix. Over the last decade, we have developed a theoretically coherent and mechanistic model, the Dual Mechanisms of Control (DMC) framework, which has the following core tenets: 1) cognitive control can operate in distinct modes, proactive and reactive; 2) these modes are associated with unique dynamic neural signatures, involving a shift between sustained and transient engagement of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and its interactions with the cingulo-opercular network (CON) and fronto-striatal circuitry; 3) they represent a core dimension of variability, present across a range of cognitive domains (i.e., indicating a psychologically coherent construct); 4) this variability is both state-related (and thus affected by task/situation and endogenous factors) and trait-related (a key component of individual variation); and 5) the variation encompasses cognitive control function in healthy young adults, but also in more extreme forms, contributes to dysfunction present in various impaired populations (e.g., schizophrenia, depression, ADHD, aging). Under a current MERIT award, we have been directly testing these core tenets of the DMC framework, through a large-scale project, which samples monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs and participants from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and to comprehensively characterize proactive and reactive control at the behavioral, neural, and genetic levels. The current proposal takes full advantage of the extensive infrastructure we have already developed for this project to dramatically expand its scope, explanatory depth, and utility to the scientific community. Specifically, we propose a rigorous, multi-pronged study, that integrates our optimized cognitive control task battery with mindfulness skills training (MT), a longitudinal design with repeated neuroimaging assessments, comprehensive “neuro-psychometric” characterization of individual variation utilizing state-of-the-art analytic techniques, and incorporation of current best practices (i.e., following Open Science Framework [OSF] recommendations), to maximize the transparency, reproducibility, and ease of dissemination of project tools and findings. Success is in this effort will have important theoretical and clinical implications, by providing a clearer understanding of the sources of normal human variation, and even more importantly, highlighting potential risk vulnerability factors for a range of mental health disorders. This project will provide detailed information regarding the brain-basis of normal human variation in higher mental functions such as attention, memory and decision-making, and how such functions are impacted by positive lifestyle interventions (i.e., mindfulness training). This information has high relevance for public health by furthering our understanding of the relationship between mental health and illness (e.g.,  schizophrenia, depression) and of the vulnerability and protective factors that contribute to mental illness risk.",Dual Mechanisms of Cognitive Control,9906925,R37MH066078,"['primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Attention ', ' Award ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Communities ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Striatum ', ' striatal ', ' Decision Making ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Insula of Reil ', ' Central Lobe ', ' Insula ', ' Island of Reil ', ' Memory ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' working memory ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Parkinson ', "" Parkinson's disease "", ' Parkinsons disease ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Recommendation ', ' Risk ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Standardization ', ' Task Performances ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Twin Multiple Birth ', ' Twins ', ' Monozygotic twins ', ' Identical Twins ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' analytical method ', ' Anterior ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Non-linear Dynamic ', ' Non-linear Dynamics ', ' Nonlinear Dynamic ', ' Nonlinear Dynamics ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' young adult ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Dimensions ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' Equation ', ' skills training ', ' Episodic memory ', ' success ', ' cingulate cortex ', ' neural control ', ' neural regulation ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuroregulation ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' Functional impairment ', ' functional disability ', ' AD/HD ', ' ADHD ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' Cognitive ', ' Endogenous Factors ', ' Scheme ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' improved functioning ', ' psychological outcomes ', ' Population ', ' Individual Differences ', ' neural mechanism ', ' neuromechanism ', ' life style intervention ', ' lifestyle intervention ', ' Impairment ', ' cognitive control ', ' public health relevance ', ' mindfulness ', ' cognitive enhancement ', ' longitudinal design ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' RDoC ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' mental function ', ' causal diagram ', ' causal model ', ' project dissemination ', ' program dissemination ', ' dynamical system ', ' dynamic system ', ' open-source data ', ' open science ', ' open data ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' connectome ', ' Mindfulness Approach ', ' Mindfulness Therapy ', ' Mindfulness Treatment ', ' Mindfulness-based Approach ', ' Mindfulness-based Therapy ', ' Mindfulness-based Training ', ' Mindfulness-based Treatment ', ' Mindfulness Training ', ' protective factors ', ' individual heterogeneity ', ' individual variability ', ' individual variation ', ' Infrastructure ', ' machine learning method ', ' Affect ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' ']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R37,2020,660316,MO-01,0.17623689524690767
"Developing an Optimized Conversational Agent or ""Chatbot"" to Facilitate Mental Health Services Use in Individuals with Eating Disorders PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Eating disorders (EDs) are serious mental illnesses associated with high morbidity and mortality, clinical impairment, and comorbid psychopathology. Although evidence-based treatments for EDs have been established, the treatment gap is wide. Indeed, <20% of individuals with EDs receive treatment. We need a novel solution not only to identify individuals with EDs but also to encourage mental health services use and address treatment barriers. I have established a strong working relationship with the National EDs Association (NEDA), the U.S.'s leading non-profit for EDs, to offer our group's online, evidence-based EDs screen on the NEDA website. Over one year, the NEDA screen was completed >200,000 times. Among screen respondents, the vast majority screen positive for an ED, but of those, most are not in treatment, and only a small percentage click to learn more about one of the options for seeking intervention presented in the screening feedback. I propose a research agenda to design a conversational agent or “chatbot” that is optimized to increase mental health services use among individuals with EDs through such features as: 1) providing a personalized recommendation for seeking intervention; 2) engaging the user in motivational interviewing to overcome barriers to care; and 3) repeated check-ins with the user to encourage follow-up with care. This research agenda aligns with NIMH's focus on services research and interest in technology-driven approaches to promote engagement with care. I will conduct two studies. First, I will utilize a user-centered design approach to create a prototype chatbot and conduct usability testing with adults with EDs to inform chatbot refinements (Aim 1). Second, I will conduct a randomized optimization trial with adults who have completed screening on the NEDA website and screen positive for an ED but are not in treatment to determine chatbot feasibility and to generate data on the effect of the chatbot on motivation for treatment post-initial chatbot use and motivation for treatment and mental health services use at 1- and 3-month follow-ups (Aims 2 & 3). This trial will employ the Multiphase Optimization Strategy framework, using a 23 full factorial design, to randomly assign participants to a combination of the three proposed intervention components (n=8 conditions) to isolate the active ingredients. These aims support my training plan in which I will receive expert mentorship and training in: services research and implementation science (Training Goal 1); user-centered design and usability testing, as well as exposure to machine learning (Training Goal 2); novel trial designs (Training Goal 3); and advanced statistical techniques for analyzing longitudinal trial and digital innovation data (Training Goal 4). My expert mentorship team, along with the environment of Washington University, will ensure my success. Results from the proposed study will be used to optimize the chatbot, which I will then test in a subsequent R01 randomized controlled trial. This K08 will equip me with the skills to become a leader in addressing the research-practice and treatment gaps for EDs, with a focus on digital innovations. PROJECT NARRATIVE Eating disorders are serious mental illnesses, but less than 20% of individuals receive treatment. I propose a research agenda to design a conversational agent or “chatbot” for increasing mental health services use among individuals with eating disorders, with study data being used to optimize the chatbot for a subsequent R01 randomized controlled trial. This K08 will not only result in the development of a highly scalable solution for facilitating mental health services use among individuals with eating disorders that has potential for widespread dissemination through partnership with the National Eating Disorders Association, but it will also result in an independent research program that addresses critical gaps in the treatment of eating disorders, with a focus on digital innovation solutions.","Developing an Optimized Conversational Agent or ""Chatbot"" to Facilitate Mental Health Services Use in Individuals with Eating Disorders",9955368,K08MH120341,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' computer program ', ' computer programming ', ' Eating Disorders ', ' Environment ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Health Services Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' services research ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Learning ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mentorship ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Motivation ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Partnership Practice ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prognosis ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Recommendation ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Support ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Work ', ' Caring ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Respondent ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Exposure to ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' motivational interview ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' Health Care Technology ', ' Healthcare Technology ', ' Health Technology ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Experimental Therapies ', ' Investigational Treatments ', ' experimental therapeutic agents ', ' experimental therapeutics ', ' Investigational Therapies ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Evidence based treatment ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' digital ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' chronic mental illness ', ' persistent mental illness ', ' serious mental disorder ', ' serious mental illness ', ' severe mental disorder ', ' severe mental illness ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' user centered design ', ' usability ', ' implementation science ', ' prototype ', ' evidence base ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' screening ', ' precision interventions ', ' personalized intervention ', ' trial design ', ' health service utilization ', ' health service use ', ' short message service ', ' texting ', ' Text Messaging ', ' barrier to health care ', ' barrier to healthcare ', ' barrier to treatment ', ' obstacle to care ', ' obstacle to healthcare ', ' barrier to care ', ' service delivery ', ' Facebook ', ' chat bot ', ' chatbot ', ' multiphase optimization strategy ', ' ']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K08,2020,179096,MO-01,0.11131000413118862
"Developing a Data-Driven Management System Using Machine Learning and Mixed-Methods Research to Predict Job Turnover Among MentalHealth Professionals Project Summary/Abstract The main goal of this study is to build a data-driven, evidence-based organizational management system that can inform effective recruitment and retention strategies to prevent excessive turnover. High turnover rates (estimated 25-60% annually) are devastating for mental health care systems, affecting organizations (e.g., cost), employees (e.g., work well-being), and most critically, the quality of care. Human resource departments collect extensive employee data that can be useful predictors for turnover, but these data are not often analyzed to address turnover issues in mental health organizations. Computational methods have greatly evolved and can now access and analyze large and complex data. This pilot study will achieve three specific aims: Aim 1: build and test turnover prediction models by developing and applying machine learning algorithms to existing human resource data; Aim 2: generate critical questions to enhance turnover prediction through qualitative methods; and Aim 3: test the enhanced model in predicting turnover at 12 months. In Aim 1, using past human resource data and service encounters from [two mental health organizations (rural and urban locations)], we will develop machine learning algorithms to predict turnover. The algorithms will address turnover questions simultaneously (e.g., Who are the most likely to leave? What factors predict turnover at varying time points in employment?). In Aim 2, we will interview key informants: “leavers” (employees who voluntarily terminate employment during the study); “stayers” (employees with extreme longevity in the organization); and “predictees” (identified as likely to leave, based on our algorithms). The findings will be discussed in two focus groups in order to generate, refine, and validate 5-10 critical questions to enhance prediction of turnover. In Aim 3, we will conduct an on-line survey of all current employees to assess the 5-10 critical questions and link survey data with data from human resources and services to examine the improved precision between the theory-based model (predictors in the survey) and the data-driven model (machine learning algorithms) in predicting actual turnover 12 months later. Machine learning can model complex and dynamic variable relationships (e.g., handling a large number of variables, accounting for heterogeneity) and overcome limitations in traditional turnover research that often relies on small, cross-sectional, and convenience samples. Successful completion of this study will promote data-driven, evidence-based organizational management practices to address turnover, which is aligned with NIMH priorities of capitalizing on existing data structures and using technologies to improve mental health service quality. This study will be a critical step in developing highly adaptable machine learning algorithms to predict turnover; ultimately, we envision that this system will be partnered with future clinical interventions to reduce turnover in mental health. Project Narrative This pilot study will build a data-driven, evidence-based organizational management system to inform effective recruitment and retention strategies for preventing excessive employee turnover in mental health organizations. Successful retention of a quality workforce not only helps mental health organizations and their employees, but also directly impacts the quality of care that clients receive. In addition, a data-driven, evidence-based organizational management system could be partnered with clinical interventions to reduce turnover.",Developing a Data-Driven Management System Using Machine Learning and Mixed-Methods Research to Predict Job Turnover Among MentalHealth Professionals,9895943,R34MH119411,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Professional Burnout ', ' Client ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Community Mental Health Centers ', ' CMHC ', ' Computer Systems ', ' computing system ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Data Sources ', ' Employment ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Services Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' services research ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Interview ', ' Investments ', ' Job Satisfaction ', ' Work Satisfaction ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Occupations ', ' Jobs ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Personnel Turnover ', ' Employee Turnover ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Productivity ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' mental health organization ', ' rural region ', ' rural area ', ' urban area ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Compensation ', ' Financial compensation ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' Rural ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' burn-out ', ' burnout ', ' Services ', ' human data ', ' Performance ', ' Employee ', ' Practice Management ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' Manpower ', ' personnel ', ' Human Resources ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' informant ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' cost ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prospective ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' evidence base ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' retention strategy ', ' student retention ', ' retention rate ', ' data resource ', ' recruit ', ' treatment services ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' data heterogeneity ', ' data set heterogeneity ', ' dataset heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneous data ', ' heterogeneous data sets ', ' heterogeneous datasets ', ' heterogenous data sets ', ' heterogenous datasets ', ' heterogenous data ', ' structured data ', ' complex data  ', ' ']",NIMH,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R34,2020,244635,IN-07,0.18258665876645538
"Generalizing and Standardizing fMRI Tools for Differentiating Mental Illnesses and Predicting Medication-Class Response in Patients Project Summary/Abstract  Mood disorders, like many psychiatric conditions, have their onset in emerging adulthood and often last a lifetime. Mental illnesses have an excessively large loading of Disability Adjusted Life Years, making early intervention crucial for both individuals and society. Differentiating bipolar disorder (BD) from major depressive disorder (MDD) based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) can be especially challenging if clear mania is absent. In fact, BD patients go an average of 6-10 years without the proper diagnosis, with 70% misdiagnosed with MDD instead. The challenge of identifying BD patients among depressed individuals is complex but critical because diagnosis determines treatment. The use of antidepressant (AD) medications in patients with BD can lead to worsening of illness. We have recently shown that, using resting fMRI, we can predict future medication class response with high accuracy (> 90%). In this project we will build on this work to generalize to a new MRI scanner and clinical assessment protocol. In addition we will develop, in consultation with multiple psychiatrists, a cloud-based tool to analyze and report the results from the brain imaging protocol and machine learning analysis, in a timely, meaningful, and interpretable manner. Results are expected to be an important step forward in the eventual development of clinical useful markers of mental illness. 2 Project Narrative  Patients with mood disorders will often spend months to years on the wrong medication, which can also make them worse (e.g., putting individuals with bipolar disorder on antidepressants). There is a great need to develop biomarkers of treatment response in mental illness. This work will build on recent work from our group showing over 90% accuracy using resting fMRI predictors to further generalize the results to multiple scanners and develop an online portal to process and provide reporting of results (classification results) as well as processed data and citation information.",Generalizing and Standardizing fMRI Tools for Differentiating Mental Illnesses

"Socioemotional Processing and Aggression Project Summary/Abstract Complex relationships exist between mental illness and aggression, particularly interpersonal aggression that can lead to antisocial behavior. Unfortunately, conducting high-impact mental health research among those who have committed serious aggressive acts against persons has been strategically challenging for many reasons. This research plan employs unique resources that enable advanced cognitive neuroscience research to be conducted in forensic environments. Here we leverage these resources to examine impaired functioning of neural circuits that contribute to specific varieties of serious aggressive behavior. Callous and unemotional traits, impulsive/disinhibited behavior, and appetitive desire to harm others, all have identifiable roots in neurocognitive function. We will examine how clinical levels of these latter traits are related to abnormalities in the neural circuits involved in affective perspective taking, moral decision-making, and behavioral inhibition. Normative neural responses for each of these processes have been well-characterized by our prior work. We seek to differentiate between unique pathophysiological etiologies that contribute to specific behavioral tendencies. We further aim to elucidate the modifying influence of early childhood trauma in these neurocognitive domains. Understanding these differences will promote more sophisticated prevention and intervention strategies that incorporate specific knowledge of neurocognitive vulnerabilities and remedial approaches for improving long-range outcomes for individuals and for the public. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Aggressive behavior is a major public health concern that intersects with challenging venues of mental health research. This research plan implements unique resources to carry out cognitive neuroscience research among highly aggressive inmates with mental illnesses to differentiate among several etiological trajectories promoting these behaviors. The outcomes of this work will foster more sophisticated strategies for recognizing the potential for aggression and implementing more effective interventions, with the ultimate goal of preventing aggression and victimization in society.",Socioemotional Processing and Aggression,9831645,R01MH114028,"['Accounting ', ' Aggressive behavior ', ' Aggression ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Desire for food ', ' Appetite ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Cognition ', ' Decision Making ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Emotions ', ' Empathy ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Forensic Medicine ', ' Forensics ', ' Goals ', ' Judgment ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mentally Ill Persons ', ' Mental Patients ', ' Mentally Ill ', ' Methods ', ' Morals ', ' Motivation ', ' Multivariate Analysis ', ' Multivariate Analyses ', ' Persons ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Paraphilias ', ' Pathology ', ' Perception ', ' Public Health ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Sampling Studies ', ' Societies ', ' Suggestion ', ' Temporal Lobe ', ' temporal cortex ', ' Work ', ' case report ', ' Case Study ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' morphometry ', ' brain visualization ', ' Brain imaging ', ' Anterior ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Personal awareness ', ' Self image ', ' Self view ', ' self awareness ', ' self knowledge ', ' Self Perception ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Functional disorder ', ' mental status ', ' mental state ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Behavioral Manipulation ', ' behavioral control ', ' Behavior Control ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Victimization ', ' Dimensions ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' experience ', ' early childhood ', ' cohort ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' criminal offender ', ' offender ', ' neural function ', ' Neurophysiology - biologic function ', ' antisocial ', ' anti social ', ' Ventral Striatum ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Brain region ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Mind Research ', ' Mind/Body Research ', ' mind-body research ', ' mind/body method ', ' Mind-Body Method ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Cognitive ', ' Neurosciences Research ', ' Pathologic ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' callous unemotional trait ', ' adolescent trauma ', ' childhood trauma ', ' trauma in children ', ' pediatric trauma ', ' neglect ', ' behavioral monitoring ', ' Behavior monitoring ', ' Behavioral inhibition ', ' Outcome ', ' independent component analysis ', ' cognitive neuroscience ', ' Impairment ', ' Affective ', ' data structure ', ' cognitive control ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' treatment strategy ', ' neural patterning ', ' prevent aggression ', ' aggression prevention ', ' Secure ', ' RDoC ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' Social Processes ', ' antisocial behavior ', ' trait impulsivity ', ' Preventative measure ', ' Preventive measure ', ' Preventative treatment ', ' Preventive treatment ', ' symptomatology ', ' multi-modal data ', ' multi-modal datasets ', ' multimodal datasets ', ' multimodal data ', ' ']",NIMH,THE MIND RESEARCH NETWORK,R01,2020,698835,NM-01,0.04988499371777869
"Computational ontology of brain systems across the human neuroimaging literature Project Summary/Abstract Symptom-based diagnoses of mental illness are highly comorbid, biologically heterogeneous, and poorly predictive of treatment response. The National Institute of Mental Health has led efforts to redefine mental illness by its biological causes, establishing the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework as a guide for investigating variation in basic brain systems. RDoC has been influential, named in hundreds of grants and publications, but it has yet to be systematically validated. It is unknown whether circuit-function links underlying the RDoC brain systems are reproducible across studies, and organizing principles remain largely untested. While the structure of RDoC as a modular hierarchy has evidence in resting state analyses, it has not been shown whether this applies to systems that support the diverse mental states affected in psychiatric disease. It is necessary to validate RDoC, and moreover, to establish fundamental principles of organization for systems defined jointly by human brain structure and function. The objective of this proposal is to apply large- scale computational neuroimaging meta-analyses to build a data-driven ontology that will not only serve as a benchmark in evaluating the validity of RDoC but also characterize the architecture of systems for human brain function. The long-term goal is to redefine mental illness by differences from healthy function within the brain systems of a data-driven ontology, facilitating rational targeting of neuromodulation treatments. The proposed meta-analyses will be the most comprehensive in the field with 18,155 MRI and PET studies already collected. The mental functions considered in these studies have been extracted from article texts using natural language processing, and brain circuits will be mapped from the brain coordinate data that were reported. The hypothesis is that brain systems are comprised of reproducible circuit-function links organized into a modular hierarchy, which for some systems will require updates to RDoC. This will be tested by comparing RDoC systems against those of a data-driven ontology. Aim 1: The reproducibility of circuit-function links will be evaluated by the performance of neural network classifiers predicting functions in article texts from circuits in brain scan data, and vice versa. Aim 2: The modularity of brain systems will be evaluated by a graph theoretic approach, and hierarchical structure will be assessed by representational similarity analysis. The impact of this project will be to validate the foremost psychiatry research framework and to characterize human brain systems through an innovative computational strategy. Together with targeted academic training in neurobiology, the fellowship is designed to offer preparation for a career as a physician-scientist leading advances in computational psychiatry. Training will be supported by an environment that combines world-class computing resources with esteemed and engaged mentors in psychiatry, neuroscience, and computer science. Project Narrative First-line treatments routinely fail for most of the 45 million US adults living with mental illness because psychiatric diagnoses lack a biological basis, making them unreliable predictors of treatment response. The proposed project will lay the foundation for a biologically based diagnostic system in psychiatry by characterizing the composition and structure of human brain systems through innovative computational meta-analyses of nearly 20,000 neuroimaging articles. When it is understood what makes up a brain system and how systems are organized, mental illness can be redefined by variation from healthy function, facilitating successful targeting of brain-based treatments.",Computational ontology of brain systems across the human neuroimaging literature,9991669,F30MH120956,"['Academic Training ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Biology ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Environment ', ' Fellowship ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Influentials ', ' Literature ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Maps ', ' Mentors ', ' Names ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Physicians ', ' Positron-Emission Tomography ', ' PET ', ' PET Scan ', ' PET imaging ', ' PETSCAN ', ' PETT ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Medical Imaging ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Scan ', ' Rad.-PET ', ' positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging ', ' positron emission tomographic imaging ', ' positron emitting tomography ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rest ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' mental status ', ' mental state ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Psychiatric Diagnosis ', ' Scientist ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Brain scan ', ' Performance ', ' neural control ', ' neural regulation ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuroregulation ', ' computer science ', ' Expert Opinion ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' Graph ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Social Support System ', ' Support System ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Brain region ', ' Symptoms ', ' Base of the Brain ', ' Data ', ' Higher Order Chromatin Folding ', ' Higher Order Structure ', ' Higher Order Chromatin Structure ', ' predict therapeutic response ', ' predict therapy response ', ' predict treatment response ', ' therapy prediction ', ' treatment prediction ', ' treatment response prediction ', ' Prediction of Response to Therapy ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Cognitive ', ' Ontology ', ' Scheme ', ' Update ', ' Preparation ', ' Text ', ' neuroinformatics ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' computational resources ', ' computing resources ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' system architecture ', ' RDoC ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' mental function ', ' brain circuitry ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' learning strategy ', ' deep learning ', ' neural network classifier ', ' ']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F30,2020,37706,CA-18,0.1027748188555098
"The neural bases of placebo effects and their relation to regulatory processes Placebo treatments can induce clinically significant benefits, compared with no-treatment controls, across a variety of disorders. But placebo treatments themselves are pharmacologically and physically inert: Their benefits result from active brain and psychological responses to the treatment context. Neuroscientific studies have established that placebo treatments influence cortical-subcortical brain pathways and neurochemical systems relevant for expectation, appraisals of personal and social meaning, and value-driven learning. These systems are also related to symptom progression across mental health disorders and several other neurological and substance use disorders. Understanding the brain and psychological mechanisms of placebo effects will help improve psychological and neurological (e.g., neuromodulation-based) treatments across disorders. This R01 renewal funds an ongoing program of research that has made fundamental contributions to this literature. It has also identified several significant gaps that are particularly important for connecting placebo research to mental health. One gap is that our understanding of the brain mechanisms underlying placebo effects comes almost purely from studies of pain. The proposed studies extend previous work to study the brain pathways underlying placebo effects in anxiety and social rejection, negative affective processes directly relevant for multiple mental health disorders. Pattern-recognition (machine learning) analyses identify the most symptom-relevant pathways, and test effects of placebo and other context interventions on these pathways. In Aim 1 (Experiments 1-3), we develop models across multiple affective symptoms, parsing affective pathways into those that are symptom-specific and those that generalize across multiple symptoms and outcomes. We also address the role of endogenous opioids, strongly linked to placebo analgesia, in other negative affective experiences. Another gap is that most previous studies of the context variables that drive strong placebo effects—including social influences, treatment history—have not been studied extensively at the brain level. In Aim 2, we study the brain pathways underlying several promising context interventions that enhance the strength of placebo effects, including social modeling of successful or unsuccessful treatment response, initial experiences of treatment success or failure, and the match between placebo suggestions and a person’s predisposition to be receptive to them. Project narrative Though placebo treatments are pharmacologically inert, placebo treatments induce active neurobiological processes related to patients’ expectations, learned associations, perceived care and support, and hope for the future. Studying placebo treatments provides a window into these crucial context variables that will help understand vulnerability and resilience to mental health disorders and beyond. This project continues a successful program of research on the brain mechanisms of placebo effects, taking the work in new directions critical for understanding mental health.",The neural bases of placebo effects and their relation to regulatory processes,9842001,R01MH076136,"['Affect ', ' Affective Symptoms ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Anxiety ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Conceptions ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Emotions ', ' Future ', ' Grant ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Joints ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Deception ', ' Masks ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Motivation ', ' Naloxone ', ' Persons ', ' Neural Pathways ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' neurochemistry ', ' neurochemical ', ' Neuronal Plasticity ', ' CNS plasticity ', ' central nervous system plasticity ', ' neural plasticity ', ' neuroplastic ', ' neuroplasticity ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Parkinson ', "" Parkinson's disease "", ' Parkinsons disease ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Physiology ', ' Placebo Effect ', ' expectancy effect ', ' expectation effect ', ' nocebo ', ' placebo response ', ' Placebos ', ' Sham Treatment ', ' sham therapy ', ' Psychotherapy ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Wages ', ' Salaries ', ' Sleep ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Suggestion ', ' Taste Perception ', ' Gustation ', ' Taste ', ' gustatory perception ', ' gustatory processing ', ' gustatory response ', ' taste processing ', ' taste response ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Mediating ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' endogenous opiate ', ' endogenous opioids ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Shapes ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' programs ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' gastrointestinal function ', ' experience ', ' social model ', ' success ', ' neural control ', ' neural regulation ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuroregulation ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' expectation ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' Participant ', ' social ', ' brain pathway ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' clinical depression ', ' major depression ', ' major depression disorder ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' trial regimen ', ' trial treatment ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' Cognitive ', ' Pattern Recognition ', ' Pharmacological Treatment ', ' Process ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' active technique ', ' active treatment ', ' active method ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Expectancy ', ' neural mechanism ', ' neuromechanism ', ' Affective ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinically significant ', ' patient expectation ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' treatment response ', ' clinical practice ', ' Social Anxiety Disorder ', ' negative affectivity ', ' negative affect ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' social interventions ', ' placebo analgesia ', ' ']",NIMH,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2020,797673,NH-02,0.17551585109179188
