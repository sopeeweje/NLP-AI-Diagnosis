"National Center: Multi-Scale Study of Cellular Networks(RMI)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A network of molecular interactions, involving many thousands of genes, their products, and other molecules, underlie cellular processes. Investigation of these interactions across a wide range of scales ranging from the formation/activation of transcriptional complexes, to the availability of a signaling pathway, all the way to macroscopic processes, such as cell adhesion, calls for a new level of sophistication in the design of genome- wide computational approaches. A homogeneous environment for the comprehensive mapping and analysis of molecular cellular interactions in would be a powerful resource for the biomedical research community. We propose the creation of a National Center for the Multiscale Analysis of Genomic and Cellular Networks (MAGNet). The Center will provide an integrative computational framework to organize molecular interactions in the cell into manageable context-dependent components and will develop interoperable computational models and tools that can leverage such a map of cellular interactions to elucidate important biological processes. Center activities will involve a significant, multidisciplinary effort of biological and computational sciences. Specific areas of expertise include natural language parsing (NLP), machine learning (ML), software systems and engineering, databases, computational structural biology, reverse engineering of genetic networks, biomedical literature datamining, and biomedical ontologies, among others. The Center will 1) construct an evidence integration framework to collect and fuse a variety of diverse cellular interaction clues based on their statistical relevance 2) assemble a comprehensive set of physics- and knowledge-based methodologies to fill this framework 3) provide a set of methodologies and filters, anchored in formal domain ontologies, to associated specific interactions to an organism, tissue, molecular, and cellular context. All relevant tools will be made accessible to the biomedical research community through a common, extensible, and interoperable software platform, geWorkbench. We will reach out to train and encourage researchers to use and/or develop new modules for, geWorkbench. An important element of the software platform will be the development of specific components that can exploit the evidence integration techniques developed by Core 9001 investigators to combine molecular interaction clues from Core 9002 algorithms and databases. Development will be both driven and tested by the biomedical community to ensure the usefulness of the tools and the usability of the graphical user interfaces to address biomedical problems in completely novel ways, to dissect the web of cellular interactions responsible for cellular processes and functions.

"Computer Studies of Protein Structure and Function    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goals of the proposed research include: a) The development of methods and associated computational tools that use three-dimensional structural information to predict protein function. b) The development of methods for the integration of structural information in the generation of networks of protein- protein interactions (interactomes). c) The application of structural information in the creation of an interactome of human and tumor B-cells and the use of this network in applications to B-cell Biology. These research goals are motivated by a number of factors. First, there is a general sense that structural information, as provided for example by the Protein Structure Initiative (PSI) is not fully exploited by the wider biological community. An interactive function prediction server is being developed with this issue in mind. Second, Structural Biology has not been fully integrated into Systems Biology approaches to predict protein networks and it would be extremely valuable to try to increase the integration of the two fields. Third, human B-cell phenomena are of great biological and medical interest and there is an exciting opportunity to incorporate structural information into this field in a novel way. A central element of the approach to be taken is the use of structural alignments to reveal novel functional relationships between proteins that have been classified as belonging to different protein ""folds"". Evidence is provided that there is a wealth of functional information in such remote relationships and computational tools to mine and visualize this information will be developed. The research design also includes the description of a novel approach to use structural alignments to identify potential protein-protein ligand, protein-protein and protein-DNA binding partners and to identify interfacial residues in the complexes they form. A novel scoring scheme for protein-protein interactions will be developed and a database of potential complexes, designed originally for human proteins, will be constructed. The database will also identify complexes that are unlikely to form. The information in this database will be incorporated into a Baysian inference scheme and used in the construction of a ""structure-enabled"" B-cell Interactome. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The relevance of the proposed research to public health lies in part in the insights, and accompanying methods, that will be provided about structure/function relationships in proteins. Specific applications to B-cell Biology have direct relevance to understanding a variety of B-cell related cancers.            The relevance of the proposed research to public health lies in part in the insights, and accompanying methods, that will be provided about structure/function relationships in proteins.

"Systems Biology of Plasmodium falciparum: Building and Exploring Network Models    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There is an urgent need for novel anti-malaria interventions, due to the growing resistance of Plasmodium parasites to available drugs. The long-term objective of our research is to identify potential drug or vaccine targets using an efficient and cost-effective data-mining approach. This proposed study is aimed at the identification of biological networks as the first step toward a systems-level understanding of parasite biology. Compared to functional genomics, which requires a priori information about the identity or function of targets, a systems-level understanding of parasite biology will allow us to identify targets based on their key roles in networks. Specific aim 1 focuses on the harvest of data relevant to three gene families: the proteases, transporters, and transcription factors that are essential components in cellular networks for parasite growth and infection. Our project will encompass genomic data, expression data, and data derived from other high throughput experiments and bioinformatic and statistical analyses. Specific aim 2 focuses on the integration and encapsulation of these data in the form of network models. The models will be inferred using probabilistic graphical methods drawn from the field of engineering. Specific aim 3 focuses on the exploration of these models, particularly in the light of data from wet lab gene mapping and drug resistance experiments. Our ""biological maps"" will enable the visualization of evolutionary forces driving changes in the parasite's phenotype and should allow us to identify network design weaknesses in the parasite--potential vulnerabilities that could result in new malarial control strategies.           ",Systems Biology of Plasmodium falciparum: Building and Exploring Network Models,7910601,SC1AI080579,"['Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Cell Cycle Regulation ', ' Cell Cycle Control ', ' computerized data processing ', ' signal processing ', ' data processing ', ' Digestion ', ' Drug resistance ', ' resistant to Drug ', ' resistance to Drug ', ' drug resistant ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' data mining ', ' datamining ', ' Transcription Factor 3 ', ' Transcription Factor E2-Alpha ', ' Kappa-E2-Binding Factor ', ' Immunoglobulin Transcription Factor 1 ', ' E2A Immunoglobulin Enhancer Binding Factor E47 ', ' E2A Immunoglobulin Enhancer Binding Factor E12 ', ' Elements ', ' Engineering ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Data ', ' Harvest ', ' Gene Family ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Family ', ' Genes ', ' Imagery ', ' Visualization ', ' base ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Hemoglobin ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' Infection ', ' insight ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Discipline ', ' Plant Roots ', ' root ', ' Malaria ', ' Plasmodium Infections ', ' Paludism ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Parasites ', ' Peptide Hydrolases ', ' Proteolytic Enzymes ', ' Proteinases ', ' Proteases ', ' Peptidases ', ' Esteroproteases ', ' Phenotype ', ' Plasmodium ', ' Plasmodium falciparum ', ' P.falciparum ', ' P. falciparum ', ' pressure ', ' Staging ', ' Electrical Engineering ', ' Proteins ', ' gene product ', ' Antimalarials ', ' Antimalarial Drugs ', ' Antimalarial Agents ', ' Anti-Malarials ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' programs ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Testing ', ' transcription factor ', ' Vaccines ', ' Work ', ' Immune ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Location ', ' Beryllium ', ' Be element ', ' Biology ', ' experience ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' trafficking ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Gene Proteins ', ' Protein Gene Products ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Open Reading Frames ', ' Protein Coding Region ', ' ORFs ', ' Chromosome Mapping ', ' genetic mapping ', ' Total Human and Non-Human Gene Mapping ', ' Linkage Mapping ', ' Gene Mapping Genetics ', ' Gene Mapping ', ' Gene Localization ', ' Mediating ', ' Modeling ', ' Specialist ', ' Property ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Proteomics ', ' functional genomics ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Genomics ', ' Be++ element ', ' cost ', ' data integration ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Rupture ', ' quantum ', ' Prevalence ', ' driving force ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' transcriptomics ', ' stem ', ' network models ', ' prototype ', ' biological systems ', ' comparative genomics ', ' ']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS SAN ANTONIO,SC1,2010,240491,TX-20,-0.021747522930669737

"Integrating Microarray and Proteomic Data by Ontology-based Annotation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       With the completion of the Human Genome Project, there is a need to translate genome-era discoveries into clinical utility. One difficulty in making bench-to-bedside translations with gene-expression and proteomic data is our current inability to relate these findings with each other and with clinical measurements. A translational researcher studying a particular biological process using microarrays or proteomics will want to gather as many relevant publicly-available data sets as possible, to compare findings. Translational investigators wanting to relate clinical or chemical data with multiple genomic or proteomic measurements will want to find and join related data sets. Unfortunately, finding and joining relevant data sets is particularly challenging today, as the useful annotations of this data are still represented only by unstructured free-text, limiting its secondary use. A question we have sought to answer is whether prior investments in biomedical ontologies can provide leverage in determining the context of genomic data in an automated manner, thereby enabling integration of gene expression and proteomic data and the secondary use of genomic data in multiple fields of research beyond those for which the data sets were originally targeted. The three specific aims to address this question are to (1) develop tools that comprehensively map contextual annotations to the largest biomedical ontology, the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), built and supported by the National Library of Medicine, validate, and disseminate the mappings, (2) execute a four-pronged strategy to evaluate experiment-concept mappings, and (3) apply experiment-context mappings to find and integrate data within and across microarray and proteomics repositories. To keep these tools relevant to biomedical investigators, we have included three Driving Biological Projects (DBPs), in the domains of breast cancer, organ transplantation, and T-cell biology. To accomplish these DBPs, our tools and mappings will be used to find and join experimental data within and across microarray and proteomic repositories. Having DBPs to address will focus our development on a set of scalable tools that can access and analyze experimental data covering a large variety of diseases. Through our advisory committee of world-renowned NIH-funded investigators, we will ensure that our findings will have broad applicability and are useful to a wide variety of biomedical researchers.          ",Integrating Microarray and Proteomic Data by Ontology-based Annotation,7929664,R01LM009719,"['Databases ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Manuals ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Molecular Biology ', ' DNA Molecular Biology ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Library of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' United States National Library of Medicine ', ' National Medical Library ', ' National Library of Medicine ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' Online Systems ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Organ Transplantation ', ' organ xenograft ', ' organ graft ', ' organ allograft ', ' Transplantation Surgery ', ' Organ Transplants, Including Bone Marrow for DCT ', ' Organ Transplants ', ' Grafting Procedure ', ' Clinical, Transplantation, Organ ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' tool ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Nature ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Computer software ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Specificity ', ' T-Lymphocyte ', ' thymus derived lymphocyte ', ' Thymus-Dependent Lymphocytes ', ' T-Cells ', ' Cellular biology ', ' cell biology ', ' Scientist ', ' Time ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' Writing ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Cells ', ' Unified Medical Language System ', ' UMLS ', ' Sampling ', ' Proteomics ', ' repository ', ' Genomics ', ' biomedical informatics ', ' biomed informatics ', ' translational medicine ', ' bench to bedside ', ' bench to bed side ', ' bench bedside ', ' bench bed side ', ' genome-wide ', ' genomewide ', ' biomedical ontology ', ' text searching ', ' text mining ', ' literature searching ', ' literature mining ', ' discovery mining ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Address ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Improve Access ', ' International ', ' Ontology ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Task Forces ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genome ', ' base ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' improved ', ' Head ', ' Human Genome Project ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Ensure ', ' Investments ', ' Chemicals ', ' ']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2010,277200,CA-18,-0.028988135489851602
"A New Paradigm for Integrated Analysis of Multiscale Genomic Imaging Datasets    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       A decade ago when microarray was first invented, it was hailed as ""an array of hope"" in Nature Genetics and has received a considerable amount of attention in biomedicine. Subsequently it has been called ""an array of problems"" in Nature Review. An inherent problem with microarray gene expression is that structural information is missing, which limits its ability in biological discovery. To overcome the poor reproducibility and accuracy of microarray imaging, there needs to be a shift in fundamental paradigms to those able to incorporate complementary and multiscale structural imaging information into microarray imaging. Fortunately, the latest progress in high resolution biomolecular imaging probe development coupled with advanced image analysis makes integrative and systematic studies of cellular systems possible. A cell can be labeled using multiscale and multimodality imaging, providing both structural and functional information. With multiscale imaging spreadsheets now available, there is an overwhelming need within the life sciences community to manage this information effectively, to analyze it comprehensively, and to apply the resulting knowledge in the understanding of the genetic system of a cell. However, the management and mining of this large-scale imaging information is limited by today's computational approaches and knowledge-sharing infrastructure. These problems represent a major impediment to progress in the emerging area of bio-molecular image informatics. Therefore, the goal of this project is to develop a unique genomic image management and mining system that can allow geneticists to search, correlate and integrate this multiscale and multi-modality imaging information in an easily operable fashion and further enable new biological discovery. In particular, this system will fill a void left in the current image database systems such as Open Microscope Environment (OME), e.g., the lack of analytic tools for integrative data analysis. To realize this goal, we are bringing together a strong interdisciplinary team consisting of imaging engineers, geneticists and industrial imaging scientists. Building on our diverse and complementary expertise, we are able to provide innovative and interdisciplinary approaches that combine the latest progress in image processing, imaging database design and machine learning with the development of high resolution and high throughput molecular imaging probes in genomics. More specifically, we will accomplish the following specific aims. First, we will develop a suite of algorithms for content extraction and information retrieval from high resolution fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) images. This visual system will effectively manage imaging phenotype information, facilitating knowledge discovery such as identifying visually similar subtypes. Second, we will correlate quantitative traits extracted from FISH imaging with genomic structural rearrangements and gene expression patterns. Finally, we will develop a data integration approach to fuse disparate information from multi-modality imaging databases for improved characterization of biological systems.               Public Health Relevance Statement The anticipated outcome of the project will include a publicly accessible imaging database analysis system to facilitate multiscale genomic image information integration and knowledge mining. The proposed approach challenges the current paradigm by the integration of high resolution structural imaging with functional information, which promises to overcome the poor accuracy and reproducibility problems plagued with microarray imaging.

"Multigenic Dissection of Nonsyndromic Oral Clefts    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed 5-year career development award will provide training and experience in bioinformatics and the administration of large-scale epidemiologic studies and will prepare the applicant for a leadership role in the field of complex diseases. One of the strengths of the proposed plan is the commitment of three mentors with diverse and unique areas of expertise. They will oversee a phased development program to provide new and enhanced multidisciplinary skills in study management, the statistical genetics of complex disease, bioinformatics and computational biology, and the ethical issues associated with public health genomics. It will provide the specific and varied skills required to succeed in a career devoted to responsibly-conducted epidemiologic studies that employ state-of-the-art molecular and computational methods to elucidate the mechanisms of complex human diseases. In her research, the applicant will use DNA from mothers and infants enrolled in a large-scale birth defects surveillance study to investigate the multigenic origins of nonsyndromic oral clefts (NOC) using a novel application of a proven analytical approach, Bayesian networks. In accomplishing the first aim, she will identify and validate the most probable network linking the phenotype of isolated NOC to the candidate maternal and subject single nucleotide polymorphisms and environmental exposures among the majority race/ethnicity. Through the second aim, she will validate two approaches to phenotying non-isolated NOC. Finally, she will determine whether the model(s) generated in Aims 1 and 2 can be generalized to minority race/ethnicity groups. This project will provide the framework upon which the investigator will prepare for an independent research career. Additionally, by being the first investigation to concurrently consider the candidate environmental exposures and SNPs in several candidate genes previously associated with NOC in association studies, this work has the potential to move the study of NOC dramatically forward. Relevance: Cleft lip and/or cleft palate are among the most common birth defects have serious physical, psychological, and financial consequences for those affected. Despite this, little is known about the causes of these anomalies because clefts are the result of genetic and environmental risk factors, rather than a single factor. The proposed research has the potential to make a unique contribution to our understanding clefts because it uses novel analytical approaches that allow the simultaneous examination of many potential risk factors.           ",Multigenic Dissection of Nonsyndromic Oral Clefts,7809627,K08DE016956,"['Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Dissection ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Defect ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Data ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' human disease ', ' surveillance study ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Molecular ', ' Affect ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Goals ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Link ', ' Infant ', ' Training ', ' Leadership ', ' Literature ', ' Genetic Heterogeneity ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Mentors ', ' Mothers ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Phenotype ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Program Development ', ' Cleaved cell ', ' cleaved ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Computational Biology ', ' Arts ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Investigation ', ' Work ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' meetings ', ' experience ', ' heuristics ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' Congenital Abnormality ', ' Molecular Genetic Abnormality ', ' Congenital Malformation ', ' Congenital Deformity ', ' Congenital Defects ', ' Congenital Anatomical Abnormality ', ' Congenital Anatomic Abnormality ', ' Birth Defects ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Cleft lip with or without cleft palate ', ' cl/p ', ' Ethical Issues ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Genomics ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Cleft Lip ', ' hare lip ', ' Harelip ', ' Cleft Palate ', ' oral cleft ', ' computer based statistical methods ', ' Bayesian Networks ', ' Minority ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' ']",NIDCR,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,K08,2010,129456,MA-07,-0.0035167200893306953
"Bioconductor: an open computing resource for genomics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Bioconductor project provides an open resource for the development and distribution of innovative reliable software for computational biology and bioinformatics. The range of available software is broad and rapidly growing as are both the user community and the developer community. The project maintains a web portal for delivering software and documentation to end users as well as an active mailing list. Additional services for developers include a software archive, mailing list and assistance and advice program development and design      We propose an active development strategy designed to meet new challenges while simultaneously providing user and developer support for existing tools and methods. In particular we emphasize a design strategy that accommodates the imperfect, yet evolving nature of biological knowledge and the relatively rapid development of new experimental technologies. Software solutions must be able to rapidly adapt and to facilitate new problems when they arise.      CRITQUE 1:      The Bioconductor project began in 2001. In 2002 it was awarded a BISTI grant for three years 2003-2006). During this time the project has expanded and provided support for a world wide community of researchers. This is a proposal for continued development for Bioconductor, which is a set of statistical programs which are specifically tailored to the computatational biology community. Bioconductor is composed of over 130 R packages that have been contributed by a large number of developers. The software packages range from state of the art statistical methods which typically are used in microarray analysis, to annotation tools, to plotting functions, GUIs, to sequence alignment and data management packages. Contributions to and usage of Bioconductor is growing rapidly and the applicants are requesting support to continue its development as well as general logistical support for software distribution and quality assurance. The proposal includes a research component for Bioconductor which will involve the development of analysis techniques. This will include optimization of the R statistical analyses, statistical processing of Affymetrix data, analysis of SNP data, improved standards, data storage, retreivals from NCBI, sequence management, machine learning, web services and distributed computing.      SCIENTIFIC MERIT   The applicants address many issues that are crucial to the success of a large open source project with multiple contributors. Examples of training, scientific publication, documentation and resource development run throughout the proposal. Many tangible examples were given on the usage of the system by the scientific community.        EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN   This is a description of their management workflow for the project which does a good job of demonstrating the technical excellence brought to the project by this group. 1) Build annotation packages every three months, Integrate changes in annotation source data structure into annotation package building code. 2) Maintain project website, mailing lists, source control archive. Organize web resources for short course and conferences. 3) Improve existing software. 4) Sustain automated nightly builds. Work with developers whose packages fail to pass QA. 5) Resolve cross-platform issues. 6) Review new submissions. Answer questions on the mailing lists. 7) Use software engineering best practices. Develop unit testing strategies. Design appropriate classes and methods for new data types. Refactor existing code for better interoperability and extensibility. 8) Develop and organize training materials and documentation.      Extensive detail on testing, build procedures, interoperability, quality assurance and project management is given elsewhere in the document. They clearly have dealt with many issues necessary for a project of this size. They state that one of the biggest cost items is support of this package to run on multiple platforms. They point out that many contributors focus on a single platform, much of their work is track down cross-platform bugs. This is time well-spent, given the platforms used are in sync with the needs of the greater bioinformatics community.        ORIGINALITY   While a high degree of originality is not a particularly critical element of open source software development project, there are certainly areas in the proposal that are unique. Most importantly, it is safe to say that there is not another project which has this blend of statistical analysis systems specifically tailored to a important research bioinformatics area that can be deployed on a number of different computer environments.      INVESTIGATOR AND CO-INVESTIGATORS   Dr. Gentleman is the founder and leader of the Bioconductor project. Dr. Gentlemen was an Associate Professor in the Department of Biostatistics, Harvard School of Public Health and Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute. In 2004 he became Program Head, Computational Biology, at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle. He has on the order of ten publications relating to Bioconductor or related statistical analysis. He implemented the original versions of the R programming language jointly with another co-founder. He is PI or Investigator of a number of research grants, at least two are directly related to this work. He and other members of the proposal have taught a number of courses and given lectures on Bioconductor, the amount of these courses certainly indicate significant dedication to the project.  A review of the PI and Co-PI activities related to this project are shown on Table 3 on page 42 of the application. The roles and time allocations assigned to each participant appear to be reasonable.  Dr. Gentleman will serve as project leader and will manage the programmers, coordinating the project, and investigating new computational methods and approaches.  Dr. Vincent Carey, as co Principal Investigator has 20% time allocated for the project.  In 2005 he became Associate Professor of Medicine (Biostatistics). Carey is a senior member of the Bioconductor development core. He will improve interoperability to allow Bioconductor reuse of external modules in Java, Perl and other languages as well as strengthen interfaces between high throughput experimental workflows and machine learning tools, and ontology capture.  An administrative assistant will assist Dr. Carey with administrative requirements, including call coordination, manuscript preparation and distribution, scheduling and budget management.  Dr. Rafael Irizarry as co-PI will spend 30% effort on the project.  Dr. Irizarry has four years experience developing methods for microarray data analysis and in the Department of Biostatistics serving as faculty liaison to the Johns Hopkins Medical Institution's Microarray Core.  He will supervize all efforts to support preprocessing on all platforms and support for microarray related consortiums such as the ERCC, GEO, and ArrayExpress.      Programmers will be responsible for the project website, managing email lists, maintaining training materials, upgrading software, refactoring and other code enhancements, managing the svn archive, and Bioconductor releases. They will handle checking all submitted packages, developing unit tests, and simplifying downloads, nightly build procedures, cross-platform issues, data technologies as well as integrating resources found in other languages (e.g. large C libraries of routines for string handling, machine learning and so on). Programmers have familiarity with R packages and systems for database management and for parallel and distributed computing. They will be responsible for managing the annotation data including package building and liaising with organism specific and other data providers.      SIGNIFICANCE   Given the scope of the proposal, and the size of the Bioconductor project in general the request for the above resources is appropriate. There is an excellent mix of grounded project management along with development of newer state of the art techniques that will benifit many members of the bioinformatics community. There is a high probability that funding this project will help to maintain and advance this important community resource.      ENVIRONMENT   The computer infrastructure, and the local departments of the PI and Co-PIs, as well as the work with the larger scientific community are all excellent environments to support this project.      IN SUMMARY   This is a terrific resource.  It is a well managed large open source project with very well crafted QA testing, documentation and training.  Continuation of this is a three year project. Beyond that period, a statement of long term stated goals is needed. The PI should articulate the strategic goals, as well as their research motivation and translate that into an action plan. They should also use that context to describe how they would go about choosing packages that are put into the Bioconductor system; Table 3 only listed the names of the packages made by the applicants, it could have gone further to give the reader more information for choosing packages.  A simple example would have been if they stated in the document: ""Given our assessment of the microarray state of the art, we ultimately aim to overlay annotation data, ontological information, and other forms of meta data onto a statistical framework for expression data."" The resulting research plan would then justify a five year project, but it was not strong enough in this application.       It should be noted that many of the benificiaries to this system are not just users that download the system.  In many cases a centralized informatics service downloads their system and then performs analysis for other members of the campus or the wider www community. While that type of ""success measure"" is hard to assess, more effort in this area in subsequent proposals would be helpful.           ",Bioconductor: an open computing resource for genomics,7910730,P41HG004059,[''],NHGRI,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,P41,2010,1093220,WA-07,-0.011103057503363125

"Analysis Tool for Heritable and Envirnonmental Network Associations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The efforts of the human genome project are beginning to provide important findings for human health. Technological advances in the laboratory, particularly in characterizing human genomic variation, have created new approaches for studying the human genome. However, current statistical and computational strategies are taking only partial advantage of this wealth of information. In the quest for disease susceptibility genes for common, complex disease, we are faced with many challenges. Selecting genetic, clinical, and environmental factors important for the trait of interest is increasingly more difficult as high throughput data generation technologies are developed. We know that genes do not act in isolation, thus numerous other factors are likely important in complex disease phenotypes. However, techniques for robust statistical modeling of important variables to predict clinical outcomes are limited in their capability for interaction effects. Ultimately, we want to know what factors are important to provide superior prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of human disease. Unfortunately, interpretation of statistical models in a meaningful way for biomedical research has been lacking due to the inherent difficulty in making such connections. Thus, a technology that embraces the complexity of human disease and integrates multiple data sources including biological knowledge from the public domain, through a powerful analytical framework is essential for dissecting the architecture of common diseases. ATHENA: the Analysis Tool for Heritable and Environmental Network Associations is a novel framework that incorporates variable selection, modeling, and interpretation to learn more about diseases of public health interest. As the field gains experience in analyzing large scale genomic data, it is crucial that we learn from each other and develop and codify the best strategies.            Many common, complex diseases are likely due to a combination of genetic and environmental risk factors.

"Methods for genomic data with graphical structures    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broad, long-term objective of this project concerns the development of novel statistical methods and computational tools for statistical and probabilistic modeling of genomic data motivated by important biological questions and experiments. The specific aim of the current project is to develop new statistical models and methods for analysis of genomic data with graphical structures, focusing on methods for analyzing genetic pathways and networks, including the development of nonparametric pathway-smooth tests for two-sample and analysis of variance problems for identifying pathways with perturbed activity between two or multiple experimental conditions, the development of group Lasso and group threshold gradient descent regularized estimation procedures for the pathway-smoothed generalized linear models, Cox proportional hazards models and the accelerated failure time models in order to identify pathways that are related to various clinical phenotypes. These methods hinge on novel integration of spectral graph theory, non-parametric methods for analysis of multivariate data and regularized estimation methods fro statistical learning. The new methods can be applied to different types of genomic data and will ideally facilitate the identification of genes and biological pathways underlying various complex human diseases and complex biological processes. The project will also investigate the robustness, power and efficiencies o these methods and compare them with existing methods. In addition, this project will develop practical a feasible computer programs in order to implement the proposed methods, to evaluate the performance o these methods through application to real data on microarray gene expression studies of human hear failure, cardiac allograft rejection and neuroblastoma.

"Computational Strategies for Quantitative Mapping of Genetic Interaction Networks    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent studies suggest that many diseases, particularly those that commonly afflict our population, result from interactions among multiple alleles. In an attempt to understand these complex phenotypes, recent experimental efforts in model organisms have focused on measuring such interactions by engineering combinatorial genetic perturbations. Due to the enormous space of possible mutants, brute-force experimental investigation is simply not feasible, and thus, there is a critical need for computational strategies for intelligent exploration of genetic interaction networks. The specific objective of this application is to develop a computational framework for leveraging the existing genomic or proteomic data to enable intelligent direction of combinatorial perturbation studies. The rationale for the proposed research is that although current knowledge of genetic interactions is sparse, the integration of existing genomic and proteomic data can enable the inference of network models that suggest promising candidates for high-throughput interaction screens. Using such computational guidance should enable more efficient characterization of network structure, and ultimately, better understanding of how genes contribute to complex phenotypes.  Based on strong findings in preliminary studies, this objective will be accomplished through two specific aims: (1) development of critical normalization methods and quantitative models for colony array-based interaction assays, and (2) novel machine learning-based approaches for iterative model refinement and optimal interaction screen selection.  The proposed research is innovative because it would represent one of the first efforts to couple genomic data integration and network inference technology with a large-scale experimental effort, where several months of experimental investigation are based entirely on computational direction. Such an approach will yield insight into how combinatorial perturbations can be used to characterize global modularity and organization, and more generally, would serve as a prototype for hybrid computational-experimental strategies in other genomic contexts.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many common diseases result from interactions among multiple genes. One approach to studying multigenic interactions is to introduce combinations of mutations in model organisms and observe how they affect the cell.

"Prediction of Protein Crystallization and Diffraction Quality    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Given the key role that crystallography plays in structural biology, protein crystallization remains a significant bottleneck affecting a broad range of research programs. We developing a data-mining framework, PROSPERO, that can predict crystallization success and crystal diffraction quality based on characterization of specific protein properties available prior to large-scale crystallization trials. This will increase the efficiency and overall success rates of diffraction studies by individual research programs as well as by genome-scale projects. PROSPERO will perform a meta-analysis of many individual predictors based on statistical and machine-learning methods. A key feature of this framework is that it can dynamically re-estimate success/failure rates based on the current contents of the underlying database, and on the set of physical characterization data provided by individual users. The design will be modular, in that we will define a standard set of application interfaces (APIs) for supplying new categories of data to the core data storage, meta-analysis and prediction components. This will allow use of PROSPERO to be tailored to individual research programs, to target-specific physical properties, and to incorporate new physical characterization techniques. Our long-term goal is to grow a user community that will benefit from the continually improving predictions made by a central PROSPERO web server, that will contribute new input modules based on data produced by standard laboratory protocols and apparatus, and will also contribute to the population of the underlying database of results used for prediction.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: X-ray crystallography is a core technique in fundamental research programs that seek to understand disease mechanisms based on the three-dimensional structure of individual proteins, of large multi-protein complexes, and of larger assemblies of proteins and nucleic acids into key components of the cell.

"Structure-Based Prediction of the Interactome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) play a central role in all biological processes. Akin to the complete sequencing of genomes, complete descriptions of interactomes is a fundamental step towards a deeper understanding of biological processes, and has a vast potential to impact systems biology, genomics, molecular biology and therapeutics. Although high-throughput biochemical approaches for discovering PPIs have proven very successful, the current experimental coverage of the interactome remains inadequate and would benefit from computational tools. The broad, long term goal of this proposal is to harness the information provided by structure-based computational approaches as a potentially high-quality, high-coverage data source for large-scale integrative approaches to interactome construction. Specifically, this project aims to: 1) develop new structure-based prediction methods that can be applied on a genome scale, and 2) integrate these predictions with other functional genomic information to predict PPIs at a genome scale. This project will also generate testable hypotheses for experimental investigations. A key product of the proposed research is the LTHREADER program, a localized threading program that will simultaneously align query sequence-pairs to templates of protein-protein interfaces. By exploiting information contained in the protein complex interfaces, it may significantly improve upon the state-of-the-art in coverage and prediction quality. Some of the core computational aspects are the development of algorithms for threading query sequence-pairs to templates (using linear programming), learning statistical potentials (SVMs), and combining multiple protein interface scores for PPI prediction (boosting). The output from such structure-based approaches will be combined with other functional genomic data in the Struct2Net framework for predicting PPIs (using random forests). A final product of the proposed research will be a comprehensive database of genome-wide PPI predictions derived from purely structure-based as well as integrative approaches. The database will also include extracellular ligand-receptor interactions.       The prediction of PPIs will enable better elucidation of extracellular and intracellular signaling networks, which has direct medical implications in terms of drug target identification. For example, a promising public-health application of this research is the rational design of therapeutics which inhibit or interfere with the binding of extracellular ligands to receptors. All the produced computational algorithms, software, and databases will be made publicly available for further studies.Relevance       Proteins interact with each other to communicate within and between cells, forming networks (the Interactome) that play fundamental roles in all biomedical processes including the maintenance of cellular integrity, metabolism, transcription/translation, and cell-cell communication. Understanding these interaction networks on a large scale will empower both rational, targeted drug design and more intelligent disease management. In this project, we develop computational methods for structure-based prediction of protein-protein interactions, and integrate these predictions with available high- throughput genomic data to predict the Interactomes of entire species' genomes.          ",Structure-Based Prediction of the Interactome,7797574,R01GM081871,"['Erbitux ', ' protein complex ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder

"National Center: Multiscale Analysis of Genomic and Cellular Networks (MAGNet) A network of molecular interactions, involving many thousands of genes, their products, and other molecules, underlie cellular processes. Investigation of these interactions across a wide range of scales ranging from the formation/activation of transcriptional complexes, to the availability of a signaling pathway, all the way to macroscopic processes, such as cell adhesion, calls for a new level of sophistication in the design of genome- wide computational approaches. A homogeneous environment for the comprehensive mapping and analysis of molecular cellular interactions in would be a powerful resource for the biomedical research community. We propose the creation of a National Center for the Multiscale Analysis of Genomic and Cellular Networks (MAGNet). The Center will provide an integrative computational framework to organize molecular interactions in the cell into manageable context-dependent components and will develop interoperable computational models and tools that can leverage such a map of cellular interactions to elucidate important biological processes. Center activities will involve a significant, multidisciplinary effort of biological and computational sciences. Specific areas of expertise include natural language parsing (NLP), machine learning (ML), software systems and engineering, databases, computational structural biology, reverse engineering of genetic networks, biomedical literature datamining, and biomedical ontologies, among others. The Center will 1) construct an evidence integration framework to collect and fuse a variety of diverse cellular interaction clues based on their statistical relevance 2) assemble a comprehensive set of physics- and knowledge-based methodologies to fill this framework 3) provide a set of methodologies and filters, anchored in formal domain ontologies, to associated specific interactions to an organism, tissue, molecular, and cellular context. All relevant tools will be made accessible to the biomedical research community through a common, extensible, and interoperable software platform, geWorkbench. We will reach out to train and encourage researchers to use and/or develop new modules for, geWorkbench. An important element of the software platform will be the development of specific components that can exploit the evidence integration techniques developed by Core 9001 investigators to combine molecular interaction clues from Core 9002 algorithms and databases. Development will be both driven and tested by the biomedical community to ensure the usefulness of the tools and the usability of the graphical user interfaces to address biomedical problems in completely novel ways, to dissect the web of cellular interactions responsible for cellular processes and functions.

"Computational Biology of Transcriptional Networks in Aging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Funding is sought for a five year mentored training period at Brown University for Dr. Nicola Neretti to transition from physics to independent investigator in computational biology. The candidate has a Physics PhD from Brown University, and has been working in the field of signal processing and machine learning. During the past year he has been part of a collaborative project with Dr. John Sedivy (Department of Molecular and Cell Biology and Biochemistry) which resulted in a published paper about the analysis of gene expression array data to target c-Myc-activated genes with a correlation-based method. He has established other productive collaborations with members of the Center for Computational Molecular Biology (CCMB) at Brown University. The principal mentor will be Dr. Marc Tatar (Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology). The secondary mentors will be Dr. Charles Lawrence (Dep. Applied Mathematics) and Dr. John  Sedivy. The work plan for the five years is to split the training/research effort evenly between computation and biology. For the training requirements the candidate plans to attend courses and workshops in genetics, biochemistry, molecular biology, bioinformatics, and related fields. Dr. Neretti also plans to complete lab rotations in the laboratory of Dr. Marc Tatar and Dr. John Sedivy, to acquire first hand experience in generating the biological data he will later analyze. The main focus of the research effort will be to use microarray data in time course experiments with a high temporal resolution to elucidate the complex interactions among genes and develop novel analytic techniques in functional genomic. In particular, the candidate proposes to integrate the results of gene clustering/graph analysis (e.g. correlation and tagged correlation based clustering) obtained from the time course data with the information available in genetic/pathway databases relevant to the process of senescence. This will allow the evaluation of given hypotheses about functional relationships among genes and the identification of novel dependencies, which can then be directly tested via experiments in model systems of aging. By using this approach the candidate proposes to address key questions in aging research such as what transcriptional changes are under the control of a nutrient sensing system, the temporal and hierarchical relationship of these changes, the magnitude of change that is biologically relevant, and whether genes within a functional metabolic network are co-regulated at the transcriptional level.                   ",Computational Biology of Transcriptional Networks in Aging,7895558,K25AG028753,"['Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Computational Molecular Biology ', ' Dependency (Psychology) ', ' emotional dependency ', ' Dependency ', ' detection of nutrient ', ' perception of nutrients ', ' nutrient sensing ', ' computerized data processing ', ' signal processing ', ' data processing ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Drosophila genus ', ' fruit fly ', ' Drosophila ', ' Homologous Gene ', ' Homologue ', ' Homolog ', ' GeneHomolog ', ' Ecology ', ' Environmental Science ', ' Address ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Data ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Molecular Analysis ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Research Training ', ' Resolution ', ' Funding Applicant ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Five-Year Plans ', ' Caenorhabditis elegans ', ' C.elegans ', ' C elegans ', ' fly ', ' Flies ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Affect ', ' Gene Cluster ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Aging ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' improved ', ' Hand ', ' Algorithms ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Insulin ', ' Regular Insulin ', ' Novolin R ', ' Insulin (ox), 8A-L-threonine-10A-L-isoleucine-30B-L-threonine- ', ' Humulin R ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Laboratories ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Databases ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Biochemical Pathway ', ' Metabolic Networks ', ' Mammals ', ' Mammalia ', ' Mathematics ', ' Mentors ', ' Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Methods ', ' Biological Models ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Molecular Biology ', ' DNA Molecular Biology ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Nematoda ', ' roundworm ', ' Nematodes ', ' Collaborations ', ' nutrition ', ' Nutritional Science ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Paper ', ' Metabolic ', ' Genetic ', ' Physics ', ' Play ', ' Publishing ', ' Insulin Receptor ', ' Insulin-Dependent Tyrosine Protein Kinase ', ' Insulin Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinase ', ' Reproduction ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Rotation ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Computational Biology ', ' Cellular biology ', ' cell biology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Universities ', ' dietary restriction ', ' restricted diet ', ' diet restriction ', ' Work ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Biochemistry ', ' Biological Chemistry ', ' Biology ', ' experience ', ' Gene Mutation ', ' Sequence Alteration ', ' Genetic mutation ', ' Gene Alteration ', ' DNA mutation ', ' DNA Alteration ', ' receptor ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' Response Elements ', ' Structure ', ' Nutrient ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Graph ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Cells ', ' c-myc Genes ', ' v-myc Avian Myelocytomatosis Viral Oncogene Cellular Homolog ', ' c myc ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' functional genomics ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' insulin signaling ', ' senescence ', ' senescent ', ' ']",NIA,BROWN UNIVERSITY,K25,2010,116662,RI-01,-0.011516466158544677
"Feedback Control of Biological Polymers in a Nanopore    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Electronic sequencing in nanopores shows great promise for inexpensive DNA sequencing at high speed and with minimal preparative steps. Such capability would lead to efficient reading of human SNPs or other genetic variations, which would in turn have a significant impact in pharmacogenomics and other disease treatments and preventions based on information from the patient's own genome. Recently, researchers identified the inability to regulate the speed of a molecule's translocation through the pore as the primary obstacle to realizing the sequencing potential of hemolysin nanopores.      The proposed research will investigate the application of feedback control to substantially improve the ability to regulate molecule translocation speeds in a nanopore, thereby improving the ability to sequence with existing nanopore technology. In particular, the primary goal is to design novel hardware and software algorithms for feedback control of single polymers in a hemolysin nanopore on a microsecond time scale and with near angstrom precision. Such capability would contribute to the development of nanopore-based sequencing technologies, augment the efforts of the $1000/mammalian genome project, and be a revolutionary contribution to the realm of applied feedback control. The control algorithms would also leverage the long-term objective of the proposed effort: the development of a nanopore-based single cell analyzer. The device would enable one to efficiently determine the concentration of all mRNA in a single cell at an instant of time. This technology would improve the ability to accurately track molecular events that occur during cell differentiation, by reducing the number of cells required for event detection and increasing the time resolution of detection measurements.        There are two primary aspects to the proposed research program that are necessary augmentations to my expertise in control. First, I will engage in a two-year intensive period of didactic training in relevant courses, including molecular and cellular biology, embryology, cell signaling, genomics and bioinformatics. The basic understanding gained is required for success in the application of control to problems in human health broadly, and in technology development for cell interrogation specifically. Second, I will participate in the $1000/mammalian genome project to learn about the physics and biology of the hemolysin nanopore. In parallel to the $1000 genome project, I will explore the controlled capabilities of the nanopore for efficient mRNA sequencing, using tools from bioinformatics and machine learning to translate the controlled response data into the identity of unknown nucleotides.          ",Feedback Control of Biological Polymers in a Nanopore,7910732,K25HG004035,"['Cytosine ', ' 2(1H)-Pyrimidinone, 4-amino- ', ' Pharmacogenomics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Electronics ', ' Embryology ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Molecular and Cellular Biology ', ' Resolution ', ' Other Genetics ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Feedback ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' Affect ', ' Genome ', ' base ', ' cell analyzer ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Hemolysin ', ' Hemalysins ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Algorithms ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Training ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Measurement ', ' Methods ', ' Nucleotides ', ' Patients ', ' Physics ', ' Poly C ', "" homopolymer 5'-Cytidylic acid "", ' Polycytidylic Acids ', ' Cytosine Polynucleotides ', ' Poly U ', "" homopolymer 5'-Uridylic acid "", ' Uracil Polynucleotides ', ' Polyuridylic Acids ', ' Poly(rU) ', ' Polymers ', ' tool ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' RNA ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Computer software ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Uracil ', ' 2-hydroxy-4-(3H)-pyrimidione ', ' 2,4-pyrimidinediol ', ' 2,4-dioxopyrimidine ', ' 4-hydroxy-2-(1H)-pyrimidione ', ' 2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione ', ' Vision ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Frequency ', ' Event ', ' Scanning ', ' Base Sequence ', ' nucleic acid sequence ', ' Nucleotide Sequence ', ' Biology ', ' copolymer ', ' Membrane ', ' membrane structure ', ' success ', ' voltage ', ' V (voltage) ', ' laptop ', ' technology development ', ' Speed (motion) ', ' Speed ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Cell Count ', ' Cell Number ', ' Cell Differentiation process ', ' Cell Differentiation ', ' Cells ', ' Measures ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' single molecule ', ' Genomics ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' nanopore ', ' nano pore ', ' mammalian genome ', ' ']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ,K25,2010,164921,CA-20,-0.009750472880129283
"Structure-Based Prediction of the Interactome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) play a central role in all biological processes. Akin to the complete sequencing of genomes, complete descriptions of interactomes is a fundamental step towards a deeper understanding of biological processes, and has a vast potential to impact systems biology, genomics, molecular biology and therapeutics. Although high-throughput biochemical approaches for discovering PPIs have proven very successful, the current experimental coverage of the interactome remains inadequate and would benefit from computational tools. The broad, long term goal of this proposal is to harness the information provided by structure-based computational approaches as a potentially high-quality, high-coverage data source for large-scale integrative approaches to interactome construction. Specifically, this project aims to: 1) develop new structure-based prediction methods that can be applied on a genome scale, and 2) integrate these predictions with other functional genomic information to predict PPIs at a genome scale. This project will also generate testable hypotheses for experimental investigations. A key product of the proposed research is the LTHREADER program, a localized threading program that will simultaneously align query sequence-pairs to templates of protein-protein interfaces. By exploiting information contained in the protein complex interfaces, it may significantly improve upon the state-of-the-art in coverage and prediction quality. Some of the core computational aspects are the development of algorithms for threading query sequence-pairs to templates (using linear programming), learning statistical potentials (SVMs), and combining multiple protein interface scores for PPI prediction (boosting). The output from such structure-based approaches will be combined with other functional genomic data in the Struct2Net framework for predicting PPIs (using random forests). A final product of the proposed research will be a comprehensive database of genome-wide PPI predictions derived from purely structure-based as well as integrative approaches. The database will also include extracellular ligand-receptor interactions.       The prediction of PPIs will enable better elucidation of extracellular and intracellular signaling networks, which has direct medical implications in terms of drug target identification. For example, a promising public-health application of this research is the rational design of therapeutics which inhibit or interfere with the binding of extracellular ligands to receptors. All the produced computational algorithms, software, and databases will be made publicly available for further studies.Relevance       Proteins interact with each other to communicate within and between cells, forming networks (the Interactome) that play fundamental roles in all biomedical processes including the maintenance of cellular integrity, metabolism, transcription/translation, and cell-cell communication. Understanding these interaction networks on a large scale will empower both rational, targeted drug design and more intelligent disease management. In this project, we develop computational methods for structure-based prediction of protein-protein interactions, and integrate these predictions with available high- throughput genomic data to predict the Interactomes of entire species' genomes.          ",Structure-Based Prediction of the Interactome,8054929,R01GM081871,"['Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism

"Computational Biology of Transcriptional Networks in Aging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Funding is sought for a five year mentored training period at Brown University for Dr. Nicola Neretti to transition from physics to independent investigator in computational biology. The candidate has a Physics PhD from Brown University, and has been working in the field of signal processing and machine learning. During the past year he has been part of a collaborative project with Dr. John Sedivy (Department of Molecular and Cell Biology and Biochemistry) which resulted in a published paper about the analysis of gene expression array data to target c-Myc-activated genes with a correlation-based method. He has established other productive collaborations with members of the Center for Computational Molecular Biology (CCMB) at Brown University. The principal mentor will be Dr. Marc Tatar (Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology). The secondary mentors will be Dr. Charles Lawrence (Dep. Applied Mathematics) and Dr. John  Sedivy. The work plan for the five years is to split the training/research effort evenly between computation and biology. For the training requirements the candidate plans to attend courses and workshops in genetics, biochemistry, molecular biology, bioinformatics, and related fields. Dr. Neretti also plans to complete lab rotations in the laboratory of Dr. Marc Tatar and Dr. John Sedivy, to acquire first hand experience in generating the biological data he will later analyze. The main focus of the research effort will be to use microarray data in time course experiments with a high temporal resolution to elucidate the complex interactions among genes and develop novel analytic techniques in functional genomic.

"Secure Sharing of Clinical History & Genetic Data: Empowering Predictive Pers. Me    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Computer-assisted medicine is at a crossroads: medical care requires accurate data, but making such data widely available can create unacceptable risks to the privacy of individual patients. This tension between utility and privacy is especially acute in predictive personalized medicine (PPM). PPM holds the promise of making treatment decisions tailored to the individual based on her or his particular genetics and clinical history. Making PPM a reality requires running statistical, data mining and machine learning algorithms on combined genetic, clinical and demographic data to construct predictive models. Access to such data directly competes with the need for healthcare providers to protect the privacy of each patient's data, thus creating a tradeoff between model efficacy and privacy. Thus we find ourselves in an unfortunate standoff: significant medical advances that would result from more powerful mining of the data by a wider variety of researchers are hindered by significant privacy concerns on behalf of the patients represented in the data set. In this proposed work, we seek to develop and evaluate technology to resolve this standoff, enabling health practitioners and researchers to compute on privacy-sensitive medical records in order to make treatment decisions or create accurate models, while protecting patient privacy. We will evaluate our approach on a de-identified actual electronic medical record, with an average of 29 years of clinical history on each patient, and with detailed genetic data (650K SNPs) available for a subset of 5000 of the patients. This data set is available to us now through the Wisconsin Genomics Initiative, but only on a computer at the Marshfield Clinic. If successful our approach will make possible the sharing of this cutting-edge data set, and others like it that are now in development, including our ability to analyze this data at UW-Madison where we have thousands of processors available in our Condor pool. Our privacy approach integrates secure data access environments, including those appropriate to the use of laptops and cloud computing, with novel anonymization algorithms providing differential privacy guarantees for data and/or published results of data analysis. To this end, our specific aims are as follows:       AIM 1: Develop and deploy a secure local environment that, in combination with secure network functionality, will ensure end-to-end security and privacy for electronic medical records and biomedical datasets shared between clinical institutions and researchers.       AIM 2: Develop and deploy a secure virtual environment to allow large-scale, privacy-preserving data analysis ""in the cloud.""       AIM 3: Develop and evaluate privacy-preserving data mining algorithms for use with original (not anonymized) data sets consisting of electronic medical records and genetic data.       AIM 4: Develop and evaluate anonymizing data publishing algorithms and privacy guarantees that are appropriate to the complex structure present in electronic medical records with genetic data.            Project Narrative This project will develop an integrated approach to secure sharing of clinical and genetic data that based on algorithms for anonymization of data to achieve differential privacy guarantees, for privacy-preserving publication of data analysis results, and secure environments for data sharing that include addressing the increasing use of laptops and of cloud computing. The end goal of this project is to meet the competing demands of providing patients with both privacy and accurate predictive models based on clinical history and genetics. This project includes the first concrete evaluation of privacy- preserving data mining algorithms on actual combined EMR and genetic data, using with the Wisconsin Genomics Initiative data set.",Secure Sharing of Clinical History & Genetic Data: Empowering Predictive Pers.

"Computational Strategies for Quantitative Mapping of Genetic Interaction Networks    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent studies suggest that many diseases, particularly those that commonly afflict our population, result from interactions among multiple alleles. In an attempt to understand these complex phenotypes, recent experimental efforts in model organisms have focused on measuring such interactions by engineering combinatorial genetic perturbations. Due to the enormous space of possible mutants, brute-force experimental investigation is simply not feasible, and thus, there is a critical need for computational strategies for intelligent exploration of genetic interaction networks. The specific objective of this application is to develop a computational framework for leveraging the existing genomic or proteomic data to enable intelligent direction of combinatorial perturbation studies. The rationale for the proposed research is that although current knowledge of genetic interactions is sparse, the integration of existing genomic and proteomic data can enable the inference of network models that suggest promising candidates for high-throughput interaction screens. Using such computational guidance should enable more efficient characterization of network structure, and ultimately, better understanding of how genes contribute to complex phenotypes.  Based on strong findings in preliminary studies, this objective will be accomplished through two specific aims: (1) development of critical normalization methods and quantitative models for colony array-based interaction assays, and (2) novel machine learning-based approaches for iterative model refinement and optimal interaction screen selection.  The proposed research is innovative because it would represent one of the first efforts to couple genomic data integration and network inference technology with a large-scale experimental effort, where several months of experimental investigation are based entirely on computational direction. Such an approach will yield insight into how combinatorial perturbations can be used to characterize global modularity and organization, and more generally, would serve as a prototype for hybrid computational-experimental strategies in other genomic contexts.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many common diseases result from interactions among multiple genes. One approach to studying multigenic interactions is to introduce combinations of mutations in model organisms and observe how they affect the cell. This project proposes to develop computational strategies to guide and interpret these combinatorial perturbation studies, which will ultimately help us better understand and treat multigenic diseases.           Project Narrative: Computational Strategies for Mapping Genetic Interaction Networks Many common diseases result from interactions among multiple genes.

"Integrating Microarray and Proteomic Data by Ontology-based Annotation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       With the completion of the Human Genome Project, there is a need to translate genome-era discoveries into clinical utility. One difficulty in making bench-to-bedside translations with gene-expression and proteomic data is our current inability to relate these findings with each other and with clinical measurements. A translational researcher studying a particular biological process using microarrays or proteomics will want to gather as many relevant publicly-available data sets as possible, to compare findings. Translational investigators wanting to relate clinical or chemical data with multiple genomic or proteomic measurements will want to find and join related data sets. Unfortunately, finding and joining relevant data sets is particularly challenging today, as the useful annotations of this data are still represented only by unstructured free-text, limiting its secondary use. A question we have sought to answer is whether prior investments in biomedical ontologies can provide leverage in determining the context of genomic data in an automated manner, thereby enabling integration of gene expression and proteomic data and the secondary use of genomic data in multiple fields of research beyond those for which the data sets were originally targeted. The three specific aims to address this question are to (1) develop tools that comprehensively map contextual annotations to the largest biomedical ontology, the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), built and supported by the National Library of Medicine, validate, and disseminate the mappings, (2) execute a four-pronged strategy to evaluate experiment-concept mappings, and (3) apply experiment-context mappings to find and integrate data within and across microarray and proteomics repositories. To keep these tools relevant to biomedical investigators, we have included three Driving Biological Projects (DBPs), in the domains of breast cancer, organ transplantation, and T-cell biology. To accomplish these DBPs, our tools and mappings will be used to find and join experimental data within and across microarray and proteomic repositories. Having DBPs to address will focus our development on a set of scalable tools that can access and analyze experimental data covering a large variety of diseases. Through our advisory committee of world-renowned NIH-funded investigators, we will ensure that our findings will have broad applicability and are useful to a wide variety of biomedical researchers.          ",Integrating Microarray and Proteomic Data by Ontology-based Annotation,8138486,R01LM009719,"['Unified Medical Language System ', ' UMLS ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' translational medicine ', ' bench to bedside ', ' bench to bed side ', ' bench bedside ', ' bench bed side ', ' genome-wide ', ' genomewide ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Task Forces ', ' Cellular biology ', ' cell biology ', ' Cells ', ' Molecular Biology ', ' DNA Molecular Biology ', ' Proteomics ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' International ', ' Genome ', ' base ', ' Measurement ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Process ', ' improved ', ' Chemicals ', ' Detection ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' Play ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Writing ', ' Research ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Translating ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Genomics ', ' Text ', ' Translations ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Databases ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Computer software ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Specificity ', ' Sampling ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Ensure ', ' repository ', ' Organ Transplantation ', ' organ xenograft ', ' organ graft ', ' organ allograft ', ' Transplantation Surgery ', ' Organ Transplants, Including Bone Marrow for DCT ', ' Organ Transplants ', ' Grafting Procedure ', ' Clinical, Transplantation, Organ ', ' Online Systems ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Head ', ' Manuals ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Improve Access ', ' Clinical ', ' Nature ', ' Gene Expression ', ' text searching ', ' text mining ', ' literature searching ', ' literature mining ', ' discovery mining ', ' Investments ', ' Biological ', ' Methods ', ' Time ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Funding ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' T-Lymphocyte ', ' thymus derived lymphocyte ', ' Thymus-Dependent Lymphocytes ', ' T-Cells ', ' tool ', ' Scientist ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Maps ', ' Phenotype ', ' National Library of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' United States National Library of Medicine ', ' National Medical Library ', ' National Library of Medicine ', ' biomedical ontology ', ' Human Genome Project ', ' Ontology ', ' biomedical informatics ', ' biomed informatics ', ' ']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2011,266112,CA-18,-0.028988135489851602
"Systems Biology of Plasmodium falciparum: Building and Exploring Network Models    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There is an urgent need for novel anti-malaria interventions, due to the growing resistance of Plasmodium parasites to available drugs. The long-term objective of our research is to identify potential drug or vaccine targets using an efficient and cost-effective data-mining approach. This proposed study is aimed at the identification of biological networks as the first step toward a systems-level understanding of parasite biology. Compared to functional genomics, which requires a priori information about the identity or function of targets, a systems-level understanding of parasite biology will allow us to identify targets based on their key roles in networks. Specific aim 1 focuses on the harvest of data relevant to three gene families: the proteases, transporters, and transcription factors that are essential components in cellular networks for parasite growth and infection. Our project will encompass genomic data, expression data, and data derived from other high throughput experiments and bioinformatic and statistical analyses. Specific aim 2 focuses on the integration and encapsulation of these data in the form of network models. The models will be inferred using probabilistic graphical methods drawn from the field of engineering. Specific aim 3 focuses on the exploration of these models, particularly in the light of data from wet lab gene mapping and drug resistance experiments. Our ""biological maps"" will enable the visualization of evolutionary forces driving changes in the parasite's phenotype and should allow us to identify network design weaknesses in the parasite--potential vulnerabilities that could result in new malarial control strategies.           ",Systems Biology of Plasmodium falciparum: Building and Exploring Network Models,8131721,SC1AI080579,"['Rupture ', ' functional genomics ', ' Open Reading Frames ', ' Protein Coding Region ', ' ORFs ', ' Malaria ', ' Plasmodium Infections ', ' Paludism ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' comparative genomics ', ' Digestion ', ' Phenotype ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Genomics ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' programs ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' Techniques ', ' Methods ', ' Elements ', ' Maps ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Gene Proteins ', ' Protein Gene Products ', ' Staging ', ' Discipline ', ' Pattern ', ' Prevalence ', ' novel ', ' response ', ' Data ', ' member ', ' experience ', ' pressure ', ' Area ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' prototype ', ' Proteomics ', ' Family ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' theories ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' base ', ' transcription factor ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Work ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' insight ', ' Property ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Mediating ', ' Proteins ', ' gene product ', ' Process ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' stem ', ' Immune ', ' Infection ', ' Research ', ' Plasmodium falciparum ', ' P.falciparum ', ' P. falciparum ', ' Location ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Engineering ', ' Testing ', ' Genes ', ' Biological ', ' Biology ', ' Modeling ', ' Complex ', ' Beryllium ', ' Be element ', ' Chromosome Mapping ', ' genetic mapping ', ' Total Human and Non-Human Gene Mapping ', ' Linkage Mapping ', ' Gene Mapping Genetics ', ' Gene Mapping ', ' Gene Localization ', ' quantum ', ' driving force ', ' Systems Biology ', ' data mining ', ' datamining ', ' Gene Family ', ' Plant Roots ', ' root ', ' Harvest ', ' Hemoglobin ', ' Parasites ', ' Electrical Engineering ', ' biological systems ', ' Drug resistance ', ' resistant to Drug ', ' resistance to Drug ', ' drug resistant ', ' Peptide Hydrolases ', ' Proteolytic Enzymes ', ' Proteinases ', ' Proteases ', ' Peptidases ', ' Esteroproteases ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Imagery ', ' Visualization ', ' Vaccines ', ' Cell Cycle Regulation ', ' Cell Cycle Control ', ' Specialist ', ' trafficking ', ' transcriptomics ', ' computerized data processing ', ' signal processing ', ' data processing ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Plasmodium ', ' Antimalarials ', ' Antimalarial Drugs ', ' Antimalarial Agents ', ' Anti-Malarials ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' data integration ', ' network models ', ' Transcription Factor 3 ', ' Transcription Factor E2-Alpha ', ' Kappa-E2-Binding Factor ', ' Immunoglobulin Transcription Factor 1 ', ' E2A Immunoglobulin Enhancer Binding Factor E47 ', ' E2A Immunoglobulin Enhancer Binding Factor E12 ', ' ']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS SAN ANTONIO,SC1,2011,238085,TX-20,-0.021747522930669737
"Integration and visualization of diverse biological data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Modern genome-scale experimental techniques enable for the first time in biological research the comprehensive monitoring of the entire molecular regulatory events leading to disease. Their integrative analyses hold the promise of generating specific, experimentally testable hypotheses, paving the way for a systems-level molecular view of complex disease. However, systems-level modeling of metazoan biology must address the challenges of: 1. biological complexity, including individual cell lineages and tissue types, 2. the increasingly large scale of data in higher organisms, and 3. the diversity of biomolecules and interaction mechanisms in the cell. The long-term goal of this research is to address these challenges through the development of bioinformatics frameworks for the study of gene function and regulation in complex biological systems thereby contributing to a greater understanding of human disease. In the initial funding period, we have developed accurate methods for integrating and visualizing diverse functional genomics data in S. cerevisiae and implemented them in interactive web-based systems for the biology community. Our methods have led to experimental discoveries of novel biology, are widely used by the yeast community, and are integrated with the SGD model organism database. We now propose to leverage our previous work to develop novel data integration and analysis methods and implement them in a public system for human data. In the proposed research period, we will create algorithms appropriate for integrating metazoan data in a tissue- and cell-lineage specific manner in health and disease. We will also develop novel hierarchical methods for predicting specific molecular interaction mechanisms and will extend our methods for integrating additional biomolecules. These methods will direct experiments focused on the glomerular kidney filter, a critical and complex component of the human vascular system whose dysfunction directly contributes to microvascular disease. Prediction of these cell-lineage specific functional networks will advance the understanding of the glomerulus function and its role in microvascular disease, leading to better clinical predictors, diagnoses, and treatments. From a technical perspective, application to glomerular biology will enable iterative improvement of the proposed methods based on experimental feedback. The end product of this research will be a general, robust, interactive, and automatically updated system for human data integration and analysis that will be freely available to the biomedical community. We will leverage parallel processing technologies (inspired by Google- type cloud computing solutions) to ensure interactive-analysis speed on the system. This system will allow biomedical researchers to synthesize, analyze, and visualize diverse data in human biology, enabling accurate predictions of biological networks and understanding their cell-lineage specificity and role in disease. Such integrative analyses will provide experimentally testable hypotheses, leading to a deeper understanding of complex disorders and paving the way to molecular-defined tissue targeted therapies and drug development.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our general system will enable integrative analysis of human functional genomics data in a cell-lineage and disease-focused manner, allowing biomedical researchers to identify potential clinical biomarkers and to formulate specific hypotheses elucidating the cause and development of a variety of complex disorders.

"Computer Studies of Protein Structure and Function    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goals of the proposed research include: a) The development of methods and associated computational tools that use three-dimensional structural information to predict protein function. b) The development of methods for the integration of structural information in the generation of networks of protein- protein interactions (interactomes). c) The application of structural information in the creation of an interactome of human and tumor B-cells and the use of this network in applications to B-cell Biology. These research goals are motivated by a number of factors. First, there is a general sense that structural information, as provided for example by the Protein Structure Initiative (PSI) is not fully exploited by the wider biological community. An interactive function prediction server is being developed with this issue in mind. Second, Structural Biology has not been fully integrated into Systems Biology approaches to predict protein networks and it would be extremely valuable to try to increase the integration of the two fields. Third, human B-cell phenomena are of great biological and medical interest and there is an exciting opportunity to incorporate structural information into this field in a novel way. A central element of the approach to be taken is the use of structural alignments to reveal novel functional relationships between proteins that have been classified as belonging to different protein ""folds"". Evidence is provided that there is a wealth of functional information in such remote relationships and computational tools to mine and visualize this information will be developed. The research design also includes the description of a novel approach to use structural alignments to identify potential protein-protein ligand, protein-protein and protein-DNA binding partners and to identify interfacial residues in the complexes they form. A novel scoring scheme for protein-protein interactions will be developed and a database of potential complexes, designed originally for human proteins, will be constructed. The database will also identify complexes that are unlikely to form. The information in this database will be incorporated into a Baysian inference scheme and used in the construction of a ""structure-enabled"" B-cell Interactome. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The relevance of the proposed research to public health lies in part in the insights, and accompanying methods, that will be provided about structure/function relationships in proteins.

"Integrated Public Use Microdata Series: North Atlantic Population Project    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Research teams in the United States, Britain, Canada, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden have worked in close coordination to create the North Atlantic Population Project (NAPP), a massive integrated cross-national microdatabase that provides a baseline for studies of demographic change and opens fresh paths for spatiotemporal data analysis. We now propose improvements that will multiply the power of the NAPP infrastructure. We have three major aims: (1) Triple the size of the database to approximately 365 million records, adding 40 new datasets for the period 1787 to 1930 from Albania, Britain, Canada, Denmark, Egypt, Iceland, Ireland, Germany, Norway, Mexico, Sweden, and the United States. (2) Leverage our innovative record-linkage technology to create linked national panels that will allow expanded longitudinal analyses. (3) Connect the past to the present by merging NAPP with the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS), simplifying analysis of long-run change and ensuring long-run preservation and maintenance of the database. The landscape of scientific research on the human population is shifting. It is no longer sufficient just to study the relationships among variables at a particular moment in time. Researchers around the world now recognize that to understand the large-scale processes that are transforming society, we must investigate long-term change. The goal of this project is to provide the infrastructure to make such analysis possible. NAPP will make a strategic contribution to demographic infrastructure by providing a baseline for the study of changes in the demography and health of European and North American populations. In each country, NAPP provides the earliest census microdata available. Models and descriptions based on historical experience underlie both theories of past change and projections into the future. The NAPP data provide a unique laboratory for the study of economic and demographic processes; this kind of empirical foundation is essential for testing social and economic theory. The proposed work will be carried out by a team of highly-skilled researchers with unparalleled expertise and experience in data integration and record linkage. Collaborators include leading researchers from the University of Minnesota and the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research, and local experts from each of the participating countries. Centralized support for international collaboration will leverage the investments of each country and allow us to create an extraordinary resource for comparative social and economic research.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The North Atlantic Population Project (NAPP) provides fundamental infrastructure for scientific research, education, and policy-making and will allow social scientists to make comparisons across Northern Europe, the Mediterranean, and North America during three centuries of transformative change. The proposed work is directly relevant to the central mission of the NIH as the steward of medical and behavioral research for the nation: the new data will advance fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of human population dynamics. NAPP will unlock access to some of the largest and longest-running cross-sectional and longitudinal data sources in the world, and stimulate health-related research on population growth and movement, fertility, mortality, nuptiality, and family change, as well as the economic and social correlates of demographic behavior.           The North Atlantic Population Project (NAPP) provides fundamental infrastructure for scientific research, education, and policy-making and will allow social scientists to make comparisons across Northern Europe, the Mediterranean, and North America during three centuries of transformative change.

"Pattern Discovery for comparative epigenomics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose a training program that will prepare an effective independent investigator in computational genomics. The candidate has a PhD in biology from the University of Cambridge and will extend his skills in both computational and wet-lab methods through a two-year program of organized mentorship and training, and a structured five-year research program.  This program will promote the command of machine learning as applied to functional genomics data. Dr. William Noble will mentor the candidate's scientific development. Dr. Noble is a recognized leader in computational biology and machine learning. He holds a dual appointment as Associate Professor in Genome Sciences and Com- puter Science and Engineering, and has trained numerous postdoctoral fellows and graduate students. Dr. Jeff Bilmes, Associate Professor of Electrical Engineering, will contribute to the mentoring effort, and a committee of experienced genome and computational biologists will advise on science and the candidate's career goals.  Research will focus on the analysis of multiple tracks of data from high-throughput sequencing assays, such as the ChIP-seq data produced by the ENCODE Project. These experiments allow us to obtain a more complete picture of the structure of human chromatin, revealing the behavior of transcription factors, the organization of epigenetic modifications, and the locations of accessible DNA across the entire genome at up to single-base resolution. A current challenge is to discover joint patterns across multiple tracks of these functional genomics results simultaneously. This project will (1) develop computational methods for identifying such patterns, providing new ways of finding both well-understood genomic features and novel functional elements, (2) apply those methods to characterize the similarities and differences among different biological samples, establishing a better understanding of chromatin, the bounds of its variation, and its role in human disease, and (3) validate computational findings with laboratory experiments. The project will use a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN), a type of probabilistic graphical model, to represent the statistical dependencies between observed data, such as sequencing tag density, on an inferred hidden state sequence.

"Molecular Genetic Investigation of Pediatric Myelodysplastic Syndrome     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pediatric Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) is a heterogeneous group of clonal stem cell disorders characterized by varying degrees of cytopenias, and ineffective and dysplastic hematopoiesis. MDS can be classified as primary de novo MDS with no apparent underlying cause and secondary MDS following congenital or acquired bone marrow failure (BMF) disorders or cytotoxic therapies. Little is known about initiating events leading to pediatric MDS. As a result, no targeted therapies exist and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation remains the only therapeutic option.  The heterogeneous clinical and laboratory presentation and limited availability of clinically well-annotated patient samples and in vivo models have posed significant obstacles to study the disease and to identify genetic alterations unique to pediatric MDS. Therefore pediatric MDS remains largely classified by morphologic and cytogenetic criteria that provide few clues as to the molecular basis. Over the last 18 months, we have developed the first nationwide comprehensive Pediatric MDS and BMF Disorder Patient Registry and Tissue Repository now involving 3 institutions and continuing to grow. The registry has collected samples from > 60 individual patients in addition to biological material from 3 unique kindreds with pediatric MDS. These samples form the basis for our first genomic sequencing analysis to gather preliminary data for future experiments and represent the power of this registry to elucidate pathogenic mutations associated with MDS.  Our unique team of investigators will exploit the registry and catalyze our efforts to determine the fundamental underpinnings of pediatric MDS. The team includes David Williams (clinical/translational hematology), Mark Fleming (pediatric hematopathology /hematological genetics), Benjamin Ebert (high throughput genomic technologies in adult MDS) and Kyriacos Markinanos (genetic linkage analysis). We will undertake preliminary studies to demonstrate feasibility, and generate genomic data that will provide the basis for future hypothesis-driven translational and clinical research studies on a national level.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The underlying genetics and pathophysiology of pediatric MDS is poorly understood. By exploiting several well-characterized families with inherited MDS, we will aim to identify the genetic basis for this disorder.

"Research Education in Statistical Genetics of Substance Abuse This application seeks support from the National Institute on Drug Abuse R25 mechanism for pre-doctoral and postdoctoral research positions at the Virginia Institute for Psychiatric and Behavioral Genetics (VIPBG) at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU). The overall goal of this research education program is to provide an environment that encourages the development and application of statistical genetics at the highest levels. To accomplish this goal, a research education program in statistical genetics will been developed to foster interdisciplinary research, a key tenet of the NIDA mission, and which we believe is essential to conducting research in this field. Two areas of research focus are identified: Advanced Genetic Epidemiology and Statistical Molecular Genetics. These areas are synergistic and address a diverse variety of statistical methods, both those in current use and those under development. The research education program consists of pre-doctoral and postdoctoral components. Pre-doctoral participants will pursue degrees in either Human and Molecular Genetics or Biostatistics. This component is designed to recruit, at the earliest time in their careers, potential future investigators to research in statistical genetics focused on substance use, abuse and dependence (SUAD). The aim is to create a cohort of PhD graduates who are have been extensively exposed to, and begun to publish research in, this area at the outset of their research training. The postdoctoral component recognizes that many promising young researchers have training in areas relevant to, but not focused on, the statistical genetics of substance use and abuse. This flexible 2-3 year postdoctoral training component will help guide young investigators to this field of study and will provide them with integrated and focused training that will enable them to pursue careers in statistical genetics of SUAD. Research education is intended for individuals with training in mathematics, statistics, biostatistics, genetics, psychology or pharmacology and to those who have completed their clinical requirements for the MD degree. The goal of the postdoctoral component is to educate independent investigators who will contribute to the efforts to identify and characterize the genetic and environmental determinants of SUAD; they are expected to do so at VCU and at other institutions nationwide. To accomplish the overall program goal we will: i) Offer and carefully monitor a multidisciplinary integrated research training program with a range of research opportunities; ii) Meet the needs for training in emerging research areas in SUAD; iii) Provide training to researchers from diverse academic and ethnic backgrounds and intensive mentoring; iv) Provide a specialized curriculum that will merge strengths in SUAD research at our institution; and v) Disseminate course materials, developed software, user guides and example scripts to the wider community by teaching workshops and establishing a website with web casts, pod casts and script libraries. This project seeks support from the NIDA R25 research education program in statistical genetics of substance abuse.

"A Cyber-Informatics Approach to Studying Migration and Environmental Cancer Risk     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The World-Wide Web (Web 1.0) and online social media (Web 2.0) have revolutionized the ways medical knowledge is disseminated and health information is exchanged and shared among patients, supporters, and health care providers. Online patient communities have been expanding at an impressive rate with millions of active participants from all age groups. Recent studies on researching and analyzing social media contents for health-related applications show that this uprising cyber-trend leads to valuable knowledge, traditionally acquired with scientific methods such as observational epidemiological studies. This new mode for information acquisition is particularly advantageous for studies requiring long period of data curation. We propose to leverage the power of online contents, including user-generated contents on social network sites, to tackle NCI¿s second provocative question on complex migration patterns and their effect on environmental cancer risk. We hypothesize that the rich amount of personal information shared openly among cancer patients and cancer-free people online can be effectively mined to generate new knowledge on the topic, which cannot be easily uncovered with conventional migrant studies in our modern economy with population mobility patterns far more complex and dynamic than those observed in the past. To achieve our goal, we will build upon our unique cyber-informatics experience at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) on ultra-scale searching, identifying, and understanding free-structured web content. Specifically, we will develop domain-specific informatics tools to automatically reconstruct people's spatiotemporal lifelines, link them to spatiotemporal environmental data available from online sources such as the Environmental Protection Agency, and mine them using machine learning methods to search for salient associations between changes of migration-influenced environmental exposure and cancer risk. These tools will be individually validated and the overall approach will be carefully tested to understand its capabilities, methodological challenges, and practical limitations (if any) for knowledge discovery and scientific explorations in environmental cancer epidemiology. This study has the potential to provide a powerful complementary approach to the standard paradigm of observational epidemiological research. It will offer a fully automated and cost-effective way to discover new trends and monitor evolving ones on the impact of modern population migration patterns and environmental cancer risk. Such information could help cancer epidemiologists and health policy makers generate and prioritize study hypotheses worth testing with carefully controlled and properly powered (but also long term and costly) epidemiological studies.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Web mining has emerged in different domains as a powerful approach to harvesting knowledge of unprecedented quantity, comprehensiveness, and diversity. In this study we propose to pursue web mining in the environmental cancer risk domain. We will develop dedicated cyber-informatics algorithms and tools to (i) automatically search disparate online sources for retrieving and integrating contents related to individuals¿ cancer history and spatiotemporal environmental exposure profiles, and to (ii) effectively synthesize this information to accelerate knowledge discovery on environmental cancer risk change due to an individual's migration activities.              Web mining has emerged in different domains as a powerful approach to harvesting knowledge of unprecedented quantity, comprehensiveness, and diversity.

"Next generation risk variant discovery in a highly penetrant OCD subtype    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed five-year K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award outlines a program of career development and research activities that will assist the principal investigator to transition to an independent research career and prepare her to tackle the challenges ahead in unraveling the genetic basis of complex psychiatric phenotypes. The innovative research plan details an approach to mapping risk for a strongly genetic subtype of obsessive compulsive (OCD) and comorbid tic disorders by generating and analyzing whole-exome sequence in select families to identify risk alleles. These efforts will be guided by pilot identity-by-descent, homozygosity, and copy number variant data in the comprehensively phenotyped OCD Collaborative Genetic Study (OCGS) multiplex family dataset. The OCD+tic phenotype is an ideal complex disorder for next generation genetic mapping. The clear phenotype, possibly reduced heterogeneity, and strong genetic effects make it an excellent candidate for the application of methodologies recently proven successful in Mendelian disorders. While the principle investigator has a strong background in child psychiatry and molecular genetics, the knowledge and skills required to master emerging genetic technologies such as next generation sequencing (NGS) are novel and complex. The short-term goals of this application are to gain proficiency in the methods that will drive the field over the coming decades, learn the statistical, computational, and informatics tools that will support this research, continue to develop skills in study design and interpretation, and refine and incorporate clinical and phenotyping skills. A program of coursework, supervision, and hands-on application of these approaches will equip the applicant in the long-term to integrate molecular, computational, and phenotypic data to make meaningful contributions to the field of psychiatric genetics.

"Statistical Modeling of Complex Traits in Genetic Reference Super-Populations     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Genetic crosses in model organisms play an essential role in understanding the heritable architecture of medically relevant phenotypes. Traditionally, such crosses have tended to be on a small scale with either limited power to detect genetic effects or limited resolution to localize causal variants. Recently, however, the emergence of larger-scale interdisciplinary research, cheaper genotyping and parallel advances in human genetics, have spurred the development of more sophisticated and powerful experimental designs. Genetic Resource Populations (GRPs) use economies of scale to provide cost-effective and replicable platforms for genetic studies. This project concerns the largest, most ambitious GRP in mouse genetics to date, the Collaborative Cross (CC), and a series of crosses and designs related to or derived from it: the Diversity Outbred (DO) cross, the CC Recombinant Inbred Cross (CC-RIX) and the diallel. Experiments on each separate cross provide distinct information about the heritable architecture of a target complex disease. In combination, this Genetic Reference Super-Population (GRSP) potentially provides an unparalleled basis for cross-study replication and integration in mouse genetics. This project aims to develop statistical methods that advance the current state of complex trait analysis of these populations separately, and, by exploiting the unique structure that connects them, proposes to develop a statistical framework that allows for their joint use.  Aim 1 develops a Bayesian probabilistic framework for haplotype-based analysis of quantitative trait loci (QTL). Aim 1a develops a statistical software module for flexible haplotype-based analysis, which can be ex- tended by the researcher to model a rich variety of designs and disease types. Aim 1b will adapt machine learning techniques to provide posterior inference of the allelic series of a QTL. Aim 1c will incorporate Bayesian modeling of polygenic effects.  Aim 2 and 3 concern joint analysis, building on the foundation set by Aim 1. Aim 2 develops methods to optimize experimental design of follow-up studies in one population given results from another. Aim 2a uses the diallel to inform design of CC/CC-RIX/DO experiments. Aim 2b uses partial data on CC/CC-RIX/DO to guide collection of additional data. Aim 3 explores models for jointly analyzing multiple populations in the GRSP, using complementary datasets to stabilize analysis at single QTL (Aim 3a) and across multiple QTL (Aim 3b).  These aims address specific and persistent challenges in the cost-effective design and efficient analysis of multiparent genetic data, in particular the CC, DO, CC-RIX and diallel. The project will generate tools useful for a wide range of model organism crosses and can be applied to the genetic study of any complex disease.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     The proposed research will lead to improvements in the analysis and design of genetic studies on animal models of human disease. Because the project focuses on statistical methodology applied to experimental mouse populations, the scientific output of the project is expected to be applicable to basic research focusing on any medical condition that can be studied in the mouse.                  The proposed research will lead to improvements in the analysis and design of genetic studies on animal models of human disease.

"Reactome: An Open Knowledgebase of Human Pathways     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We seek renewal of the core operating funding for the Reactome Knowledgebase of Human Biological Pathways and Processes. Reactome is a curated knowledgebase available online as an open access resource that can be freely used and redistributed by all members of the biological research community. It is used by geneticists, genomics researchers, clinical researchers and molecular biologists to interpret the results of high-throughput experimental studies, by bioinformaticians seeking to develop novel algorithms for mining knowledge from genomics studies, and by systems biologists building predictive models of normal and abnormal pathways.  Our curational system draws heavily on the expertise of independent investigators within the community who author precise machine-readable descriptions of human biological pathways under the guidance of a staff of dedicated curators. Each pathway is extensively checked and peer-reviewed prior to publication to ensure its factual accuracy and compliance with the data model. A system of evidence tracking ensures that all assertions are backed up by the primary literature, and that human molecular events inferred from orthologous ones in animal models have an auditable inference chain. Curated pathways described by Reactome currently cover roughly one quarter of the translated portion of the genome. We also offer a network of ""functional interactions"" (FIs) predicted by a conservative machine-learning approach, that covers an additional quarter of the translated genome, for a combined coverage of roughly 50% of the known genome.  Over the next five years, we seek to (1) increase the number of curated proteins and other functional entities to at least 10,500; (2) to supplement normal pathways with variant reactions for 1200 genes representing disease states; (3) increase the size of the Reactome Fl network to 15,000 molecules; and (4) enhance the web site and other resources to meet the needs of a growing and diverse user community.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: RELEVANCE (See instructions):  Reactome represents one of a very small number of fully open access curated pathway databases.

"Integrated Public Use Microdata Series: North Atlantic Population Project    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Research teams in the United States, Britain, Canada, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden have worked in close coordination to create the North Atlantic Population Project (NAPP), a massive integrated cross-national microdatabase that provides a baseline for studies of demographic change and opens fresh paths for spatiotemporal data analysis. We now propose improvements that will multiply the power of the NAPP infrastructure. We have three major aims: (1) Triple the size of the database to approximately 365 million records, adding 40 new datasets for the period 1787 to 1930 from Albania, Britain, Canada, Denmark, Egypt, Iceland, Ireland, Germany, Norway, Mexico, Sweden, and the United States. (2) Leverage our innovative record-linkage technology to create linked national panels that will allow expanded longitudinal analyses. (3) Connect the past to the present by merging NAPP with the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS), simplifying analysis of long-run change and ensuring long-run preservation and maintenance of the database. The landscape of scientific research on the human population is shifting. It is no longer sufficient just to study the relationships among variables at a particular moment in time. Researchers around the world now recognize that to understand the large-scale processes that are transforming society, we must investigate long-term change. The goal of this project is to provide the infrastructure to make such analysis possible. NAPP will make a strategic contribution to demographic infrastructure by providing a baseline for the study of changes in the demography and health of European and North American populations. In each country, NAPP provides the earliest census microdata available. Models and descriptions based on historical experience underlie both theories of past change and projections into the future. The NAPP data provide a unique laboratory for the study of economic and demographic processes; this kind of empirical foundation is essential for testing social and economic theory. The proposed work will be carried out by a team of highly-skilled researchers with unparalleled expertise and experience in data integration and record linkage. Collaborators include leading researchers from the University of Minnesota and the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research, and local experts from each of the participating countries. Centralized support for international collaboration will leverage the investments of each country and allow us to create an extraordinary resource for comparative social and economic research.        The North Atlantic Population Project (NAPP) provides fundamental infrastructure for scientific research, education, and policy-making and will allow social scientists to make comparisons across Northern Europe, the Mediterranean, and North America during three centuries of transformative change. The proposed work is directly relevant to the central mission of the NIH as the steward of medical and behavioral research for the nation: the new data will advance fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of human population dynamics. NAPP will unlock access to some of the largest and longest-running cross-sectional and longitudinal data sources in the world, and stimulate health-related research on population growth and movement, fertility, mortality, nuptiality, and family change, as well as the economic and social correlates of demographic behavior.

"Integration and visualization of diverse biological data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Modern genome-scale experimental techniques enable for the first time in biological research the comprehensive monitoring of the entire molecular regulatory events leading to disease. Their integrative analyses hold the promise of generating specific, experimentally testable hypotheses, paving the way for a systems-level molecular view of complex disease. However, systems-level modeling of metazoan biology must address the challenges of: 1. biological complexity, including individual cell lineages and tissue types, 2. the increasingly large scale of data in higher organisms, and 3. the diversity of biomolecules and interaction mechanisms in the cell. The long-term goal of this research is to address these challenges through the development of bioinformatics frameworks for the study of gene function and regulation in complex biological systems thereby contributing to a greater understanding of human disease. In the initial funding period, we have developed accurate methods for integrating and visualizing diverse functional genomics data in S. cerevisiae and implemented them in interactive web-based systems for the biology community. Our methods have led to experimental discoveries of novel biology, are widely used by the yeast community, and are integrated with the SGD model organism database. We now propose to leverage our previous work to develop novel data integration and analysis methods and implement them in a public system for human data. In the proposed research period, we will create algorithms appropriate for integrating metazoan data in a tissue- and cell-lineage specific manner in health and disease. We will also develop novel hierarchical methods for predicting specific molecular interaction mechanisms and will extend our methods for integrating additional biomolecules. These methods will direct experiments focused on the glomerular kidney filter, a critical and complex component of the human vascular system whose dysfunction directly contributes to microvascular disease. Prediction of these cell-lineage specific functional networks will advance the understanding of the glomerulus function and its role in microvascular disease, leading to better clinical predictors, diagnoses, and treatments. From a technical perspective, application to glomerular biology will enable iterative improvement of the proposed methods based on experimental feedback. The end product of this research will be a general, robust, interactive, and automatically updated system for human data integration and analysis that will be freely available to the biomedical community. We will leverage parallel processing technologies (inspired by Google- type cloud computing solutions) to ensure interactive-analysis speed on the system. This system will allow biomedical researchers to synthesize, analyze, and visualize diverse data in human biology, enabling accurate predictions of biological networks and understanding their cell-lineage specificity and role in disease. Such integrative analyses will provide experimentally testable hypotheses, leading to a deeper understanding of complex disorders and paving the way to molecular-defined tissue targeted therapies and drug development.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our general system will enable integrative analysis of human functional genomics data in a cell-lineage and disease-focused manner, allowing biomedical researchers to identify potential clinical biomarkers and to formulate specific hypotheses elucidating the cause and development of a variety of complex disorders.

"Bioinformatics Strategies for Multidimensional Brain Imaging Genetics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Today's generation of multi-modal imaging systems produces massive high dimensional data sets, which when coupled with high throughput genotyping data such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), provide exciting opportunities to enhance our understanding of phenotypic characteristics and the genetic architecture of human diseases. However, the unprecedented scale and complexity of these data sets have presented critical computational bottlenecks requiring new concepts and enabling tools. To address these challenges, using the study of Alzheimer's disease (AD) as a test bed, this project will develop and validate novel bioinformatics strategies for multidimensional brain imaging genetics. Aim 1 is to develop a novel bi- multivariate analysis strategy, S3K-CCA, for studying imaging genetic associations. Existing imaging genetics methods are typically designed to discover single-SNP-single-QT, single-SNP-multi-QT or multi-SNP-single- QT associations, and have limited power in revealing complex relationships between interlinked genetic markers and correlated brain phenotypes. To overcome this limitation, S3K-CCA is designed to be a sparse bi- multivariate learning model that simultaneously uses multiple response variables with multiple predictors for analyzing large-scale multi-modal neurogenomic data. Aim 2 is to develop HD-BIG, a visualization and systems biology framework for integrative analysis of High-Dimensional Brain Imaging Genetics data. Machine learning strategies to seamlessly incorporate valuable domain knowledge to produce biologically meaningful results is still an under-explored area in imaging genetics. In this aim, we will develop a user-friendly heat map interface to visualize high-dimensional results, adjust learning parameters and strategies, interact with existing bioinformatics resources and tools, and facilitate visual exploratory and systems biology analysis. A novel imaging genetic enrichment analysis (IGEA) method will be developed to identify relevant genetic pathways and associated brain circuits, and to reveal complex relationships among them. Aim 3 is to evaluate the proposed S3K-CCA and IGEA methods and the HD-BIG framework using both simulated and real imaging genetics data. This project is expected to produce novel bioinformatics algorithms and tools for comprehensive joint analysis of large scale heterogeneous imaging genetics data. The availability of these powerful methods is critical to the success of many imaging genetics initiatives. In addition, they can also help enable new computational applications in other areas of biomedical research where systematic and integrative analysis of large-scale multi-modal data is critical. Using AD as an exemplar, the proposed methods will demonstrate the potential for enhancing mechanistic understanding of complex disorders, which can benefit public health outcomes by facilitating diagnostic and therapeutic progress.              Public Health Relevance (Narrative) Recent advances in multi-modal imaging and high throughput genotyping techniques provide exciting opportunities to enhance our understanding of phenotypic characteristics and underlying genetic mechanisms associated with human diseases. This proposal seeks to develop new bi-multivariate machine learning models and novel enrichment analysis methods, coupled with a visualization and systems biology framework, for integrative analysis of high-dimensional brain imaging genetics data.

"Secure Sharing of Clinical History & Genetic Data: Empowering Predictive Pers. Me    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Computer-assisted medicine is at a crossroads: medical care requires accurate data, but making such data widely available can create unacceptable risks to the privacy of individual patients. This tension between utility and privacy is especially acute in predictive personalized medicine (PPM). PPM holds the promise of making treatment decisions tailored to the individual based on her or his particular genetics and clinical history. Making PPM a reality requires running statistical, data mining and machine learning algorithms on combined genetic, clinical and demographic data to construct predictive models. Access to such data directly competes with the need for healthcare providers to protect the privacy of each patient's data, thus creating a tradeoff between model efficacy and privacy. Thus we find ourselves in an unfortunate standoff: significant medical advances that would result from more powerful mining of the data by a wider variety of researchers are hindered by significant privacy concerns on behalf of the patients represented in the data set. In this proposed work, we seek to develop and evaluate technology to resolve this standoff, enabling health practitioners and researchers to compute on privacy-sensitive medical records in order to make treatment decisions or create accurate models, while protecting patient privacy. We will evaluate our approach on a de-identified actual electronic medical record, with an average of 29 years of clinical history on each patient, and with detailed genetic data (650K SNPs) available for a subset of 5000 of the patients. This data set is available to us now through the Wisconsin Genomics Initiative, but only on a computer at the Marshfield Clinic. If successful our approach will make possible the sharing of this cutting-edge data set, and others like it that are now in development, including our ability to analyze this data at UW-Madison where we have thousands of processors available in our Condor pool. Our privacy approach integrates secure data access environments, including those appropriate to the use of laptops and cloud computing, with novel anonymization algorithms providing differential privacy guarantees for data and/or published results of data analysis. To this end, our specific aims are as follows:       AIM 1: Develop and deploy a secure local environment that, in combination with secure network functionality, will ensure end-to-end security and privacy for electronic medical records and biomedical datasets shared between clinical institutions and researchers.       AIM 2: Develop and deploy a secure virtual environment to allow large-scale, privacy-preserving data analysis ""in the cloud.""       AIM 3: Develop and evaluate privacy-preserving data mining algorithms for use with original (not anonymized) data sets consisting of electronic medical records and genetic data.       AIM 4: Develop and evaluate anonymizing data publishing algorithms and privacy guarantees that are appropriate to the complex structure present in electronic medical records with genetic data.            Project Narrative This project will develop an integrated approach to secure sharing of clinical and genetic data that based on algorithms for anonymization of data to achieve differential privacy guarantees, for privacy-preserving publication of data analysis results, and secure environments for data sharing that include addressing the increasing use of laptops and of cloud computing. The end goal of this project is to meet the competing demands of providing patients with both privacy and accurate predictive models based on clinical history and genetics. This project includes the first concrete evaluation of privacy- preserving data mining algorithms on actual combined EMR and genetic data, using with the Wisconsin Genomics Initiative data set.",Secure Sharing of Clinical History & Genetic Data: Empowering Predictive Pers.

"Computational Strategies for Quantitative Mapping of Genetic Interaction Networks    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent studies suggest that many diseases, particularly those that commonly afflict our population, result from interactions among multiple alleles. In an attempt to understand these complex phenotypes, recent experimental efforts in model organisms have focused on measuring such interactions by engineering combinatorial genetic perturbations. Due to the enormous space of possible mutants, brute-force experimental investigation is simply not feasible, and thus, there is a critical need for computational strategies for intelligent exploration of genetic interaction networks. The specific objective of this application is to develop a computational framework for leveraging the existing genomic or proteomic data to enable intelligent direction of combinatorial perturbation studies. The rationale for the proposed research is that although current knowledge of genetic interactions is sparse, the integration of existing genomic and proteomic data can enable the inference of network models that suggest promising candidates for high-throughput interaction screens. Using such computational guidance should enable more efficient characterization of network structure, and ultimately, better understanding of how genes contribute to complex phenotypes.  Based on strong findings in preliminary studies, this objective will be accomplished through two specific aims: (1) development of critical normalization methods and quantitative models for colony array-based interaction assays, and (2) novel machine learning-based approaches for iterative model refinement and optimal interaction screen selection.  The proposed research is innovative because it would represent one of the first efforts to couple genomic data integration and network inference technology with a large-scale experimental effort, where several months of experimental investigation are based entirely on computational direction. Such an approach will yield insight into how combinatorial perturbations can be used to characterize global modularity and organization, and more generally, would serve as a prototype for hybrid computational-experimental strategies in other genomic contexts.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many common diseases result from interactions among multiple genes. One approach to studying multigenic interactions is to introduce combinations of mutations in model organisms and observe how they affect the cell. This project proposes to develop computational strategies to guide and interpret these combinatorial perturbation studies, which will ultimately help us better understand and treat multigenic diseases.

"Computer Studies of Protein Structure and Function    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goals of the proposed research include: a) The development of methods and associated computational tools that use three-dimensional structural information to predict protein function. b) The development of methods for the integration of structural information in the generation of networks of protein- protein interactions (interactomes). c) The application of structural information in the creation of an interactome of human and tumor B-cells and the use of this network in applications to B-cell Biology. These research goals are motivated by a number of factors. First, there is a general sense that structural information, as provided for example by the Protein Structure Initiative (PSI) is not fully exploited by the wider biological community. An interactive function prediction server is being developed with this issue in mind. Second, Structural Biology has not been fully integrated into Systems Biology approaches to predict protein networks and it would be extremely valuable to try to increase the integration of the two fields. Third, human B-cell phenomena are of great biological and medical interest and there is an exciting opportunity to incorporate structural information into this field in a novel way. A central element of the approach to be taken is the use of structural alignments to reveal novel functional relationships between proteins that have been classified as belonging to different protein ""folds"". Evidence is provided that there is a wealth of functional information in such remote relationships and computational tools to mine and visualize this information will be developed. The research design also includes the description of a novel approach to use structural alignments to identify potential protein-protein ligand, protein-protein and protein-DNA binding partners and to identify interfacial residues in the complexes they form. A novel scoring scheme for protein-protein interactions will be developed and a database of potential complexes, designed originally for human proteins, will be constructed. The database will also identify complexes that are unlikely to form. The information in this database will be incorporated into a Baysian inference scheme and used in the construction of a ""structure-enabled"" B-cell Interactome.

"Center for Environmental Genetics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)        It is a priority of the CEG and the Career Development Program to identify and develop the careers of promising early stage investigators. To accomplish this goal, the overall objective of the career development program (CDP) is to recruit, enrich, encourage, and provide resources and mentoring activities to investigators at the graduate, postgraduate and early faculty levels with a particular emphasis on environmental health science. The CDP has forged new cross-disciplinary partnerships in areas applicable to environmental health science with basic, epidemiological, and/or clinical studies including studies in molecular genetics and environmental epidemiology and environmental toxicology.  To accomplish the overall objective, the CDP has developed a highly innovative approach with three specific.  Aim 1 is to attract, recruit and promote opportunities for junior faculty (within three years from initial appointment) towards development of an independent career interfacing between basic, translational or clinical investigations with application to environmental health science. The Next Generation Biomedical Investigator (NGBI) program is the principal mechanism for achieving this aim.  Aim 2 is to identify investigators with less experience (novice investigators) who are still in trainin with minimal experience but have an interest in examining the intricate role of environmental health science in health and disease. Recruits include physicians in their academic fellowship i.e. post residency, who are obtaining an MS or Ph.D, mentored postdoctoral Ph.D. fellows or advanced (third or fourth year) pre-doctoral research students. This aim is achieved by supplementing novice investigators' training with research resources, mentoring and career development opportunities through the New Investigator Scholar (NIS) pathway.  Aim 3 is to enrich training/scientific experiences, promote career opportunities and networking experiences, activities integrated with the Administrative and other CEG cores. The objective is to develop NGBIs and NISs and others new to environmental health science by enriching experiences as an investigator and eventually independent scientist. Thus, these aims are achieved through financial awards, mentorship, access to core resources and other career development activities.

"SPORE in Skin Cancer The incidence of melanoma has risen dramatically in recent years, but no therapy has improved overall survival for the majority of patients with unresectable metastatic disease. The University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute (UPCI) Melanoma and Skin Cancer Program (MSCP) will continue to conduct a Specialized Program of Research Excellence (SPORE) to improve our understanding of molecular and immunologic mechanisms of cancer progression and to validate prognostic and predictive biomarkers for personalized treatment of advanced melanoma and cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL). Of our 4 Projects, 1 is continued from the prior funding period, and 3 new projects have been derived from developmental research conducted in the last period; 1 of the prior SPORE projects will be continued with independent ROI funding. Our highly integrated approach leverages complementary expertise in melanoma, oncology, dermatology, immunology, biostatistics, bioinformatics, machine learning, genomics, proteomics, and biomarker discovery to test hypotheses central to the improvement of therapeutic outcome in skin cancers. Regardless of clinical outcomes, these Projects will also generate urgently needed mechanistic data to inform development of new therapeutic strategies and pathways through which to monitor relapse and progression. Our 4 Projects will evaluate: (1) the prognostic and predictive value of the pro-inflammatory response and markers of immune suppression in relation to ipilimumab and interferon (IFN)¿ adjuvant therapy (leveraging an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group-led adjuvant trial); (2) an engineered, 3-antigen dendritic cell vaccine and IFN¿ boost in patients with metastatic melanoma; (3) the safety and efficacy of vemurafenib modulation of immunotherapy with IFN¿2b in patients with metastatic melanoma; and (4) an entirely new personalized microneedle vaccination technology in patients with melanoma and CTCL. The Administrative Core (A) coordinates the clinical research and provides scientific and fiscal oversight of the entire SPORE. The Biospecimen Core (B) is housed in the UPCI Immunologic Monitoring and Cellular Products Laboratory, where all tissue banking, biospecimen processing, and immune assays are conducted. The Biostatistics Core (C) and Informatics Core (D) support all projects with data analysis and management, respectively. We will continue to solicit, review, and fund applications for the career development and developmental research programs, which in the prior funding period led to the design of a new full project in this application (Project 3)  and the promotion of career development recipients to co-investigators and a project leader. The goal of this application is to use a multi-disciplinary approach to improve outcomes in skin cancer and in particular, metastatic melanoma, a disease with a 15% 5-year survival rate. We will improve treatment and outcomes for skin cancer patients by identifying new ways to treat the disease based on the biology of the individual patient's tumor and new biomarkers that predict risk and response to therapy to prevent recurrence based on an individual patient's genetics and the tumor impact upon the microenvironment.",SPORE in Skin Cancer,8548580,P50CA121973,"['Lymphoblastoid

"Integration and visualization of diverse biological data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Modern genome-scale experimental techniques enable for the first time in biological research the comprehensive monitoring of the entire molecular regulatory events leading to disease. Their integrative analyses hold the promise of generating specific, experimentally testable hypotheses, paving the way for a systems-level molecular view of complex disease. However, systems-level modeling of metazoan biology must address the challenges of: 1. biological complexity, including individual cell lineages and tissue types, 2. the increasingly large scale of data in higher organisms, and 3. the diversity of biomolecules and interaction mechanisms in the cell. The long-term goal of this research is to address these challenges through the development of bioinformatics frameworks for the study of gene function and regulation in complex biological systems thereby contributing to a greater understanding of human disease. In the initial funding period, we have developed accurate methods for integrating and visualizing diverse functional genomics data in S. cerevisiae and implemented them in interactive web-based systems for the biology community. Our methods have led to experimental discoveries of novel biology, are widely used by the yeast community, and are integrated with the SGD model organism database. We now propose to leverage our previous work to develop novel data integration and analysis methods and implement them in a public system for human data. In the proposed research period, we will create algorithms appropriate for integrating metazoan data in a tissue- and cell-lineage specific manner in health and disease. We will also develop novel hierarchical methods for predicting specific molecular interaction mechanisms and will extend our methods for integrating additional biomolecules. These methods will direct experiments focused on the glomerular kidney filter, a critical and complex component of the human vascular system whose dysfunction directly contributes to microvascular disease. Prediction of these cell-lineage specific functional networks will advance the understanding of the glomerulus function and its role in microvascular disease, leading to better clinical predictors, diagnoses, and treatments. From a technical perspective, application to glomerular biology will enable iterative improvement of the proposed methods based on experimental feedback. The end product of this research will be a general, robust, interactive, and automatically updated system for human data integration and analysis that will be freely available to the biomedical community. We will leverage parallel processing technologies (inspired by Google- type cloud computing solutions) to ensure interactive-analysis speed on the system. This system will allow biomedical researchers to synthesize, analyze, and visualize diverse data in human biology, enabling accurate predictions of biological networks and understanding their cell-lineage specificity and role in disease. Such integrative analyses will provide experimentally testable hypotheses, leading to a deeper understanding of complex disorders and paving the way to molecular-defined tissue targeted therapies and drug development.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our general system will enable integrative analysis of human functional genomics data in a cell-lineage and disease-focused manner, allowing biomedical researchers to identify potential clinical biomarkers and to formulate specific hypotheses elucidating the cause and development of a variety of complex disorders. Our application of this system to generate cell-lineage specific functional networks will lead to a better understanding of the glomerulus function and will directly benefit human health through the development of improved predictors, diagnoses, and treatments for microvascular disease.

"Secure Sharing of Clinical History & Genetic Data: Empowering Predictive Pers. Me    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Computer-assisted medicine is at a crossroads: medical care requires accurate data, but making such data widely available can create unacceptable risks to the privacy of individual patients. This tension between utility and privacy is especially acute in predictive personalized medicine (PPM). PPM holds the promise of making treatment decisions tailored to the individual based on her or his particular genetics and clinical history. Making PPM a reality requires running statistical, data mining and machine learning algorithms on combined genetic, clinical and demographic data to construct predictive models. Access to such data directly competes with the need for healthcare providers to protect the privacy of each patient's data, thus creating a tradeoff between model efficacy and privacy. Thus we find ourselves in an unfortunate standoff: significant medical advances that would result from more powerful mining of the data by a wider variety of researchers are hindered by significant privacy concerns on behalf of the patients represented in the data set. In this proposed work, we seek to develop and evaluate technology to resolve this standoff, enabling health practitioners and researchers to compute on privacy-sensitive medical records in order to make treatment decisions or create accurate models, while protecting patient privacy. We will evaluate our approach on a de-identified actual electronic medical record, with an average of 29 years of clinical history on each patient, and with detailed genetic data (650K SNPs) available for a subset of 5000 of the patients. This data set is available to us now through the Wisconsin Genomics Initiative, but only on a computer at the Marshfield Clinic. If successful our approach will make possible the sharing of this cutting-edge data set, and others like it that are now in development, including our ability to analyze this data at UW-Madison where we have thousands of processors available in our Condor pool. Our privacy approach integrates secure data access environments, including those appropriate to the use of laptops and cloud computing, with novel anonymization algorithms providing differential privacy guarantees for data and/or published results of data analysis. To this end, our specific aims are as follows:       AIM 1: Develop and deploy a secure local environment that, in combination with secure network functionality, will ensure end-to-end security and privacy for electronic medical records and biomedical datasets shared between clinical institutions and researchers.       AIM 2: Develop and deploy a secure virtual environment to allow large-scale, privacy-preserving data analysis ""in the cloud.""       AIM 3: Develop and evaluate privacy-preserving data mining algorithms for use with original (not anonymized) data sets consisting of electronic medical records and genetic data.       AIM 4: Develop and evaluate anonymizing data publishing algorithms and privacy guarantees that are appropriate to the complex structure present in electronic medical records with genetic data.            Project Narrative This project will develop an integrated approach to secure sharing of clinical and genetic data that based on algorithms for anonymization of data to achieve differential privacy guarantees, for privacy-preserving publication of data analysis results, and secure environments for data sharing that include addressing the increasing use of laptops and of cloud computing. The end goal of this project is to meet the competing demands of providing patients with both privacy and accurate predictive models based on clinical history and genetics. This project includes the first concrete evaluation of privacy- preserving data mining algorithms on actual combined EMR and genetic data, using with the Wisconsin Genomics Initiative data set.",Secure Sharing of Clinical History & Genetic Data: Empowering Predictive Pers.

"Reactome: An Open Knowledgebase of Human Pathways     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We seek renewal of the core operating funding for the Reactome Knowledgebase of Human Biological Pathways and Processes. Reactome is a curated knowledgebase available online as an open access resource that can be freely used and redistributed by all members of the biological research community. It is used by geneticists, genomics researchers, clinical researchers and molecular biologists to interpret the results of high-throughput experimental studies, by bioinformaticians seeking to develop novel algorithms for mining knowledge from genomics studies, and by systems biologists building predictive models of normal and abnormal pathways.  Our curational system draws heavily on the expertise of independent investigators within the community who author precise machine-readable descriptions of human biological pathways under the guidance of a staff of dedicated curators. Each pathway is extensively checked and peer-reviewed prior to publication to ensure its factual accuracy and compliance with the data model. A system of evidence tracking ensures that all assertions are backed up by the primary literature, and that human molecular events inferred from orthologous ones in animal models have an auditable inference chain. Curated pathways described by Reactome currently cover roughly one quarter of the translated portion of the genome. We also offer a network of ""functional interactions"" (FIs) predicted by a conservative machine-learning approach, that covers an additional quarter of the translated genome, for a combined coverage of roughly 50% of the known genome.  Over the next five years, we seek to (1) increase the number of curated proteins and other functional entities to at least 10,500; (2) to supplement normal pathways with variant reactions for 1200 genes representing disease states; (3) increase the size of the Reactome Fl network to 15,000 molecules; and (4) enhance the web site and other resources to meet the needs of a growing and diverse user community.          RELEVANCE (See instructions):  Reactome represents one of a very small number of fully open access curated pathway databases. Its contents have contributed both directly and indirectly to large numbers of basic and translational research studies, and it supports a broad, diverse and engaged user community.

"Multiscale Framework for Molecular Heterogeneity Analysis     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genomic profiling has become a routine practice in selecting treatments for many diseases, enabling the classification of patients into categories that associate with improved outcomes for specific treatments. One potential detractor to this approach is the tremendous heterogeneity in tissues used for profiling. Genomic classifications, obtained from a relatively small biopsy, are subject to influence from broad, regional variations in the affected tissue. Heterogeneity on a cellular scale can also obscure the target of treatment, as cells with distinct molecular profiles are homogenized in genomic profiling. Realizing better therapies will depend greatly on the ability to understand molecular heterogeneity within an individual, a challenge that necessitates new approaches to organize, analyze and integrate data from multiple spatial and molecular scales. This proposal describes an informatics framework to characterizing heterogeneity for tissue based studies. The framework will combine imaging informatics with genomics to describe molecular heterogeneity at multiple spatial and molecular scales. The imaging component will leverage a novel quantum dot technology that enables detailed mapping of multiple protein expression pathways within a single sample. Fluorescence in situ hybridization imaging will be used to measure DNA content. Whole-slide digitization will enable computer algorithms to capture molecular profiles of hundreds of millions of cells, calculating quantitative features to describe their expression patterns and DNA content. Biologically meaningful descriptions of each cell will be generated using a novel active machine learning classifier to annotate cells with an ontology describing molecular biology and cell anatomy, enabling slides to be analyzed in a biological context. Cell boundaries, features, and annotations will be integrated through the Pathology Analytic Imaging Standards (PAIS) database to provide support for data mining analysis. Mining methods will be developed to find the enrichment of cellular phenotypes, and to analyze the spatial layout of cells with respect to structures like blood vessels to discover the influence of the tissue microenvironment on key expression pathways in surrounding cells. These tools will be applied to studies of glioblastoma brain tumors, but are relevant for studies of other solid tissue diseases. The scientific study wil use tissues resected in a novel clinical trial that accurately defines the invading tumor margin, bulk and necrosis-rich core. Tissues will be analyzed for gene expression and imaging to generate a paired genomic-imaging profile for each region. Mining the imaging and gene expression profiles of these regions will identify intra-tumoral differences in cellular phenotypes and illustrate the extent of variation in genomic classifications. The paired imaging and gene expression profiles will also be mined to determine relationships between specific expression classes and the imaging observations to illustrate a complete picture of heterogeneity. A project repository will be deployed to disseminate images, analysis pipelines and analytic results. This repository will provide a public resource for brain tumor research and access to open source tools.                  PROJECT NARRATIVE Developing effective treatments for disease requires an understanding of their molecular mechanisms.

"Multimodal Biomarkers in Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K01 award will support my development as an independent investigator with a translational research program that specializes in the cognitive and biological basis of neurodegenerative diseases such as frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Candidate: My research experience as a cognitive neuroscientist ideally positions me to achieve my career goal of becoming an independent investigator with expertise on the cognitive and biological basis of neurodegenerative disease. I have strong cognitive training with an M.Sc in Psycholinguistics and Ph.D in Psychology from the University of Edinburgh, where I was supported by an NRSA Individual Predoctoral Award. During my postdoctoral IGERT fellowship at the Institute for Research in Cognitive Science at the University of Pennsylvania, I was awarded an NRSA Individual Postdoctoral Fellowship Award to investigate the role of decision-making in language. In this research I have gained experience investigating neurodegenerative disease patients comparatively in order to obtain converging evidence to complement fMRI studies of healthy adults. I have become increasingly interested in translating my research to optimize the diagnosis and treatment of patients with neurodegenerative diseases. I was recently award the Society for the Neurobiology of Language Postdoctoral Merit Award in recognition of my novel research investigating how social limitations in patients contribute to difficulty in discourse. I have committed to four years of clinical research the NIH Loan Repayment Program, and I intend to commit to clinical research for the duration of my career. I have learned that cognitive and neuroimaging studies provide only one perspective on neurodegenerative diseases. In this proposal, I plan to gain the necessary expertise in biological aspects of FTLD and related conditions to complement my past experiences, and thus achieve my goal of becoming a multifaceted independent investigator with expertise in the cognitive and biological basis for neurodegenerative diseases. With the support of this K01, I will develop expertise to conduct investigations of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), genetic, and neuropathological aspects of neurodegenerative diseases. I will ultimately integrate the biological expertise gained in this proposal with language studies from my cognitive neuroscience research in an effort to identify non-invasive biomarkers that can be used to screen patients for clinical trials and to measure the efficacy of disease-modifying agents. Environment: This award will be conducted at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in the Department of Neurology, the Center for Neurodegenerative Disease Research (CNDR), and the Penn Bioinformatics Center where I have strong institutional support. The proposed institution is an exceptional environment that has expert centers for neuroimaging, cerebrospinal fluid biomarker analysis, a leading genetic research core, expert neuropathology, outstanding biostatisical support, and relevant clinical research laboratories. The University of Pennsylvania is unique in comparison to other institutions in the country because all of the above methods are available in one center. My mentor, Dr. Murray Grossman, and my co-mentor, Dr. John Trojanowksi, have international reputations for neurodegenerative disease research. My career development will also be supported by my co-mentor, Dr. Lyle Ungar, who has extensive expertise in statistical learning algorithms and in the analysis of proteomic and genomics datasets. Together, this mentorship team will facilitate my development as an independent investigator by providing access to existing and future collaborators, laboratory resources, and exceptional training environments. The CNDR is a world- leading center for neurodegenerative disease research with human and animal models of disease and exceptional translational science. Biofluid biomarker experience is extensive, and several national biofluid cores are centered at Penn (e.g. ADNI). There is a wealth of internationally-recognized neuroimaging expertise at the University of Pennsylvania in the Penn Imaging and Computer Science Laboratory, and I will benefit by integrating neuroimaging resources from these facilities with other modalities of biomarker research. Training: I will develop my expertise in the biological basis of neurodegenerative disease with the support of my mentor, Dr. Murray Grossman, and my co-mentors, Dr. John Trojanowski and Dr. Lyle Ungar. Specifically, with Dr. Trojanowksi I will engage in training related to biofluid and genetic biomarkers of FTLD. I will develop advanced neuroimaging skills and cutting-edge biostatistical methods with Dr. Ungar. Each of these training modalities will be supported by complementary formal coursework, participation in seminars, attendance of conferences, and regularly scheduled meetings with mentorship team. Research: FTLD is a neurodegenerative disease affecting approximately 15 out of 100,000 individuals. In recent years detailed neuropathological investigations at autopsy have demonstrated distinct sources of histopathological abnormalities in FTLD, including the presence of tau inclusions (FTLD-tau) and TDP-43 proteinopathies (FTLD-TDP). However, there are currently no in vivo methods for discriminating between FTLD-tau and FTLD-TDP. There is an urgent need to improve the in vivo diagnosis of FTLD to appropriately enter patients into emerging clinical trials, and to develop sensitive and specific endpoints in trials that can quantify response to these treatments. The overall research aim of this proposal is to develop multimodal methods to improve in vivo diagnosis of FTLD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) affects approximately 15 out of 100,000 adults. Detailed neuropathological investigations at autopsy have identified two distinct sources of histopathological changes that contribute to FTLD. However, there are currently no in vivo methods for diagnosing pathological subtypes of FTLD. There is an urgent need to identify in vivo diagnosis methods to facilitate the identification of appropriate patients to enter into emerging disease-modifying drug treatment trials. The overall aim of this project is to identify multimodal biomarkers of FTLD.",Multimodal Biomarkers in Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration,8581245,K01AG043503,"['Data Set ', ' Foundations ', ' Future

"A Cyber-Informatics Approach to Studying Migration and Environmental Cancer Risk     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The World-Wide Web (Web 1.0) and online social media (Web 2.0) have revolutionized the ways medical knowledge is disseminated and health information is exchanged and shared among patients, supporters, and health care providers. Online patient communities have been expanding at an impressive rate with millions of active participants from all age groups. Recent studies on researching and analyzing social media contents for health-related applications show that this uprising cyber-trend leads to valuable knowledge, traditionally acquired with scientific methods such as observational epidemiological studies. This new mode for information acquisition is particularly advantageous for studies requiring long period of data curation. We propose to leverage the power of online contents, including user-generated contents on social network sites, to tackle NCI¿s second provocative question on complex migration patterns and their effect on environmental cancer risk. We hypothesize that the rich amount of personal information shared openly among cancer patients and cancer-free people online can be effectively mined to generate new knowledge on the topic, which cannot be easily uncovered with conventional migrant studies in our modern economy with population mobility patterns far more complex and dynamic than those observed in the past. To achieve our goal, we will build upon our unique cyber-informatics experience at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) on ultra-scale searching, identifying, and understanding free-structured web content. Specifically, we will develop domain-specific informatics tools to automatically reconstruct people's spatiotemporal lifelines, link them to spatiotemporal environmental data available from online sources such as the Environmental Protection Agency, and mine them using machine learning methods to search for salient associations between changes of migration-influenced environmental exposure and cancer risk. These tools will be individually validated and the overall approach will be carefully tested to understand its capabilities, methodological challenges, and practical limitations (if any) for knowledge discovery and scientific explorations in environmental cancer epidemiology. This study has the potential to provide a powerful complementary approach to the standard paradigm of observational epidemiological research. It will offer a fully automated and cost-effective way to discover new trends and monitor evolving ones on the impact of modern population migration patterns and environmental cancer risk. Such information could help cancer epidemiologists and health policy makers generate and prioritize study hypotheses worth testing with carefully controlled and properly powered (but also long term and costly) epidemiological studies.          Web mining has emerged in different domains as a powerful approach to harvesting knowledge of unprecedented quantity, comprehensiveness, and diversity. In this study we propose to pursue web mining in the environmental cancer risk domain. We will develop dedicated cyber-informatics algorithms and tools to (i) automatically search disparate online sources for retrieving and integrating contents related to individuals� cancer history and spatiotemporal environmental exposure profiles, and to (ii) effectively synthesize this information to accelerate knowledge discovery on environmental cancer risk change due to an individual's migration activities.

"Integrated Public Use Microdata Series: North Atlantic Population Project    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Research teams in the United States, Britain, Canada, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden have worked in close coordination to create the North Atlantic Population Project (NAPP), a massive integrated cross-national microdatabase that provides a baseline for studies of demographic change and opens fresh paths for spatiotemporal data analysis. We now propose improvements that will multiply the power of the NAPP infrastructure. We have three major aims: (1) Triple the size of the database to approximately 365 million records, adding 40 new datasets for the period 1787 to 1930 from Albania, Britain, Canada, Denmark, Egypt, Iceland, Ireland, Germany, Norway, Mexico, Sweden, and the United States. (2) Leverage our innovative record-linkage technology to create linked national panels that will allow expanded longitudinal analyses. (3) Connect the past to the present by merging NAPP with the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS), simplifying analysis of long-run change and ensuring long-run preservation and maintenance of the database. The landscape of scientific research on the human population is shifting. It is no longer sufficient just to study the relationships among variables at a particular moment in time. Researchers around the world now recognize that to understand the large-scale processes that are transforming society, we must investigate long-term change. The goal of this project is to provide the infrastructure to make such analysis possible. NAPP will make a strategic contribution to demographic infrastructure by providing a baseline for the study of changes in the demography and health of European and North American populations. In each country, NAPP provides the earliest census microdata available. Models and descriptions based on historical experience underlie both theories of past change and projections into the future. The NAPP data provide a unique laboratory for the study of economic and demographic processes; this kind of empirical foundation is essential for testing social and economic theory. The proposed work will be carried out by a team of highly-skilled researchers with unparalleled expertise and experience in data integration and record linkage. Collaborators include leading researchers from the University of Minnesota and the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research, and local experts from each of the participating countries. Centralized support for international collaboration will leverage the investments of each country and allow us to create an extraordinary resource for comparative social and economic research.        The North Atlantic Population Project (NAPP) provides fundamental infrastructure for scientific research, education, and policy-making and will allow social scientists to make comparisons across Northern Europe, the Mediterranean, and North America during three centuries of transformative change.

"Bioinformatics Strategies for Multidimensional Brain Imaging Genetics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Today's generation of multi-modal imaging systems produces massive high dimensional data sets, which when coupled with high throughput genotyping data such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), provide exciting opportunities to enhance our understanding of phenotypic characteristics and the genetic architecture of human diseases. However, the unprecedented scale and complexity of these data sets have presented critical computational bottlenecks requiring new concepts and enabling tools. To address these challenges, using the study of Alzheimer's disease (AD) as a test bed, this project will develop and validate novel bioinformatics strategies for multidimensional brain imaging genetics. Aim 1 is to develop a novel bi- multivariate analysis strategy, S3K-CCA, for studying imaging genetic associations. Existing imaging genetics methods are typically designed to discover single-SNP-single-QT, single-SNP-multi-QT or multi-SNP-single- QT associations, and have limited power in revealing complex relationships between interlinked genetic markers and correlated brain phenotypes. To overcome this limitation, S3K-CCA is designed to be a sparse bi- multivariate learning model that simultaneously uses multiple response variables with multiple predictors for analyzing large-scale multi-modal neurogenomic data. Aim 2 is to develop HD-BIG, a visualization and systems biology framework for integrative analysis of High-Dimensional Brain Imaging Genetics data. Machine learning strategies to seamlessly incorporate valuable domain knowledge to produce biologically meaningful results is still an under-explored area in imaging genetics. In this aim, we will develop a user-friendly heat map interface to visualize high-dimensional results, adjust learning parameters and strategies, interact with existing bioinformatics resources and tools, and facilitate visual exploratory and systems biology analysis. A novel imaging genetic enrichment analysis (IGEA) method will be developed to identify relevant genetic pathways and associated brain circuits, and to reveal complex relationships among them. Aim 3 is to evaluate the proposed S3K-CCA and IGEA methods and the HD-BIG framework using both simulated and real imaging genetics data. This project is expected to produce novel bioinformatics algorithms and tools for comprehensive joint analysis of large scale heterogeneous imaging genetics data. The availability of these powerful methods is critical to the success of many imaging genetics initiatives. In addition, they can also help enable new computational applications in other areas of biomedical research where systematic and integrative analysis of large-scale multi-modal data is critical. Using AD as an exemplar, the proposed methods will demonstrate the potential for enhancing mechanistic understanding of complex disorders, which can benefit public health outcomes by facilitating diagnostic and therapeutic progress.              Public Health Relevance (Narrative) Recent advances in multi-modal imaging and high throughput genotyping techniques provide exciting opportunities to enhance our understanding of phenotypic characteristics and underlying genetic mechanisms associated with human diseases.

"Statistical Modeling of Complex Traits in Genetic Reference Super-Populations     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Genetic crosses in model organisms play an essential role in understanding the heritable architecture of medically relevant phenotypes. Traditionally, such crosses have tended to be on a small scale with either limited power to detect genetic effects or limited resolution to localize causal variants. Recently, however, the emergence of larger-scale interdisciplinary research, cheaper genotyping and parallel advances in human genetics, have spurred the development of more sophisticated and powerful experimental designs. Genetic Resource Populations (GRPs) use economies of scale to provide cost-effective and replicable platforms for genetic studies. This project concerns the largest, most ambitious GRP in mouse genetics to date, the Collaborative Cross (CC), and a series of crosses and designs related to or derived from it: the Diversity Outbred (DO) cross, the CC Recombinant Inbred Cross (CC-RIX) and the diallel. Experiments on each separate cross provide distinct information about the heritable architecture of a target complex disease. In combination, this Genetic Reference Super-Population (GRSP) potentially provides an unparalleled basis for cross-study replication and integration in mouse genetics. This project aims to develop statistical methods that advance the current state of complex trait analysis of these populations separately, and, by exploiting the unique structure that connects them, proposes to develop a statistical framework that allows for their joint use.  Aim 1 develops a Bayesian probabilistic framework for haplotype-based analysis of quantitative trait loci (QTL). Aim 1a develops a statistical software module for flexible haplotype-based analysis, which can be ex- tended by the researcher to model a rich variety of designs and disease types. Aim 1b will adapt machine learning techniques to provide posterior inference of the allelic series of a QTL. Aim 1c will incorporate Bayesian modeling of polygenic effects.  Aim 2 and 3 concern joint analysis, building on the foundation set by Aim 1. Aim 2 develops methods to optimize experimental design of follow-up studies in one population given results from another. Aim 2a uses the diallel to inform design of CC/CC-RIX/DO experiments. Aim 2b uses partial data on CC/CC-RIX/DO to guide collection of additional data. Aim 3 explores models for jointly analyzing multiple populations in the GRSP, using complementary datasets to stabilize analysis at single QTL (Aim 3a) and across multiple QTL (Aim 3b).  These aims address specific and persistent challenges in the cost-effective design and efficient analysis of multiparent genetic data, in particular the CC, DO, CC-RIX and diallel. The project will generate tools useful for a wide range of model organism crosses and can be applied to the genetic study of any complex disease.              The proposed research will lead to improvements in the analysis and design of genetic studies on animal models of human disease. Because the project focuses on statistical methodology applied to experimental mouse populations, the scientific output of the project is expected to be applicable to basic research focusing on any medical condition that can be studied in the mouse.

"Understanding the Mechanism of Social Network Influence in Health Outcomes throug     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Research in the design and implementation of the SMASH (Semantic Mining of Activity, Social, and Health data) system will address a critical need for data mining tools to help understanding the influence of healthcare social networks, such as YesiWell, on sustained weight loss where the data are multi-dimensional, temporal, semantically heterogeneous, and very sensitive. System design and implementation will rest on five specific aims. The first aim is to develop a novel data mining and statistical learning approach to understand key factors that enable spread of healthy behaviors in a social network (Aim 1). We propose to develop a formal and expressive Semantic Web ontology for the concepts used in describing the semantic features of healthcare data and social networks. We will then bridge the domain knowledge in healthcare and social networks with formal mappings across those ontological concepts (Aim 2). Next, we propose novel recommendation approaches building on top of the influence modeling and prediction. In addition, we will develop methods to utilize the recommendation as a means to better organize the social network such that the adoption of optimal health behaviors in the network can spread quickly and sustainably (Aim 3). To protect the privacy of human subjects during the data mining process for social network and health data, we consider the enforcement of differential privacy through a privacy preserving analysis layer. We will develop novel solutions to preserve differential privacy for mining dynamic health data and social activities of human subjects (Aim 4). To support this research, we will develop a web- accessible portal so that other researchers with little training i data mining will have shared access to data mining tools, ontologies, and social network analysis results (Aim 5). At the end of this project, data resources, tools, ontologies, and technologies will be made available to the larger research community. This work is an inter-disciplinary collaboration among the PI, Dejing Dou, Co-I Daniel Lowd, both experts in data mining and machine learning, and Jessica Greene, an expert in health policy, at the University of Oregon, Brigitte Piniewski MD, the lead of YesiWell, at PeaceHealth Laboratories, Ruoming Jin, an expert in complex network mining, at Kent State University, Xintao Wu, an expert in privacy preserving mining, at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, David Kil, the previous Chief Scientist at SKT Americas and program manager of YesiWell, and the founder of HealthMantic, and Junfeng Sun, a mathematical statistician at the NIH and an expert in design of clinical trials.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Frequent social contacts are effective to sustained weight loss.

"Next generation risk variant discovery in a highly penetrant OCD subtype    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed five-year K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award outlines a program of career development and research activities that will assist the principal investigator to transition to an independent research career and prepare her to tackle the challenges ahead in unraveling the genetic basis of complex psychiatric phenotypes. The innovative research plan details an approach to mapping risk for a strongly genetic subtype of obsessive compulsive (OCD) and comorbid tic disorders by generating and analyzing whole-exome sequence in select families to identify risk alleles. These efforts will be guided by pilot identity-by-descent, homozygosity, and copy number variant data in the comprehensively phenotyped OCD Collaborative Genetic Study (OCGS) multiplex family dataset. The OCD+tic phenotype is an ideal complex disorder for next generation genetic mapping. The clear phenotype, possibly reduced heterogeneity, and strong genetic effects make it an excellent candidate for the application of methodologies recently proven successful in Mendelian disorders. While the principle investigator has a strong background in child psychiatry and molecular genetics, the knowledge and skills required to master emerging genetic technologies such as next generation sequencing (NGS) are novel and complex. The short-term goals of this application are to gain proficiency in the methods that will drive the field over the coming decades, learn the statistical, computational, and informatics tools that will support this research, continue to develop skills in study design and interpretation, and refine and incorporate clinical and phenotyping skills. A program of coursework, supervision, and hands-on application of these approaches will equip the applicant in the long-term to integrate molecular, computational, and phenotypic data to make meaningful contributions to the field of psychiatric genetics.

"Pharmaco Response Signatures and Disease Mechanism     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the HMS LINCS Center is to delineate the fundamental principles of cellular response to perturbagens at the level of single-cells and cell populations and to make response data routinely available via web-based browse, query and programmatic interfaces. This will involve the development and testing of new measurement methods, computational algorithms, and response signatures for diverse human cell types exposed to perturbations individually and in combination. We will emphasize the systematic collection of data not currently available in existing public databases including live and fixed-cell imaging, biochemical data on signaling proteins and multi-factorial drug-response phenotypes. A focus on diverse transformed and primary cells, including those derived from healthy and diseased donors, and on clinical grade small molecules (kinase inhibitors and epigenome drugs) will increase the translational impact of our work. The proposed LINCS Center represents a continuation of a program in operation for ~3.5 years under a LINCS pilot phase U54 award. We will expand the scope and sophistication of our Center, devoting  significant effort to (i) improving the quality of data analysis and visualization, particularly wih respect to the  complexities of perturbagen polypharmacy (ii) accelerating the release of perturbagen-response signatures  using methods that have been demonstrated to yield reliable and informative data, with a particular  emphasis on primary and non-transformed cells (iii) developing and applying new measurement methods,  particularly mass spectrometry for analysis of cell populations and live-cell imaging for analysis of single cells.  The work will involve nine complementary but independent aims. In Data Generation, Aim 1 will perform systematic analysis of perturbagen responses at a single-cell level. Aim 2 will collect multiplex protein and mRNA data on perturbagen response using a set of complementary imaging, mass spectrometry and bead-based assays. Aim 3 will apply LINCS methods to non-transformed immune cells and induced pluripotent stem cells, and explore if signatures can guide a detailed medicinal chemistry campaign. In Data Analysis, Aim 4 will construct perturbagen-response signatures using statistical modeling, network inference and machine learning methods. Aim 5 will develop new approaches to understanding and analyzing drug interactions on multiple phenotypes in single cells. Aim 6 will develop a novel compressed sensing framework for analyzing the poly-pharmacology of kinase inhibitors. Aim 7 will enhance the query, browse and explore functions of the HMS LINCS website and database and its integration with the UCSC Genome Browser. In Community Interaction and Outreach, Aim 8 will implement diverse training and outreach activities, including collaboration with LINCS and non-LINCS research groups. In Administration, Aim 9 will ensure effective management of the Center, sustained access to tools and data produced within the LINCS Project, and compliance with program goals.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Disease networks are complex interactions between multiple proteins. Precise understanding of the multifactorial perturbations imposed on multi-component networks is a crucial step in the development of a rational approach to drug discovery and personalization of therapy.

"SPORE in Skin Cancer The incidence of melanoma has risen dramatically in recent years, but no therapy has improved overall survival for the majority of patients with unresectable metastatic disease. The University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute (UPCI) Melanoma and Skin Cancer Program (MSCP) will continue to conduct a Specialized Program of Research Excellence (SPORE) to improve our understanding of molecular and immunologic mechanisms of cancer progression and to validate prognostic and predictive biomarkers for personalized treatment of advanced melanoma and cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL). Of our 4 Projects, 1 is continued from the prior funding period, and 3 new projects have been derived from developmental research conducted in the last period; 1 of the prior SPORE projects will be continued with independent ROI funding. Our highly integrated approach leverages complementary expertise in melanoma, oncology, dermatology, immunology, biostatistics, bioinformatics, machine learning, genomics, proteomics, and biomarker discovery to test hypotheses central to the improvement of therapeutic outcome in skin cancers. Regardless of clinical outcomes, these Projects will also generate urgently needed mechanistic data to inform development of new therapeutic strategies and pathways through which to monitor relapse and progression. Our 4 Projects will evaluate: (1) the prognostic and predictive value of the pro-inflammatory response and markers of immune suppression in relation to ipilimumab and interferon (IFN)¿ adjuvant therapy (leveraging an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group-led adjuvant trial); (2) an engineered, 3-antigen dendritic cell vaccine and IFN¿ boost in patients with metastatic melanoma; (3) the safety and efficacy of vemurafenib modulation of immunotherapy with IFN¿2b in patients with metastatic melanoma; and (4) an entirely new personalized microneedle vaccination technology in patients with melanoma and CTCL. The Administrative Core (A) coordinates the clinical research and provides scientific and fiscal oversight of the entire SPORE. The Biospecimen Core (B) is housed in the UPCI Immunologic Monitoring and Cellular Products Laboratory, where all tissue banking, biospecimen processing, and immune assays are conducted. The Biostatistics Core (C) and Informatics Core (D) support all projects with data analysis and management, respectively. We will continue to solicit, review, and fund applications for the career development and developmental research programs, which in the prior funding period led to the design of a new full project in this application (Project 3)  and the promotion of career development recipients to co-investigators and a project leader. The goal of this application is to use a multi-disciplinary approach to improve outcomes in skin cancer and in particular, metastatic melanoma, a disease with a 15% 5-year survival rate. We will improve treatment and outcomes for skin cancer patients by identifying new ways to treat the disease based on the biology of the individual patient's tumor and new biomarkers that predict risk

"Multimodal Biomarkers in Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K01 award will support my development as an independent investigator with a translational research program that specializes in the cognitive and biological basis of neurodegenerative diseases such as frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Candidate: My research experience as a cognitive neuroscientist ideally positions me to achieve my career goal of becoming an independent investigator with expertise on the cognitive and biological basis of neurodegenerative disease. I have strong cognitive training with an M.Sc in Psycholinguistics and Ph.D in Psychology from the University of Edinburgh, where I was supported by an NRSA Individual Predoctoral Award. During my postdoctoral IGERT fellowship at the Institute for Research in Cognitive Science at the University of Pennsylvania, I was awarded an NRSA Individual Postdoctoral Fellowship Award to investigate the role of decision-making in language. In this research I have gained experience investigating neurodegenerative disease patients comparatively in order to obtain converging evidence to complement fMRI studies of healthy adults. I have become increasingly interested in translating my research to optimize the diagnosis and treatment of patients with neurodegenerative diseases. I was recently award the Society for the Neurobiology of Language Postdoctoral Merit Award in recognition of my novel research investigating how social limitations in patients contribute to difficulty in discourse. I have committed to four years of clinical research the NIH Loan Repayment Program, and I intend to commit to clinical research for the duration of my career. I have learned that cognitive and neuroimaging studies provide only one perspective on neurodegenerative diseases. In this proposal, I plan to gain the necessary expertise in biological aspects of FTLD and related conditions to complement my past experiences, and thus achieve my goal of becoming a multifaceted independent investigator with expertise in the cognitive and biological basis for neurodegenerative diseases. With the support of this K01, I will develop expertise to conduct investigations of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), genetic, and neuropathological aspects of neurodegenerative diseases. I will ultimately integrate the biological expertise gained in this proposal with language studies from my cognitive neuroscience research in an effort to identify non-invasive biomarkers that can be used to screen patients for clinical trials and to measure the efficacy of disease-modifying agents. Environment: This award will be conducted at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in the Department of Neurology, the Center for Neurodegenerative Disease Research (CNDR), and the Penn Bioinformatics Center where I have strong institutional support. The proposed institution is an exceptional environment that has expert centers for neuroimaging, cerebrospinal fluid biomarker analysis, a leading genetic research core, expert neuropathology, outstanding biostatisical support, and relevant clinical research laboratories. The University of Pennsylvania is unique in comparison to other institutions in the country because all of the above methods are available in one center. My mentor, Dr. Murray Grossman, and my co-mentor, Dr. John Trojanowksi, have international reputations for neurodegenerative disease research. My career development will also be supported by my co-mentor, Dr. Lyle Ungar, who has extensive expertise in statistical learning algorithms and in the analysis of proteomic and genomics datasets. Together, this mentorship team will facilitate my development as an independent investigator by providing access to existing and future collaborators, laboratory resources, and exceptional training environments. The CNDR is a world- leading center for neurodegenerative disease research with human and animal models of disease and exceptional translational science. Biofluid biomarker experience is extensive, and several national biofluid cores are centered at Penn (e.g. ADNI). There is a wealth of internationally-recognized neuroimaging expertise at the University of Pennsylvania in the Penn Imaging and Computer Science Laboratory, and I will benefit by integrating neuroimaging resources from these facilities with other modalities of biomarker research. Training: I will develop my expertise in the biological basis of neurodegenerative disease with the support of my mentor, Dr. Murray Grossman, and my co-mentors, Dr. John Trojanowski and Dr. Lyle Ungar. Specifically, with Dr. Trojanowksi I will engage in training related to biofluid and genetic biomarkers of FTLD. I will develop advanced neuroimaging skills and cutting-edge biostatistical methods with Dr. Ungar. Each of these training modalities will be supported by complementary formal coursework, participation in seminars, attendance of conferences, and regularly scheduled meetings with mentorship team. Research: FTLD is a neurodegenerative disease affecting approximately 15 out of 100,000 individuals. In recent years detailed neuropathological investigations at autopsy have demonstrated distinct sources of histopathological abnormalities in FTLD, including the presence of tau inclusions (FTLD-tau) and TDP-43 proteinopathies (FTLD-TDP). However, there are currently no in vivo methods for discriminating between FTLD-tau and FTLD-TDP. There is an urgent need to improve the in vivo diagnosis of FTLD to appropriately enter patients into emerging clinical trials, and to develop sensitive and specific endpoints in trials that can quantify response to these treatments. The overall research aim of this proposal is to develop multimodal methods to improve in vivo diagnosis of FTLD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) affects approximately 15 out of 100,000 adults. Detailed neuropathological investigations at autopsy have identified two distinct sources of histopathological changes that contribute to FTLD. However, there are currently no in vivo methods for diagnosing pathological subtypes of FTLD. There is an urgent need to identify in vivo diagnosis methods to facilitate the identification of appropriate patients to enter into emerging disease-modifying drug treatment trials. The overall aim of this project is to identify multimodal biomarkers of FTLD.",Multimodal Biomarkers in Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration,8707928,K01AG043503,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', '

"Statistical Modeling of Complex Traits in Genetic Reference Super-Populations     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Genetic crosses in model organisms play an essential role in understanding the heritable architecture of medically relevant phenotypes. Traditionally, such crosses have tended to be on a small scale with either limited power to detect genetic effects or limited resolution to localize causal variants. Recently, however, the emergence of larger-scale interdisciplinary research, cheaper genotyping and parallel advances in human genetics, have spurred the development of more sophisticated and powerful experimental designs. Genetic Resource Populations (GRPs) use economies of scale to provide cost-effective and replicable platforms for genetic studies. This project concerns the largest, most ambitious GRP in mouse genetics to date, the Collaborative Cross (CC), and a series of crosses and designs related to or derived from it: the Diversity Outbred (DO) cross, the CC Recombinant Inbred Cross (CC-RIX) and the diallel. Experiments on each separate cross provide distinct information about the heritable architecture of a target complex disease. In combination, this Genetic Reference Super-Population (GRSP) potentially provides an unparalleled basis for cross-study replication and integration in mouse genetics. This project aims to develop statistical methods that advance the current state of complex trait analysis of these populations separately, and, by exploiting the unique structure that connects them, proposes to develop a statistical framework that allows for their joint use.  Aim 1 develops a Bayesian probabilistic framework for haplotype-based analysis of quantitative trait loci (QTL). Aim 1a develops a statistical software module for flexible haplotype-based analysis, which can be ex- tended by the researcher to model a rich variety of designs and disease types. Aim 1b will adapt machine learning techniques to provide posterior inference of the allelic series of a QTL. Aim 1c will incorporate Bayesian modeling of polygenic effects.  Aim 2 and 3 concern joint analysis, building on the foundation set by Aim 1. Aim 2 develops methods to optimize experimental design of follow-up studies in one population given results from another. Aim 2a uses the diallel to inform design of CC/CC-RIX/DO experiments. Aim 2b uses partial data on CC/CC-RIX/DO to guide collection of additional data. Aim 3 explores models for jointly analyzing multiple populations in the GRSP, using complementary datasets to stabilize analysis at single QTL (Aim 3a) and across multiple QTL (Aim 3b).  These aims address specific and persistent challenges in the cost-effective design and efficient analysis of multiparent genetic data, in particular the CC, DO, CC-RIX and diallel. The project will generate tools useful for a wide range of model organism crosses and can be applied to the genetic study of any complex disease.              The proposed research will lead to improvements in the analysis and design of genetic studies on animal models of human disease. Because the project focuses on statistical methodology applied to experimental mouse populations, the scientific output of the project is expected to be applicable to basic research focusing on any medical condition that can be studied in the mouse.

"Multiscale Framework for Molecular Heterogeneity Analysis     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genomic profiling has become a routine practice in selecting treatments for many diseases, enabling the classification of patients into categories that associate with improved outcomes for specific treatments. One potential detractor to this approach is the tremendous heterogeneity in tissues used for profiling. Genomic classifications, obtained from a relatively small biopsy, are subject to influence from broad, regional variations in the affected tissue. Heterogeneity on a cellular scale can also obscure the target of treatment, as cells with distinct molecular profiles are homogenized in genomic profiling. Realizing better therapies will depend greatly on the ability to understand molecular heterogeneity within an individual, a challenge that necessitates new approaches to organize, analyze and integrate data from multiple spatial and molecular scales. This proposal describes an informatics framework to characterizing heterogeneity for tissue based studies. The framework will combine imaging informatics with genomics to describe molecular heterogeneity at multiple spatial and molecular scales. The imaging component will leverage a novel quantum dot technology that enables detailed mapping of multiple protein expression pathways within a single sample. Fluorescence in situ hybridization imaging will be used to measure DNA content. Whole-slide digitization will enable computer algorithms to capture molecular profiles of hundreds of millions of cells, calculating quantitative features to describe their expression patterns and DNA content. Biologically meaningful descriptions of each cell will be generated using a novel active machine learning classifier to annotate cells with an ontology describing molecular biology and cell anatomy, enabling slides to be analyzed in a biological context. Cell boundaries, features, and annotations will be integrated through the Pathology Analytic Imaging Standards (PAIS) database to provide support for data mining analysis. Mining methods will be developed to find the enrichment of cellular phenotypes, and to analyze the spatial layout of cells with respect to structures like blood vessels to discover the influence of the tissue microenvironment on key expression pathways in surrounding cells. These tools will be applied to studies of glioblastoma brain tumors, but are relevant for studies of other solid tissue diseases. The scientific study wil use tissues resected in a novel clinical trial that accurately defines the invading tumor margin, bulk and necrosis-rich core. Tissues will be analyzed for gene expression and imaging to generate a paired genomic-imaging profile for each region. Mining the imaging and gene expression profiles of these regions will identify intra-tumoral differences in cellular phenotypes and illustrate the extent of variation in genomic classifications. The paired imaging and gene expression profiles will also be mined to determine relationships between specific expression classes and the imaging observations to illustrate a complete picture of heterogeneity. A project repository will be deployed to disseminate images, analysis pipelines and analytic results. This repository will provide a public resource for brain tumor research and access to open source tools.                 PROJECT NARRATIVE Developing effective treatments for disease requires an understanding of their molecular mechanisms. The software tools created by this research will enable researchers to better identify variations in the mechanisms of disease within an individual, and to develop and apply more effective therapies to improve patient outcomes.",Multiscale Framework for Molecular Heterogeneity Analysis,8710341,K22LM011576,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Biopsy ', ' vascular ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' tumors in the brain ', ' Brain Tumors ', ' Brain Neoplasia ', ' Brain Neoplasms ', ' Cells ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Environment ', ' Gene Expression ', ' spongioblastoma multiforme ', ' glioblastoma multiforme ', ' Grade IV Astrocytoma ', ' Grade IV Astrocytic Tumor ', ' Grade IV Astrocytic Neoplasm ', ' Glioblastoma ', ' neuroglia tumor ', ' neuroglia neoplasm ', ' glial-derived tumor ', ' Neuroglial Tumor ', ' Neuroglial Neoplasm ', ' Glial Tumor ', ' Glial Neoplasm ', ' Glial Cell Tumors ', ' Glioma ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Immunohistochemistry Staining Method ', ' Immunohistochemistry Cell/Tissue ', ' Immunohistochemistry ', ' Maps ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Microscopy ', ' Mining ', ' DNA Molecular Biology ', ' Molecular Biology ', ' Necrotic ', ' Necrosis ', ' O2 element ', ' O element ', ' Oxygen ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' chromosome complement ', ' DNA Ploidy ', ' DNA Index ', ' DNA Content ', ' Ploidies ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Software Tools ', ' Technology ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Measures ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization ', ' FISH analysis ', ' FISH Technique ', ' FISH Technic ', ' Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Solid ', ' Diffuse ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Oxygen Deficiency ', ' Hypoxic ', ' Hypoxia ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Measurement ', ' Experiential Learning ', ' Active Learning ', ' Descriptor ', ' Simulate ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' human tissue ', ' Event ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Slide ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' Animal Model ', ' Informatics ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Categories ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Property ', ' repository ', ' Genomics ', ' protein expression ', ' Q-Dot ', ' Quantum Dots ', ' small molecule ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' tissue processing ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' molecular signature ', ' molecular profile ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' Expression Signature ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' Resolution ', ' Cellular Anatomy ', ' Cell Anatomy ', ' Subcellular Anatomy ', ' Conduct Clinical Trials ', ' Invaded ', ' Ontology ', ' Signaling Molecule ', ' Molecular ', ' Resected ', ' Process ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' imaging informatics ', ' molecular scale ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' computer algorithm ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' open source ', ' comparative ', ' tumor ', ' routine practice ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' exomes ', ' exome ', ' ']",NLM,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K22,2014,162303,GA-05,-0.04852085644909116
"Integration and visualization of diverse biological data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Modern genome-scale experimental techniques enable for the first time in biological research the comprehensive monitoring of the entire molecular regulatory events leading to disease. Their integrative analyses hold the promise of generating specific, experimentally testable hypotheses, paving the way for a systems-level molecular view of complex disease. However, systems-level modeling of metazoan biology must address the challenges of: 1. biological complexity, including individual cell lineages and tissue types, 2. the increasingly large scale of data in higher organisms, and 3. the diversity of biomolecules and interaction mechanisms in the cell. The long-term goal of this research is to address these challenges through the development of bioinformatics frameworks for the study of gene function and regulation in complex biological systems thereby contributing to a greater understanding of human disease. In the initial funding period, we have developed accurate methods for integrating and visualizing diverse functional genomics data in S. cerevisiae and implemented them in interactive web-based systems for the biology community. Our methods have led to experimental discoveries of novel biology, are widely used by the yeast community, and are integrated with the SGD model organism database. We now propose to leverage our previous work to develop novel data integration and analysis methods and implement them in a public system for human data. In the proposed research period, we will create algorithms appropriate for integrating metazoan data in a tissue- and cell-lineage specific manner in health and disease. We will also develop novel hierarchical methods for predicting specific molecular interaction mechanisms and will extend our methods for integrating additional biomolecules. These methods will direct experiments focused on the glomerular kidney filter, a critical and complex component of the human vascular system whose dysfunction directly contributes to microvascular disease. Prediction of these cell-lineage specific functional networks will advance the understanding of the glomerulus function and its role in microvascular disease, leading to better clinical predictors, diagnoses, and treatments. From a technical perspective, application to glomerular biology will enable iterative improvement of the proposed methods based on experimental feedback. The end product of this research will be a general, robust, interactive, and automatically updated system for human data integration and analysis that will be freely available to the biomedical community. We will leverage parallel processing technologies (inspired by Google- type cloud computing solutions) to ensure interactive-analysis speed on the system. This system will allow biomedical researchers to synthesize, analyze, and visualize diverse data in human biology, enabling accurate predictions of biological networks and understanding their cell-lineage specificity and role in disease. Such integrative analyses will provide experimentally testable hypotheses, leading to a deeper understanding of complex disorders and paving the way to molecular-defined tissue targeted therapies and drug development.

"Secure Sharing of Clinical History & Genetic Data: Empowering Predictive Pers. Me    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Computer-assisted medicine is at a crossroads: medical care requires accurate data, but making such data widely available can create unacceptable risks to the privacy of individual patients. This tension between utility and privacy is especially acute in predictive personalized medicine (PPM). PPM holds the promise of making treatment decisions tailored to the individual based on her or his particular genetics and clinical history. Making PPM a reality requires running statistical, data mining and machine learning algorithms on combined genetic, clinical and demographic data to construct predictive models. Access to such data directly competes with the need for healthcare providers to protect the privacy of each patient's data, thus creating a tradeoff between model efficacy and privacy. Thus we find ourselves in an unfortunate standoff: significant medical advances that would result from more powerful mining of the data by a wider variety of researchers are hindered by significant privacy concerns on behalf of the patients represented in the data set. In this proposed work, we seek to develop and evaluate technology to resolve this standoff, enabling health practitioners and researchers to compute on privacy-sensitive medical records in order to make treatment decisions or create accurate models, while protecting patient privacy. We will evaluate our approach on a de-identified actual electronic medical record, with an average of 29 years of clinical history on each patient, and with detailed genetic data (650K SNPs) available for a subset of 5000 of the patients. This data set is available to us now through the Wisconsin Genomics Initiative, but only on a computer at the Marshfield Clinic. If successful our approach will make possible the sharing of this cutting-edge data set, and others like it that are now in development, including our ability to analyze this data at UW-Madison where we have thousands of processors available in our Condor pool. Our privacy approach integrates secure data access environments, including those appropriate to the use of laptops and cloud computing, with novel anonymization algorithms providing differential privacy guarantees for data and/or published results of data analysis. To this end, our specific aims are as follows:       AIM 1: Develop and deploy a secure local environment that, in combination with secure network functionality, will ensure end-to-end security and privacy for electronic medical records and biomedical datasets shared between clinical institutions and researchers.       AIM 2: Develop and deploy a secure virtual environment to allow large-scale, privacy-preserving data analysis ""in the cloud.""       AIM 3: Develop and evaluate privacy-preserving data mining algorithms for use with original (not anonymized) data sets consisting of electronic medical records and genetic data.       AIM 4: Develop and evaluate anonymizing data publishing algorithms and privacy guarantees that are appropriate to the complex structure present in electronic medical records with genetic data.            Project Narrative This project will develop an integrated approach to secure sharing of clinical and genetic data that based on algorithms for anonymization of data to achieve differential privacy guarantees, for privacy-preserving publication of data analysis results, and secure environments for data sharing that include addressing the increasing use of laptops and of cloud computing. The end goal of this project is to meet the competing demands of providing patients with both privacy and accurate predictive models based on clinical history and genetics.

"An Integrative Bioinformatics Approach to Study Single Cancer Cell Heterogeneity     DESCRIPTION:  My long term career goal is to become a leading expert in translational bioinformatics who creates, develops and applies computational and statistical methods to reveal landscapes of cancers and to identify strategies to cure cancers. Human cancers are highly heterogeneous. Such heterogeneity is the major source of the ultimate failure of most cancer agents. However, due to the limit of technologies, the intercellular heterogeneity has not been investigated genome wide, at single-cell level until recently. New technologies such as single-cell transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) and exome have revealed new insights and more profound complexity than was previously thought. However, so far these technologies are limited to one assay per cell. It remains a grand challenge to perform multiple, integrative assays from the same single tumor cell, in particular, from those derived from small tumor biopsies. Given the stochasticity at the single cell resolution, reproducibility and sensitivity ar daunting tasks. To overcome this challenge, I have started the single cancer cell sequencing analysis project, in collaboration with Dr. Sherman Weissman at Yale University, who is also my co-mentor of this K01 proposal. My immediate career goal is to identify genome-wide heterogeneity among single cancer cells, using the erythroleukemia K562 cell line. Towards this, I am proposing a research project on an integrative bioinformatics approach to analyze multiple types of genomics data generated from the same single leukemia cells, a timely and critical topic. Specifically, I am interested in studying the following specific aims: (1) buildinga bioinformatics pipeline to study heterogeneity of single-cell RNA-Seq, (2) building a bioinformatics pipeline to study CpG methylome of single cells, (3) building a bioinformatics pipeline to study single-cell Exome-Seq, and (4) integrate the RNA-Seq, methylome and Exome-Seq data generated from the same single cells. These single cells genomic data are provided by Dr. Sherman Weissman's lab from 30 single K562 erythroleukemia cells. I will first construct and validate in parallel, the RNA-Seq, methylome, and Exome-Seq bioinformatics pipelines optimized for single-cell analysis, and then develop and validate an integrative platform to analyze these multiple types of high-throughput data. To accomplish the research project, and to successfully transit from a junior faculty to an expert of the field, I have developed a career plan with my mentoring committee composed of four world-class experts in different fields relevant to Big Data Science: Primary Mentor Dr. Jason Moore in Bioinformatics from Dartmouth College, Co-mentor Dr. Sherman Weissman in Single-cell Genomics and Genetics from Yale University, Co-mentor Dr. Herbert Yu in Cancer Epidemiology from University of Hawaii Cancer Center and Co-mentor Dr. Jason Leigh in Big Data Visualization from the Information and Computer Science Department of University of Hawaii Manoa. I will primarily work with my four co-mentors for planning the development of my career during this award.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this K01 proposal is to integrate multiple types of high-throughput data, in particular, the transcriptome, exome-sequencing and CpG methylome data generated from single cancer cells. The proposed project is designed to address the urgent need for an integrative bioinformatics platform for mega-data generated from next-generation sequencing applications.

"Interactive Informatics Resource for Research-driven Cancer Proteomics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In 2013 over 1.6 million new cases of cancer are expected to be diagnosed and over 580,000 people are expected to die of the disease. Thus, continued research in the identification of new diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of cancer is necessary. Although cancer is widely recognized as a genomic disease, the directives of the DNA-based drivers are executed at the level of proteins and their biological functions, and the application of potential protein level biomarkers remains a compelling vision. Thus, a large investment has been made by NCI and other research centers in high-throughput global proteomics experiments to mine for novel biomarkers of cancer. However, few of these markers have come to fruition. We believe that one of the major challenges to the discovery of robust protein- or pathway-biomarker candidates from these large and complex proteomics datasets is due to naive data analysis approaches that do not take into account the underlying complexity of the proteome (e.g., splice variants, post- translational modifications). State-of-the-art statistical algorithms to improve the tasks of quality assessment, peptide and protein quantification, and pathway modeling that are designed to account for the design of the experiment have been developed; however access to these methodologies by the larger community is hindered since they are in the prototype stage and typically require knowledge of statistical programming. Furthermore, the likelihood of these tools moving to robust software is low since they are developed within the context of existing grants that do not support the transition from prototype to software. For the field of clinical proteomics to successfully identif new mechanistic etiologies of cancer requires not only high quality data with respect to the instrument, but also high quality statistical analysis of the data. This project proposes new informatics technology in the form of a robust, interactive and cross- platform software environment that will enable biomedical and biological scientists to perform in-depth analyses of global proteomics data from the point of quality assessment and normalization of raw inferred abundances (e.g., peak area) to the identification of protein biomarkers and enriched pathways. The software will be designed in a single programming language (Java) to assure easy installation across platforms with wizard-based data entry and advanced data reporting. Java will also support the development of advanced graphical user interfaces for data presentation and interactive graphics with a modern look and feel. This approach will ensure that scientists outside of the development institution can develop modules to include in the software or extensions for data integration without challenges of re-compiling the application. The software modules to be developed under this project are Aim 1) peptide and protein level quality assessment and quantification, Aim 2) protein biomarker discovery via exploratory data analysis and machine learning, and Aim 3) pathway biomarker discovery through integration with the NCI Protein Interaction Database.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  For the past decade, cancer researchers have been utilizing global proteomics analyses to extensively categorize proteins and other molecular species in hopes of identifying distinctive features of cancer cells that not only explain the biology, but alo enable better patient care. Despite these investments, relatively few protein biomarkers have achieved clinical validation largely due to naive data analysis strategies used in the protein quantification and statistical validation of candidate biomarkers. This project will develop a robust user- friendly software environment that builds upon state-of-the-art statistical algorithms that are focused on addressing the underlying proteome complexity associated with cancer.            ",Interactive Informatics Resource for Research-driven Cancer Proteomics,8685758,U01CA184783,"['Accounting ', ' Algorithms ', ' Biology ', ' Breast ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Data Reporting ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Environment ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Institutes ', ' Investments ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Mining ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Statistical Models ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Peptide Fingerprinting ', ' Peptide Mapping ', ' Peptides ', ' Phenotype ', ' Programming Languages ', ' Protein Modification ', ' Posttranslational Protein Processing ', ' Posttranslational Modifications ', ' Post-Translational Protein Modification ', ' Post-Translational Modifications ', ' Post-Translational Modification Protein/Amino Acid Biochemistry ', ' Post-Translational Protein Processing ', ' gene product ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Splicing ', ' RNA Splicing ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Specificity ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' statistics ', ' Technology ', ' Translating ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' cartilage link protein ', ' link protein ', ' information security ', ' Data awareness ', ' Data Security ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Visualization ', ' Imagery ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Ovarian ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Java ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' prognostic ', ' Training ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Data Quality ', ' Funding ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' Letters ', ' Staging ', ' Malignant Cell ', ' cancer cell ', ' tool ', ' instrument ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' experience ', ' user friendly computer software ', ' user friendly software ', ' Informatics ', ' novel ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Proteome ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Proteomics ', ' developing computer software ', ' develop software ', ' software development ', ' Genomics ', ' model design ', ' data processing ', ' computerized data processing ', ' protein expression ', ' Institution ', ' Protein Fragment ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' NIAID ', ' National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease ', ' NIDDK ', ' National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ', ' prognostic indicator ', ' prognostic biomarker ', ' Prognosis Marker ', ' Molecular Marker of Prognosis ', ' Prognostic Marker ', ' Resource Informatics ', ' Sum ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Collection ', ' Validation ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Source Code ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' data integration ', ' Advanced Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' graphic user interface ', ' Graphical interface ', ' graphical user interface ', ' cancer proteomics ', ' next generation diagnostics ', ' new diagnostics ', ' novel diagnostics ', ' prototype ', ' public health relevance ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' candidate validation ', ' Statistics Algorithm ', ' Statistical Algorithm ', ' mathematics methods ', ' mathematics methodology ', ' mathematics approach ', ' mathematical methodology ', ' mathematical approach ', ' math methods ', ' math methodology ', ' mathematical methods ', ' ']",NCI,BATTELLE PACIFIC NORTHWEST LABORATORIES,U01,2014,419855,WA-04,-0.03363817587415644

"Center for Environmental Genetics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)        It is a priority of the CEG and the Career Development Program to identify and develop the careers of promising early stage investigators. To accomplish this goal, the overall objective of the career development program (CDP) is to recruit, enrich, encourage, and provide resources and mentoring activities to investigators at the graduate, postgraduate and early faculty levels with a particular emphasis on environmental health science. The CDP has forged new cross-disciplinary partnerships in areas applicable to environmental health science with basic, epidemiological, and/or clinical studies including studies in molecular genetics and environmental epidemiology and environmental toxicology.  To accomplish the overall objective, the CDP has developed a highly innovative approach with three specific.  Aim 1 is to attract, recruit and promote opportunities for junior faculty (within three years from initial appointment) towards development of an independent career interfacing between basic, translational or clinical investigations with application to environmental health science. The Next Generation Biomedical Investigator (NGBI) program is the principal mechanism for achieving this aim.  Aim 2 is to identify investigators with less experience (novice investigators) who are still in trainin with minimal experience but have an interest in examining the intricate role of environmental health science in health and disease. Recruits include physicians in their academic fellowship i.e. post residency, who are obtaining an MS or Ph.D, mentored postdoctoral Ph.D. fellows or advanced (third or fourth year) pre-doctoral research students. This aim is achieved by supplementing novice investigators' training with research resources, mentoring and career development opportunities through the New Investigator Scholar (NIS) pathway.  Aim 3 is to enrich training/scientific experiences, promote career opportunities and networking experiences, activities integrated with the Administrative and other CEG cores. The objective is to develop NGBIs and NISs and others new to environmental health science by enriching experiences as an investigator and eventually independent scientist. Thus, these aims are achieved through financial awards, mentorship, access to core resources and other career development activities.                  Our environmental health center focuses on understanding how genes and environment affect our health,  serving the residents, communities of Ohio, the nation and the globe by generating knowledge that is  applicable to the general public and policymakers for healthier living.",Center for Environmental Genetics,8670743,P30ES006096,"['Affect ', ' Air ', ' Arteries ', ' Attention ', ' behavioral disorder ', ' Behavior Disorders ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Cells ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Environmental Health ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Equipment ', ' Evolution ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Human Genome Project ', ' Immunological Diseases ', ' Immunologic Diseases ', ' Immune System Disorder ', ' Immune Dysfunction ', ' Immune Disorders ', ' Immune Diseases ', ' Immune System Diseases ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Mission ', ' Neurology ', ' Ohio ', ' Phenotype ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Power Plants ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Transportation ', ' Identical Twins ', ' Monozygotic twins ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Variation (Genetics) ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' malignant endocrine gland tumor ', ' Malignant Endocrine Tumor ', ' Malignant Endocrine Neoplasm ', ' Endocrine Gland Cancer ', ' Endocrine Cancer ', ' malignant endocrine gland neoplasm ', ' lipid disorder ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Funding ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Staging ', ' environmental agent ', ' Nature ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Route ', ' experience ', ' environment effect on gene ', ' gene environment interaction ', ' health science research ', ' success ', ' Informatics ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' member ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Dose ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Core Facility ', ' Data ', ' Health Sciences ', ' NIH RFA ', ' Request for Applications ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Update ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Origin of Adult Disease ', ' Fetal Origin of Adult Disease ', ' Fetal Basis of Adult Disease ', ' FeBAD ', ' Barker Hypothesis ', ' whole-genome scan ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide scan ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome-wide scan ', ' genome-wide identification ', ' genome wide studies ', ' genome wide screen ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide analysis ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association study ', ' human capital ', ' endocrine disrupting ', ' Endocrine disruption ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' high risk ', ' clinical practice ', ' Allergic Disease ', ' epigenome ', ' ']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI,P30,2014,1739696,OH-01,0.04349464374307567
"NIDA Center of Excellence OF Computational Drug Abuse Research (CDAR) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose to establish a NIDA Center of Excellence for Computational Drug Abuse Research (CDAR) between the University of Pittsburgh (Pitt) and (CMU), with the goal of advancing and ensuring the productive and broad usage of state-of-the-art computational technologies that will facilitate and enhance drug abuse (DA) research, both in the local (Pittsburgh) area and nationwide.

"Reactome: An Open Knowledgebase of Human Pathways     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We seek renewal of the core operating funding for the Reactome Knowledgebase of Human Biological Pathways and Processes. Reactome is a curated knowledgebase available online as an open access resource that can be freely used and redistributed by all members of the biological research community. It is used by geneticists, genomics researchers, clinical researchers and molecular biologists to interpret the results of high-throughput experimental studies, by bioinformaticians seeking to develop novel algorithms for mining knowledge from genomics studies, and by systems biologists building predictive models of normal and abnormal pathways.  Our curational system draws heavily on the expertise of independent investigators within the community who author precise machine-readable descriptions of human biological pathways under the guidance of a staff of dedicated curators. Each pathway is extensively checked and peer-reviewed prior to publication to ensure its factual accuracy and compliance with the data model. A system of evidence tracking ensures that all assertions are backed up by the primary literature, and that human molecular events inferred from orthologous ones in animal models have an auditable inference chain. Curated pathways described by Reactome currently cover roughly one quarter of the translated portion of the genome. We also offer a network of ""functional interactions"" (FIs) predicted by a conservative machine-learning approach, that covers an additional quarter of the translated genome, for a combined coverage of roughly 50% of the known genome.  Over the next five years, we seek to (1) increase the number of curated proteins and other functional entities to at least 10,500; (2) to supplement normal pathways with variant reactions for 1200 genes representing disease states; (3) increase the size of the Reactome Fl network to 15,000 molecules; and (4) enhance the web site and other resources to meet the needs of a growing and diverse user community.

"Understanding the Mechanism of Social Network Influence in Health Outcomes throug     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Research in the design and implementation of the SMASH (Semantic Mining of Activity, Social, and Health data) system will address a critical need for data mining tools to help understanding the influence of healthcare social networks, such as YesiWell, on sustained weight loss where the data are multi-dimensional, temporal, semantically heterogeneous, and very sensitive. System design and implementation will rest on five specific aims. The first aim is to develop a novel data mining and statistical learning approach to understand key factors that enable spread of healthy behaviors in a social network (Aim 1). We propose to develop a formal and expressive Semantic Web ontology for the concepts used in describing the semantic features of healthcare data and social networks. We will then bridge the domain knowledge in healthcare and social networks with formal mappings across those ontological concepts (Aim 2). Next, we propose novel recommendation approaches building on top of the influence modeling and prediction. In addition, we will develop methods to utilize the recommendation as a means to better organize the social network such that the adoption of optimal health behaviors in the network can spread quickly and sustainably (Aim 3). To protect the privacy of human subjects during the data mining process for social network and health data, we consider the enforcement of differential privacy through a privacy preserving analysis layer. We will develop novel solutions to preserve differential privacy for mining dynamic health data and social activities of human subjects (Aim 4). To support this research, we will develop a web- accessible portal so that other researchers with little training i data mining will have shared access to data mining tools, ontologies, and social network analysis results (Aim 5). At the end of this project, data resources, tools, ontologies, and technologies will be made available to the larger research community.

"A Cyber-Informatics Approach to Studying Migration and Environmental Cancer Risk     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The World-Wide Web (Web 1.0) and online social media (Web 2.0) have revolutionized the ways medical knowledge is disseminated and health information is exchanged and shared among patients, supporters, and health care providers. Online patient communities have been expanding at an impressive rate with millions of active participants from all age groups. Recent studies on researching and analyzing social media contents for health-related applications show that this uprising cyber-trend leads to valuable knowledge, traditionally acquired with scientific methods such as observational epidemiological studies. This new mode for information acquisition is particularly advantageous for studies requiring long period of data curation. We propose to leverage the power of online contents, including user-generated contents on social network sites, to tackle NCI¿s second provocative question on complex migration patterns and their effect on environmental cancer risk. We hypothesize that the rich amount of personal information shared openly among cancer patients and cancer-free people online can be effectively mined to generate new knowledge on the topic, which cannot be easily uncovered with conventional migrant studies in our modern economy with population mobility patterns far more complex and dynamic than those observed in the past. To achieve our goal, we will build upon our unique cyber-informatics experience at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) on ultra-scale searching, identifying, and understanding free-structured web content. Specifically, we will develop domain-specific informatics tools to automatically reconstruct people's spatiotemporal lifelines, link them to spatiotemporal environmental data available from online sources such as the Environmental Protection Agency, and mine them using machine learning methods to search for salient associations between changes of migration-influenced environmental exposure and cancer risk. These tools will be individually validated and the overall approach will be carefully tested to understand its capabilities, methodological challenges, and practical limitations (if any) for knowledge discovery and scientific explorations in environmental cancer epidemiology. This study has the potential to provide a powerful complementary approach to the standard paradigm of observational epidemiological research. It will offer a fully automated and cost-effective way to discover new trends and monitor evolving ones on the impact of modern population migration patterns and environmental cancer risk. Such information could help cancer epidemiologists and health policy makers generate and prioritize study hypotheses worth testing with carefully controlled and properly powered (but also long term and costly) epidemiological studies.          Web mining has emerged in different domains as a powerful approach to harvesting knowledge of unprecedented quantity, comprehensiveness, and diversity. In this study we propose to pursue web mining in the environmental cancer risk domain. We will develop dedicated cyber-informatics algorithms and tools to (i) automatically search disparate online sources for retrieving and integrating contents related to individuals� cancer history and spatiotemporal environmental exposure profiles, and to (ii) effectively synthesize this information to accelerate knowledge discovery on environmental cancer risk change due to an individual's migration activities.

"INFORMATICS METHODS AND MODELS FOR COMPUTATIONAL PATHOLOGY  Abstract The applicant is an Assistant Professor at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School. The applicant's research program focuses on developing methods in translational bioinformatics to integrate heterogeneous biomedical data types (genomic, transcriptomic, microscopic, clinical) enabling the development of improved diagnostics and therapeutics for patients. Recent projects completed by the applicant include: the development of the Computational Pathology (C-Path) platform for building prognostic models from microscopic image data (Science Translational Medicine, 2011); and the development of the Significance Analysis of Prognostic Signatures method for identifying robust prognostic gene expression signatures form clinically annotated genomic data (PLoS Computational Biology, 2013). This K22 award will provide the applicant with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become an expert at designing and using ontologies to model Computational Pathology data and to support a Computational Pathology Knowledgebase; (2) to become an expert at integrative predictive modeling of Computational Pathology data, gene expression data, and clinical outcomes data; and (3) to develop and manage an independent research career in translational bioinformatics. To achieve these goals, the applicant has assembled a team of mentors and collaborators with expertise in each of these areas of translational biomedical informatics. The team includes: Dr Isaac Kohane, who is a Professor of Pediatrics, directs the Children's Hospital Informatics Program and leads an NLM-supported national center for biomedical computing; Dr Ron Kikinis who is a Professor at Harvard Medical School, and the Robert Greenes Distinguished Director of Biomedical Informatics in the Department of Radiology at Brigham and Women's Hospital; and Dr John Quackenbush, who is a Professor of Biostatistics and Computational Biology and Professor of Cancer Biology at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. During the K22 award program, the applicant and his study team will develop informatics models and methods for Computational Pathology data. In Aim 1, they will develop a Computational Pathology Ontology to support a Computational Pathology Knowledgebase. The knowledgebase will be populated with microscopic phenotype data, gene expression data, and clinical outcomes data from over 2,500 cancer patients that underwent molecular profiling as part of The Cancer Genome Atlas project. In Specific Aim 2, they will develop and apply methods in machine learning to identify associations between gene expression and microscopic phenotypes. This information will be incorporated into the C-Path Knowledgebase. In Aim 3, they will use the C-Path Knowledgebase to build integrative prognostic models that jointly model quantitative morphological data and quantitative gene expression data to predict patient survival. The integrative prognostic models generated in breast, brain, kidney, and lung cancer will lead to more effective diagnostics for these malignancies. The central hypothesis for this application is that morphological and molecular data are inherently complementary, and the most biologically informative and clinically useful predictive models will incorporate information from both of these heterogeneous data types. This research will form the basis for an R01 application to further develop and validate the informatics methods and models developed in this project.  Project Narrative: This project will develop new computational methods for modeling quantitative microscopic phenotype data and for integrating microscopic disease phenotypes with gene expression data and clinical outcomes data. These advances will lead to the development of improved diagnostics for patients, allowing clinicians to more accurately predict the outcome of a patient's disease, leading to more effective individualized therapies.",INFORMATICS METHODS AND MODELS FOR COMPUTATIONAL PATHOLOGY,8674406,K22LM011931,"['Algorithms ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hospitals ', "" Children's Hospital "", ' Pediatric Hospitals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Israel ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Lung ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Pediatrics ', ' Phenotype ', ' Radiology ', ' General Radiology ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' Research ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Science ', ' backbone ', ' Spine ', ' Spinal Column ', ' Vertebral column ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Brain ', ' Brain Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of brain ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Microscopic ', ' Link ', ' prognostic ', ' insight ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Malignant Cell ', ' cancer cell ', ' Pathologist ', ' Diagnostic ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Computational Biology ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Medical center ', ' professor ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' Informatics ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Genomics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Renal Cancer ', ' Kidney Carcinoma ', ' Kidney Cancer ', ' Renal carcinoma ', ' biomedical computation ', ' Biomedical Computing ', ' DF/HCC ', ' Dana-Farber Cancer Institute ', ' Data ', ' molecular signature ', ' molecular profile ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' Expression Signature ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' Cancer Biology ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Clinical Data ', ' trial treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' Collection ', ' Gene Expression Alteration ', ' K22 Award ', ' Ontology ', ' Tissue Chip ', ' Tissue Arrays ', ' Tissue Microarray ', ' Validation ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' transcriptome ', ' gene expression signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' disease phenotype ', ' biomed informatics ', ' biomedical informatics ', ' cancer gene expression ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' cancer type ', ' transcriptomics ', ' translational medicine ', ' multi-task ', ' multitask ', ' clinical care ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' TCGA ', ' The Cancer Genome Atlas ', ' ']",NLM,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,K22,2014,170586,MA-07,-0.0006821660684180556
"Bioinformatics Strategies for Multidimensional Brain Imaging Genetics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Today's generation of multi-modal imaging systems produces massive high dimensional data sets, which when coupled with high throughput genotyping data such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), provide exciting opportunities to enhance our understanding of phenotypic characteristics and the genetic architecture of human diseases. However, the unprecedented scale and complexity of these data sets have presented critical computational bottlenecks requiring new concepts and enabling tools. To address these challenges, using the study of Alzheimer's disease (AD) as a test bed, this project will develop and validate novel bioinformatics strategies for multidimensional brain imaging genetics. Aim 1 is to develop a novel bi- multivariate analysis strategy, S3K-CCA, for studying imaging genetic associations. Existing imaging genetics methods are typically designed to discover single-SNP-single-QT, single-SNP-multi-QT or multi-SNP-single- QT associations, and have limited power in revealing complex relationships between interlinked genetic markers and correlated brain phenotypes. To overcome this limitation, S3K-CCA is designed to be a sparse bi- multivariate learning model that simultaneously uses multiple response variables with multiple predictors for analyzing large-scale multi-modal neurogenomic data. Aim 2 is to develop HD-BIG, a visualization and systems biology framework for integrative analysis of High-Dimensional Brain Imaging Genetics data. Machine learning strategies to seamlessly incorporate valuable domain knowledge to produce biologically meaningful results is still an under-explored area in imaging genetics. In this aim, we will develop a user-friendly heat map interface to visualize high-dimensional results, adjust learning parameters and strategies, interact with existing bioinformatics resources and tools, and facilitate visual exploratory and systems biology analysis. A novel imaging genetic enrichment analysis (IGEA) method will be developed to identify relevant genetic pathways and associated brain circuits, and to reveal complex relationships among them. Aim 3 is to evaluate the proposed S3K-CCA and IGEA methods and the HD-BIG framework using both simulated and real imaging genetics data. This project is expected to produce novel bioinformatics algorithms and tools for comprehensive joint analysis of large scale heterogeneous imaging genetics data. The availability of these powerful methods is critical to the success of many imaging genetics initiatives. In addition, they can also help enable new computational applications in other areas of biomedical research where systematic and integrative analysis of large-scale multi-modal data is critical. Using AD as an exemplar, the proposed methods will demonstrate the potential for enhancing mechanistic understanding of complex disorders, which can benefit public health outcomes by facilitating diagnostic and therapeutic progress.             Public Health Relevance (Narrative) Recent advances in multi-modal imaging and high throughput genotyping techniques provide exciting opportunities to enhance our understanding of phenotypic characteristics and underlying genetic mechanisms associated with human diseases.

"The HMS Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology PROJECT SUMMARY  Systems and computational biologists, physician-scientists, pharmacologists, biochemists and cell biologists will collaborate in a new Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology (LSP) to apply a measure-model approach to understanding the mechanisms of action of therapeutic drugs in multiple disease areas. The LSP will pioneer the development of quantitative network-centric approaches to pharmacology and toxicology that include analysis of dose-time-response relationships at a single-cell level, modeling of cellular network dynamics and their perturbation by drugs, development of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic models in mouse and ultimately in man and use of systematic approaches to identify and qualify new drug targets. Our approach combines mathematical modeling with empirical measurement (including work with clinical samples and data) and aims to create quantitative and predictive drug response models at different temporal and physical scales. We aim to reinvigorate pharmacology and toxicology as foundational disciplines of translational medicine, develop the conceptual underpinning for personalized and precision medicine and lower the cost of drug discovery by improving its predictability. Close interactions with industry and the FDA will help address the productivity gap in drug discovery and development. The LSP is innovative with respect to its goal of using problems in basic and translational pharmacology to link three disciplines (cell and molecular biology, computational biology and medicine) and its aim of advancing therapeutic science in the Boston area and beyond. Students and postdocs supervised by 18 faculty members, 2 independent postdoctoral fellows and two PhD-level staff from 7 institutions will work in immediate proximity in a new custom-designed laboratory. The lab will host a new graduate program in therapeutics and multi-factored outreach activities that will promote systems pharmacology internationally.  These goals will be achieved through four inter-linked research programs (Aims 1-4), a core dedicated to efficient translation of LSP research (Aim 5), an education core and administrative/outreach activities (Aims 6-8). Aim 1 will focus on the determinants of dose-response at a single-cell level, including the role of cell-to-cell variability in fractional response and of timing and order-of-exposure in combination therapy. Aim 2 will take a network-level approach to understanding therapeutic, toxic and paradoxical drug responses by kinase inhibitors in three types of cancer. The mechanistic basis and consequences of poly-pharmacology will also be examined along with differential drug responsiveness by normal and diseased tissues. Aim 3 will address PK-PD by developing multi-scale models of drug actions at the level of cells, tissues and organisms and new methods for measuring drug distribution at the cellular and subcellular levels. Aim 4 will apply machine learning and causal reasoning to target discovery from clinical records in asthma, inflammatory disease and fibrosis and pursue a structure-guided approach to identifying regulators of ""undruggable "" targets. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The computational biologists, physician-scientists and pharmacologists in the Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology will apply a combined measure-model approach to understanding the mechanisms of action of therapeutic drugs in multiple disease areas. They will develop and apply new tools to (i) investigate the factors that determine the therapeutic index of drugs at a single cell level and in tissues (ii) apply knowledge of cellulr networks to develop a rational approach to combination therapy (iii) identify and qualify new drug targets for significant unmet medical needs. Success with our approach will advance personalized medicine and reduce the frequency of late-stage failure in drug discovery, thereby reducing the cost of new medicines.",The HMS Laboratory of

"Next generation risk variant discovery in a highly penetrant OCD subtype    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed five-year K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award outlines a program of career development and research activities that will assist the principal investigator to transition to an independent research career and prepare her to tackle the challenges ahead in unraveling the genetic basis of complex psychiatric phenotypes. The innovative research plan details an approach to mapping risk for a strongly genetic subtype of obsessive compulsive (OCD) and comorbid tic disorders by generating and analyzing whole-exome sequence in select families to identify risk alleles. These efforts will be guided by pilot identity-by-descent, homozygosity, and copy number variant data in the comprehensively phenotyped OCD Collaborative Genetic Study (OCGS) multiplex family dataset. The OCD+tic phenotype is an ideal complex disorder for next generation genetic mapping. The clear phenotype, possibly reduced heterogeneity, and strong genetic effects make it an excellent candidate for the application of methodologies recently proven successful in Mendelian disorders. While the principle investigator has a strong background in child psychiatry and molecular genetics, the knowledge and skills required to master emerging genetic technologies such as next generation sequencing (NGS) are novel and complex. The short-term goals of this application are to gain proficiency in the methods that will drive the field over the coming decades, learn the statistical, computational, and informatics tools that will support this research, continue to develop skills in study design and interpretation, and refine and incorporate clinical and phenotyping skills. A program of coursework, supervision, and hands-on application of these approaches will equip the applicant in the long-term to integrate molecular, computational, and phenotypic data to make meaningful contributions to the field of psychiatric genetics. This award will help the candidate to establish an independent research career, position herself on the front of these new advances, and bring the lessons learned to the field of child psychiatry.

"Multimodal Biomarkers in Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K01 award will support my development as an independent investigator with a translational research program that specializes in the cognitive and biological basis of neurodegenerative diseases such as frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Candidate: My research experience as a cognitive neuroscientist ideally positions me to achieve my career goal of becoming an independent investigator with expertise on the cognitive and biological basis of neurodegenerative disease. I have strong cognitive training with an M.Sc in Psycholinguistics and Ph.D in Psychology from the University of Edinburgh, where I was supported by an NRSA Individual Predoctoral Award. During my postdoctoral IGERT fellowship at the Institute for Research in Cognitive Science at the University of Pennsylvania, I was awarded an NRSA Individual Postdoctoral Fellowship Award to investigate the role of decision-making in language. In this research I have gained experience investigating neurodegenerative disease patients comparatively in order to obtain converging evidence to complement fMRI studies of healthy adults. I have become increasingly interested in translating my research to optimize the diagnosis and treatment of patients with neurodegenerative diseases. I was recently award the Society for the Neurobiology of Language Postdoctoral Merit Award in recognition of my novel research investigating how social limitations in patients contribute to difficulty in discourse. I have committed to four years of clinical research the NIH Loan Repayment Program, and I intend to commit to clinical research for the duration of my career. I have learned that cognitive and neuroimaging studies provide only one perspective on neurodegenerative diseases. In this proposal, I plan to gain the necessary expertise in biological aspects of FTLD and related conditions to complement my past experiences, and thus achieve my goal of becoming a multifaceted independent investigator with expertise in the cognitive and biological basis for neurodegenerative diseases. With the support of this K01, I will develop expertise to conduct investigations of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), genetic, and neuropathological aspects of neurodegenerative diseases. I will ultimately integrate the biological expertise gained in this proposal with language studies from my cognitive neuroscience research in an effort to identify non-invasive biomarkers that can be used to screen patients for clinical trials and to measure the efficacy of disease-modifying agents. Environment: This award will be conducted at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in the Department of Neurology, the Center for Neurodegenerative Disease Research (CNDR), and the Penn Bioinformatics Center where I have strong institutional support. The proposed institution is an exceptional environment that has expert centers for neuroimaging, cerebrospinal fluid biomarker analysis, a leading genetic research core, expert neuropathology, outstanding biostatisical support, and relevant clinical research laboratories. The University of Pennsylvania is unique in comparison to other institutions in the country because all of the above methods are available in one center. My mentor, Dr. Murray Grossman, and my co-mentor, Dr. John Trojanowksi, have international reputations for neurodegenerative disease research. My career development will also be supported by my co-mentor, Dr. Lyle Ungar, who has extensive expertise in statistical learning algorithms and in the analysis of proteomic and genomics datasets. Together, this mentorship team will facilitate my development as an independent investigator by providing access to existing and future collaborators, laboratory resources, and exceptional training environments. The CNDR is a world- leading center for neurodegenerative disease research with human and animal models of disease and exceptional translational science. Biofluid biomarker experience is extensive, and several national biofluid cores are centered at Penn (e.g. ADNI). There is a wealth of internationally-recognized neuroimaging expertise at the University of Pennsylvania in the Penn Imaging and Computer Science Laboratory, and I will benefit by integrating neuroimaging resources from these facilities with other modalities of biomarker research. Training: I will develop my expertise in the biological basis of neurodegenerative disease with the support of my mentor, Dr. Murray Grossman, and my co-mentors, Dr. John Trojanowski and Dr. Lyle Ungar. Specifically, with Dr. Trojanowksi I will engage in training related to biofluid and genetic biomarkers of FTLD. I will develop advanced neuroimaging skills and cutting-edge biostatistical methods with Dr. Ungar. Each of these training modalities will be supported by complementary formal coursework, participation in seminars, attendance of conferences, and regularly scheduled meetings with mentorship team. Research: FTLD is a neurodegenerative disease affecting approximately 15 out of 100,000 individuals. In recent years detailed neuropathological investigations at autopsy have demonstrated distinct sources of histopathological abnormalities in FTLD, including the presence of tau inclusions (FTLD-tau) and TDP-43 proteinopathies (FTLD-TDP). However, there are currently no in vivo methods for discriminating between FTLD-tau and FTLD-TDP. There is an urgent need to improve the in vivo diagnosis of FTLD to appropriately enter patients into emerging clinical trials, and to develop sensitive and specific endpoints in trials that can quantify response to these treatments. The overall research aim of this proposal is to develop multimodal methods to improve in vivo diagnosis of FTLD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) affects approximately 15 out of 100,000 adults. Detailed neuropathological investigations at autopsy have identified two distinct sources of histopathological changes that contribute to FTLD. However, there are currently no in vivo methods for diagnosing pathological subtypes of FTLD. There is an urgent need to identify in vivo diagnosis methods to facilitate the identification of appropriate patients to enter into emerging disease-modifying drug treatment trials. The overall aim of this project is to identify multimodal biomarkers of FTLD.",Multimodal Biomarkers in Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration,8849803,K01AG043503,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', '

"Pharmaco Response Signatures and Disease Mechanism DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the HMS LINCS Center is to delineate the fundamental principles of cellular response to perturbagens at the level of single-cells and cell populations and to make response data routinely available via web-based browse, query and programmatic interfaces. This will involve the development and testing of new measurement methods, computational algorithms, and response signatures for diverse human cell types exposed to perturbations individually and in combination. We will emphasize the systematic collection of data not currently available in existing public databases including live and fixed-cell imaging, biochemical data on signaling proteins and multi-factorial drug-response phenotypes. A focus on diverse transformed and primary cells, including those derived from healthy and diseased donors, and on clinical grade small molecules (kinase inhibitors and epigenome drugs) will increase the translational impact of our work. The proposed LINCS Center represents a continuation of a program in operation for ~3.5 years under a LINCS pilot phase U54 award. We will expand the scope and sophistication of our Center, devoting  significant effort to (i) improving the quality of data analysis and visualization, particularly wih respect to the  complexities of perturbagen polypharmacy (ii) accelerating the release of perturbagen-response signatures  using methods that have been demonstrated to yield reliable and informative data, with a particular  emphasis on primary and non-transformed cells (iii) developing and applying new measurement methods,  particularly mass spectrometry for analysis of cell populations and live-cell imaging for analysis of single cells.  The work will involve nine complementary but independent aims. In Data Generation, Aim 1 will perform systematic analysis of perturbagen responses at a single-cell level. Aim 2 will collect multiplex protein and mRNA data on perturbagen response using a set of complementary imaging, mass spectrometry and bead-based assays. Aim 3 will apply LINCS methods to non-transformed immune cells and induced pluripotent stem cells, and explore if signatures can guide a detailed medicinal chemistry campaign. In Data Analysis, Aim 4 will construct perturbagen-response signatures using statistical modeling, network inference and machine learning methods. Aim 5 will develop new approaches to understanding and analyzing drug interactions on multiple phenotypes in single cells. Aim 6 will develop a novel compressed sensing framework for analyzing the poly-pharmacology of kinase inhibitors. Aim 7 will enhance the query, browse and explore functions of the HMS LINCS website and database and its integration with the UCSC Genome Browser. In Community Interaction and Outreach, Aim 8 will implement diverse training and outreach activities, including collaboration with LINCS and non-LINCS research groups. In Administration, Aim 9 will ensure effective management of the Center, sustained access to tools and data produced within the LINCS Project, and compliance with program goals. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Disease networks are complex interactions between multiple proteins. Precise understanding of the multifactorial perturbations imposed on multi-component networks is a crucial step in the development of a rational approach to drug discovery and personalization of therapy.

"Statistical Modeling of Complex Traits in Genetic Reference Super-Populations DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Genetic crosses in model organisms play an essential role in understanding the heritable architecture of medically relevant phenotypes. Traditionally, such crosses have tended to be on a small scale with either limited power to detect genetic effects or limited resolution to localize causal variants. Recently, however, the emergence of larger-scale interdisciplinary research, cheaper genotyping and parallel advances in human genetics, have spurred the development of more sophisticated and powerful experimental designs. Genetic Resource Populations (GRPs) use economies of scale to provide cost-effective and replicable platforms for genetic studies. This project concerns the largest, most ambitious GRP in mouse genetics to date, the Collaborative Cross (CC), and a series of crosses and designs related to or derived from it: the Diversity Outbred (DO) cross, the CC Recombinant Inbred Cross (CC-RIX) and the diallel. Experiments on each separate cross provide distinct information about the heritable architecture of a target complex disease. In combination, this Genetic Reference Super-Population (GRSP) potentially provides an unparalleled basis for cross-study replication and integration in mouse genetics. This project aims to develop statistical methods that advance the current state of complex trait analysis of these populations separately, and, by exploiting the unique structure that connects them, proposes to develop a statistical framework that allows for their joint use.  Aim 1 develops a Bayesian probabilistic framework for haplotype-based analysis of quantitative trait loci (QTL). Aim 1a develops a statistical software module for flexible haplotype-based analysis, which can be ex- tended by the researcher to model a rich variety of designs and disease types. Aim 1b will adapt machine learning techniques to provide posterior inference of the allelic series of a QTL. Aim 1c will incorporate Bayesian modeling of polygenic effects.  Aim 2 and 3 concern joint analysis, building on the foundation set by Aim 1. Aim 2 develops methods to optimize experimental design of follow-up studies in one population given results from another. Aim 2a uses the diallel to inform design of CC/CC-RIX/DO experiments. Aim 2b uses partial data on CC/CC-RIX/DO to guide collection of additional data. Aim 3 explores models for jointly analyzing multiple populations in the GRSP, using complementary datasets to stabilize analysis at single QTL (Aim 3a) and across multiple QTL (Aim 3b).  These aims address specific and persistent challenges in the cost-effective design and efficient analysis of multiparent genetic data, in particular the CC, DO, CC-RIX and diallel. The project will generate tools useful for a wide range of model organism crosses and can be applied to the genetic study of any complex disease. The proposed research will lead to improvements in the analysis and design of genetic studies on animal models of human disease. Because the project focuses on statistical methodology applied to experimental mouse populations, the scientific output of the project is expected to be applicable to basic research focusing on any medical condition that can be studied in the mouse.",Statistical Modeling of Complex Traits in Genetic Reference Super-Populations,8919917,R01GM104125,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Anxiety ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Architecture ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Genetic Crosses ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Foundations ', ' Genotype ', ' Haplotypes ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Human Genetics ', ' Hybrids ', ' Inbreeding ', ' Influentials ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Technology ', ' Weight ', ' Generations ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' insight ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Funding ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' QTL ', ' Quantitative Trait Loci ', ' success ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' Animal Model ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' genetic resource ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Population Analysis ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Recombinants ', ' Resolution ', ' Collection ', ' Genetic Algorithm ', ' Genetic Programming ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Output ', ' disease phenotype ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' Coupled ', ' Plug-in ', ' human disease ', ' population based ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' Bayesian tracking algorithms ', ' Bayesian statistical models ', ' Bayesian spatial models ', ' Bayesian spatial image models ', ' Bayesian spatial data model ', ' Bayesian nonparametric models ', ' Bayesian network model ', ' Bayesian hierarchical model ', ' Bayesian framework ', ' Bayesian belief updating model ', ' Bayesian belief network ', ' Bayesian adaptive models ', ' Bayesian adaptive designs ', ' Bayesian Modeling ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2015,241086,NC-04,-0.014759678335424749

"Understanding the Mechanism of Social Network Influence in Health Outcomes throug DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Research in the design and implementation of the SMASH (Semantic Mining of Activity, Social, and Health data) system will address a critical need for data mining tools to help understanding the influence of healthcare social networks, such as YesiWell, on sustained weight loss where the data are multi-dimensional, temporal, semantically heterogeneous, and very sensitive. System design and implementation will rest on five specific aims. The first aim is to develop a novel data mining and statistical learning approach to understand key factors that enable spread of healthy behaviors in a social network (Aim 1). We propose to develop a formal and expressive Semantic Web ontology for the concepts used in describing the semantic features of healthcare data and social networks. We will then bridge the domain knowledge in healthcare and social networks with formal mappings across those ontological concepts (Aim 2). Next, we propose novel recommendation approaches building on top of the influence modeling and prediction. In addition, we will develop methods to utilize the recommendation as a means to better organize the social network such that the adoption of optimal health behaviors in the network can spread quickly and sustainably (Aim 3). To protect the privacy of human subjects during the data mining process for social network and health data, we consider the enforcement of differential privacy through a privacy preserving analysis layer. We will develop novel solutions to preserve differential privacy for mining dynamic health data and social activities of human subjects (Aim 4). To support this research, we will develop a web- accessible portal so that other researchers with little training i data mining will have shared access to data mining tools, ontologies, and social network analysis results (Aim 5). At the end of this project, data resources, tools, ontologies, and technologies will be made available to the larger research community. This work is an inter-disciplinary collaboration among the PI, Dejing Dou, Co-I Daniel Lowd, both experts in data mining and machine learning, and Jessica Greene, an expert in health policy, at the University of Oregon, Brigitte Piniewski MD, the lead of YesiWell, at PeaceHealth Laboratories, Ruoming Jin, an expert in complex network mining, at Kent State University, Xintao Wu, an expert in privacy preserving mining, at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, David Kil, the previous Chief Scientist at SKT Americas and program manager of YesiWell, and the founder of HealthMantic, and Junfeng Sun, a mathematical statistician at the NIH and an expert in design of clinical trials.

"INFORMATICS METHODS AND MODELS FOR COMPUTATIONAL PATHOLOGY DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The applicant is an Assistant Professor at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School.  The applicant's research program focuses on developing methods in translational bioinformatics to integrate heterogeneous biomedical data types (genomic, transcriptomic, microscopic, clinical) enabling the development of improved diagnostics and therapeutics for patients. Recent projects completed by the applicant include: the development of the Computational Pathology (C-Path) platform for building prognostic models from microscopic image data (Science Translational Medicine, 2011); and the development of the Significance Analysis of Prognostic Signatures method for identifying robust prognostic gene expression signatures form clinically annotated genomic data (PLoS Computational Biology, 2013).     This K22 award will provide the applicant with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become an expert at designing and using ontologies to model Computational Pathology data and to support a Computational Pathology Knowledgebase; (2) to become an expert at integrative predictive modeling of Computational Pathology data, gene expression data, and clinical outcomes data; and (3) to develop and manage an independent research career in translational bioinformatics. To achieve these goals, the applicant has assembled a team of mentors and collaborators with expertise in each of these areas of translational biomedical informatics. The team includes: Dr. Isaac Kohane, who is a Professor of Pediatrics, directs the Children's Hospital Informatics Program and leads an NLM-supported national center for biomedical computing; Dr. Ron Kikinis who is a Professor at Harvard Medical School, and the Robert Greenes Distinguished Director of Biomedical Informatics in the Department of Radiology at Brigham and Women's Hospital; and Dr. John Quackenbush, who is a Professor of Biostatistics and Computational Biology and Professor of Cancer Biology at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.     During the K22 award program, the applicant and his study team will develop informatics models and methods for Computational Pathology data. In Aim 1, they will develop a Computational Pathology Ontology to support a Computational Pathology Knowledgebase. The knowledgebase will be populated with microscopic phenotype data, gene expression data, and clinical outcomes data from over 2,500 cancer patients that underwent molecular profiling as part of The Cancer Genome Atlas project. In Specific Aim 2, they will develop and apply methods in machine learning to identify associations between gene expression and microscopic phenotypes. This information will be incorporated into the C-Path Knowledgebase. In Aim 3, they will use the C-Path Knowledgebase to build integrative prognostic models that jointly model quantitative morphological data and quantitative gene expression data to predict patient survival. The integrative prognostic models generated in breast, brain, kidney, and lung cancer will lead to more effective diagnostics for these malignancies.     The central hypothesis for this application is that morphological and molecular data are inherently complementary, and the most biologically informative and clinically useful predictive models will incorporate information from both of these heterogeneous data types. This research will form the basis for an R01 application to further develop and validate the informatics methods and models developed in this project. Project Narrative: This project will develop new computational methods for modeling quantitative microscopic phenotype data and for integrating microscopic disease phenotypes with gene expression data and clinical outcomes data. These advances will lead to the development of improved diagnostics for patients, allowing clinicians to more accurately predict the outcome of a patient's disease, leading to more effective individualized therapies.",INFORMATICS METHODS AND MODELS FOR COMPUTATIONAL PATHOLOGY,8887236,K22LM011931,"['Algorithms ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hospitals ', "" Children's Hospital "", ' Pediatric Hospitals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Israel ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Lung ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Pediatrics ', ' Phenotype ', ' Radiology ', ' General Radiology ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' Research ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Science ', ' backbone ', ' Spine ', ' Spinal Column ', ' Vertebral column ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Brain ', ' Brain Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of brain ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Microscopic ', ' Link ', ' prognostic ', ' insight ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Malignant Cell ', ' cancer cell ', ' Pathologist ', ' Diagnostic ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Computational Biology ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Medical center ', ' professor ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' Informatics ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Genomics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Renal Cancer ', ' Kidney Carcinoma ', ' Kidney Cancer ', ' Renal carcinoma ', ' biomedical computation ', ' Biomedical Computing ', ' DF/HCC ', ' Dana-Farber Cancer Institute ', ' Data ', ' molecular signature ', ' molecular profile ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' Expression Signature ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' Cancer Biology ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Clinical Data ', ' trial treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' Collection ', ' Gene Expression Alteration ', ' K22 Award ', ' Ontology ', ' Tissue Chip ', ' Tissue Arrays ', ' Tissue Microarray ', ' Validation ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' transcriptome ', ' gene expression signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' disease phenotype ', ' biomed informatics ', ' biomedical informatics ', ' cancer gene expression ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' cancer type ', ' transcriptomics ', ' translational medicine ', ' multi-task ', ' multitask ', ' clinical care ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' TCGA ', ' The Cancer Genome Atlas ', ' precision medicine ', ' ']",NLM,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,K22,2015,151992,MA-07,-0.0006821660684180556
"Integration and Visualization of Diverse Biological Data ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The onset of most human disease involves multiple, molecular-level changes to the complex system of interacting genes and pathways that function differently in specific cell-lineage, pathway and treatment contexts. While this system has been probed by the thousands of functional genomics and quantitative genetic studies, careful extraction of signals relevant to these specific contexts is a challenging problem. General integration of these heterogeneous data was an important first step in detecting signals that be used to build networks to generate experimentally-testable hypotheses. However, only by dealing with the fact that disease happens at the intersection of multiple contexts and by integrating functional genomics with quantitative genetics will we be able to move toward a molecular-level understanding of human pathophysiology, which will pave the way to new therapy and drug development.  The long-term goal of this project is to enable such discoveries through the development of innovative bioinformatics frameworks for integrative analysis of diverse functional genomic data. In the previous funding periods, we developed accurate data integration and visualization methodologies for most common model organisms and human, created methods for tissue-specific data analysis, and applied these methods to make novel insights about important biological processes. We further enabled experimental biological discovery by implementing these methods in publicly accessible interactive systems that are popular with experimental biologists.  Leveraging our prior work, we now will directly address the challenge of enabling data-driven study of molecular mechanisms underlying human disease by developing novel semi-supervised and multi-task machine learning approaches and implementing them in a real-time integration system capable of predicting genome-scale functional and mechanism-specific networks focused on any biological context of interest. This will allow any biomedical researcher to quickly make data-driven hypotheses about function, interactions, and regulation of genes involved in hypertension in the kidney glomerulus or to predict new regulatory interactions relevant to Parkinson's disease that affect the ubiquitination pathway in Substantia nigra. Furthermore, we will develop methods for disease gene discovery that leverage these highly specific networks for functional analysis of quantitative genetics data. Our deliverable will be a general, robust, user-friendly, and automatically updated system for user-driven functional genomic data integration and functional analysis of quantitative genetics data. Throughout this work, we (with our close experimental and clinical collaborators) will also apply our methods to chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease/hypertension, and autism spectrum disorders both as case studies for the iterative improvement of our methods and to make direct contribution to better understanding of these diseases.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will create a web-accessible system that will enable biologists and clinicians to generate hypotheses regarding disease-linked genes, molecular mechanisms underlying genetic disorders, and drug discovery for more targeted treatment. Underlying this user-friendly web interface will be novel algorithms for on-the-fly integration of  vast amount of functional genomics and quantitative genetics data based on the context(s) defined by the biologist or clinician. As applied to the three case study areas, chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease/hypertension, and autism spectrum disorders, our system has the potential to identify novel disease genes and pathways and to enable development of better diagnostic biomarkers, drug targets, and, in the longer term, treatments.            ",Integration and Visualization of Diverse Biological Data,8886554,R01GM071966,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' computing system ', ' Computer Systems ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Feedback ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Au element ', ' Gold ', ' hereditary disorder ', ' genetic disorder ', ' Molecular Disease ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' Genetic Condition ', ' Hereditary Disease ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' renal glomerulus ', ' Malpighian Tuft ', ' Kidney Glomerulus ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Nephrology ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Parkinsons disease ', "" Parkinson's disease "", "" Parkinson's "", ' Parkinson ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Lewy Body Parkinson Disease ', ' Idiopathic Parkinson Disease ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Real-Time Systems ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Substantia Nigra ', ' Substantia nigra structure ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' case report ', ' Case Study ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Visualization ', ' Imagery ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Systems Integration ', ' Funding ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Collaborations ', ' Letters ', ' Cell Lineage ', ' Diagnostic ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' Animal Model ', ' novel ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Modeling ', ' drug development ', ' Genetic Information Databases ', ' Genetic Databanks ', ' Genetic Data Bases ', ' Genetic Data Banks ', ' Genetic Databases ', ' functional genomics ', ' drug discovery ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Address ', ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' Quantitative Genetics ', ' ubiquitin conjugation ', ' ubiquination ', ' Ubiquitinoylation ', ' Ubiquitilation ', ' Ubiquitination ', ' Update ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' whole-genome scan ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide scan ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome-wide scan ', ' genome-wide identification ', ' genome wide studies ', ' genome wide screen ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide analysis ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association study ', ' data integration ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' user-friendly ', ' web interface ', ' web-accessible ', ' Network-based ', ' multi-task ', ' multitask ', ' human disease ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' discover genes ', ' gene discovery ', ' public health relevance ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' genomewide ', ' genome-wide ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' ']",NIGMS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,473642,NJ-12,-0.03120702439740665
"A Cyber-Informatics Approach to Studying Migration and Environmental Cancer Risk DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The World-Wide Web (Web 1.0) and online social media (Web 2.0) have revolutionized the ways medical knowledge is disseminated and health information is exchanged and shared among patients, supporters, and health care providers. Online patient communities have been expanding at an impressive rate with millions of active participants from all age groups. Recent studies on researching and analyzing social media contents for health-related applications show that this uprising cyber-trend leads to valuable knowledge, traditionally acquired with scientific methods such as observational epidemiological studies. This new mode for information acquisition is particularly advantageous for studies requiring long period of data curation. We propose to leverage the power of online contents, including user-generated contents on social network sites, to tackle NCI's second provocative question on complex migration patterns and their effect on environmental cancer risk. We hypothesize that the rich amount of personal information shared openly among cancer patients and cancer-free people online can be effectively mined to generate new knowledge on the topic, which cannot be easily uncovered with conventional migrant studies in our modern economy with population mobility patterns far more complex and dynamic than those observed in the past. To achieve our goal, we will build upon our unique cyber-informatics experience at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) on ultra-scale searching, identifying, and understanding free-structured web content. Specifically, we will develop domain-specific informatics tools to automatically reconstruct people's spatiotemporal lifelines, link them to spatiotemporal environmental data available from online sources such as the Environmental Protection Agency, and mine them using machine learning methods to search for salient associations between changes of migration-influenced environmental exposure and cancer risk. These tools will be individually validated and the overall approach will be carefully tested to understand its capabilities, methodological challenges, and practical limitations (if any) for knowledge discovery and scientific explorations in environmental cancer epidemiology. This study has the potential to provide a powerful complementary approach to the standard paradigm of observational epidemiological research. It will offer a fully automated and cost-effective way to discover new trends and monitor evolving ones on the impact of modern population migration patterns and environmental cancer risk. Such information could help cancer epidemiologists and health policy makers generate and prioritize study hypotheses worth testing with carefully controlled and properly powered (but also long term and costly) epidemiological studies. Web mining has emerged in different domains as a powerful approach to harvesting knowledge of unprecedented quantity, comprehensiveness, and diversity. In this study we propose to pursue web mining in the environmental cancer risk domain. We will develop dedicated cyber-informatics algorithms and tools to (i) automatically search disparate online sources for retrieving and integrating contents related to individuals' cancer history and spatiotemporal environmental exposure profiles, and to (ii) effectively synthesize this information to accelerate knowledge discovery on environmental cancer risk change due to an individual's migration activities.",A Cyber-Informatics Approach to Studying Migration and Environmental Cancer Risk,8876609,R01CA170508,"['Algorithms ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' Incidence ', ' Laboratories ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Migrant ', ' Nomads ', ' Mining ', ' Mission ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Environmental Protection Agency ', ' United States Environmental Protection Agency ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Individual ', ' Policy Maker ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' Personal Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Personal Medical History ', ' Medical History ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' environmental carcinogenesis ', ' meetings ', ' age group ', ' cancer risk ', ' experience ', ' Informatics ', ' high-end computing ', ' High Performance Computing ', ' population migration ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer therapy ', ' Environmental Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Environmental Cancer ', ' Environment-Related Malignant Neoplasm ', ' environment related cancer ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' cancer epidemiology ', ' Data ', ' Harvest ', ' Individual Cancer History ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' migration ', ' data acquisition ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' social networking web site ', ' social networking site ', ' social networking website ', ' internet security ', ' cybersecurity ', ' cyber security ', ' Knowledge Discovery ', ' ']",NCI,"UT-BATTELLE, LLC-OAK RIDGE NATIONAL LAB",R01,2015,392385,TN-03,0.0025362668501212483

"Integrated Public Use Microdata Series: North Atlantic Population Project    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Research teams in the United States, Britain, Canada, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden have worked in close coordination to create the North Atlantic Population Project (NAPP), a massive integrated cross-national microdatabase that provides a baseline for studies of demographic change and opens fresh paths for spatiotemporal data analysis. We now propose improvements that will multiply the power of the NAPP infrastructure. We have three major aims: (1) Triple the size of the database to approximately 365 million records, adding 40 new datasets for the period 1787 to 1930 from Albania, Britain, Canada, Denmark, Egypt, Iceland, Ireland, Germany, Norway, Mexico, Sweden, and the United States. (2) Leverage our innovative record-linkage technology to create linked national panels that will allow expanded longitudinal analyses. (3) Connect the past to the present by merging NAPP with the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS), simplifying analysis of long-run change and ensuring long-run preservation and maintenance of the database. The landscape of scientific research on the human population is shifting. It is no longer sufficient just to study the relationships among variables at a particular moment in time. Researchers around the world now recognize that to understand the large-scale processes that are transforming society, we must investigate long-term change. The goal of this project is to provide the infrastructure to make such analysis possible. NAPP will make a strategic contribution to demographic infrastructure by providing a baseline for the study of changes in the demography and health of European and North American populations. In each country, NAPP provides the earliest census microdata available. Models and descriptions based on historical experience underlie both theories of past change and projections into the future. The NAPP data provide a unique laboratory for the study of economic and demographic processes; this kind of empirical foundation is essential for testing social and economic theory. The proposed work will be carried out by a team of highly-skilled researchers with unparalleled expertise and experience in data integration and record linkage. Collaborators include leading researchers from the University of Minnesota and the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research, and local experts from each of the participating countries. Centralized support for international collaboration will leverage the investments of each country and allow us to create an extraordinary resource for comparative social and economic research.        The North Atlantic Population Project (NAPP) provides fundamental infrastructure for scientific research, education, and policy-making and will allow social scientists to make comparisons across Northern Europe, the Mediterranean, and North America during three centuries of transformative change. The proposed work is directly relevant to the central mission of the NIH as the steward of medical and behavioral research for the nation: the new data will advance fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of human population dynamics. NAPP will unlock access to some of the largest and longest-running cross-sectional and longitudinal data sources in the world, and stimulate health-related research on population growth and movement, fertility, mortality, nuptiality, and family change, as well as the economic and social correlates of demographic behavior.

"UTMB Clinical and Translational Science Award UTMB's CTSA-linked KL2 Scholars Program addresses the significant need for developing future clinical and translational (C&T) investigators, with emphases on team-based research, leadership development, and mentorship training. In our new CTSA hub, we will build on our current CTSA's successes over the past 5½ years, with unique innovative integration of exceptional training approaches, including: 1) mentored career development within CTSA-supported multidisciplinary translational teams (MTTs); 2) an emphasis on individual development plans (IDPs) and pre-established C&T research competencies tailored to the needs of the individual scholar, but also emphasizing team-based competencies; 3) development of leadership competencies through participation in a new Leadership Development Academy; 4) an Academy of Research Mentors (ARM), based within our Institute for Translational Sciences (ITS), to foster mentoring and mentor training; 5) a linked Translational Research Scholars Program (TRSP), which provides an expanded peer group and a wider impact across the institution, with twice-monthly career development seminars and a focus on scholars' research; 6) development of entrepreneurial skills and leadership through participation in a UT System-funded Healthcare Entrepreneurship Program; and 7) collaboration and dissemination of program experience to other CTSA hubs in the Texas Regional CTSA Consortium, and the national CTSA Consortium. An important feature of our KL2 Scholars Program is its linked position within the continuum of career development, from graduate student training in our CTSA TL1 Training Core to the production of independently funded C&T faculty members. Our program is enhanced with by financial support from our Provost's office for scholar expenses, ITS education administrators, the ARM, and the Office of Faculty Affairs, which is focused on faculty development at UTMB. UTMB also ranks nationally in promoting diversity, which will enhance our recruitment of underrepresented minority scholars by the participation of faculty from our Hispanic Center of Excellence, and our Medical School Enrichment Program. Our KL2 Program is well-integrated with other institutional education activities, including our Human Pathophysiology and Translational Medicine graduate program, and courses targeted toward scientific writing, biostatistics, and study design. Early-career faculty as Phase 1 TRSP scholars can compete to become CTSA-supported KL2 Scholars, and with acquisition of their first mentored K-level grants (e.g., K08), advance to a Phase 2 TRSP Scholar, then focusing on the transition from mentored to independent grant funding. Upon acquisition of independent (e.g. R01) funding, scholars advance to become Phase 3 TRSP Scholars and Associate Members in the ARM, to facilitate their development of mentoring skills, and eventually to full ARM membership, with demonstrated success in C&T science mentoring. Our KL2 Scholars Program thus integrates novel team-based training, leadership, and mentoring approaches to foster the career development of future leaders in C&T research.

"EMR-Linked Biobank for Translational Genomics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medical care informed by genomic information is beginning to move into clinical practice. The Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network through its initial phases has provided much of the groundwork for this transformation. The Geisinger Health System project, ""EMR-Linked Biobank for Translational Genomics"" intends to build on the knowledge and experience from eMERGE phase II to accelerate discovery and implementation while expanding our understanding of the sociocultural implications of genomics in medicine. We will accomplish this goal through three specific aims: 1) Use existing biospecimens, genotype and sequence data and EMR-generated phenotypes for discovery in the proposed disorders: familial hypercholesterolemia and chronic rhinosinusitis, 2) Develop and test approaches for implementation of genomic information in clinical practice, 3) Explore, develop and implement novel approaches for family-centered communication around clinically relevant genomic results. We currently have over 60,000 patients broadly consented for research with a large and increasing proportion consented for return of results and deposition in the electronic health record. Over 18,000 patients are genotyped on high density platforms. Our two proposed phenotypes, familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) were chosen because both conditions have a significant public health impact in the United States, but they are also ideally suited to the specific aims of the project. They provide opportunities for innovation and extension of current eMERGE methods. While many of these innovations will take advantage of the sequencing done as part of the project, there are several other areas emphasized in the funding opportunity that will broaden the scope of eMERGE research. One of the areas of emphasis for eMERGE III is exploring the familial return of actionable results. FH is well suited to this, as the current clinical recommendation is cascade testing of family members for all diagnosed patients. Currently this relies on the patient to contact at risk family members, but this is less than optimal. We will explore this issue using qualitative and quantitative methods and use the results to design and test novel family communication strategies. Gene-environment interactions play an important role in the development and severity of disease. These are very difficult to study. We propose novel approaches that leverage the assets of Geisinger Health System and the eMERGE Network to develop and apply methods to extend existing projects that study the impact of environment on CRS. This would include the first large scale environment-wide association studies (EWAS). Finally, we propose to lead efforts to apply the tools of economic modeling and analysis to eMERGE projects to begin to quantify the value of implementation of genomic medicine in the US healthcare system. These proposed innovations will magnify the already significant impact that the eMERGE program has had in moving genomic medicine from a dream to a reality.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Through this application GHS seeks to continue its participation in the eMERGE Network for Phase III - Study Investigators U01 (RFA-HG-14-025) funding opportunity. We propose 3 specific aims: 1) use existing biospecimens, genotype and sequence data and EMR-generated phenotypes for discovery and validation of gene-phenotype associations; 2) develop and test approaches for implementation of genomic information in clinical practice; develop and implement novel approaches for family-centered communication around clinically relevant genomic results                ",EMR-Linked Biobank for Translational Genomics,8968014,U01HG008679,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Algorithms ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' Ambulatory Care ', ' Attitude ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communication ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' dreaming ', ' Dreams ', ' Economic Models ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Group Practice ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' familial hyperlipoproteinemia type II ', ' familial hyperlipoproteinemia type 2 ', ' familial hypercholesteremia ', ' familial hyperbetalipoproteinemia ', ' Type II Hyperlipidemia ', ' Type 2 Hyperlipidemia ', ' Hyperlipoproteinemia Type II ', ' Hyperlipoproteinemia Type 2 ', ' Hyperbetalipoproteinemia ', ' Essential Hypercholesterolemia ', ' Familial Hypercholesterolemia ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' Information Systems ', ' Inpatients ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Health Insurance ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Leadership ', ' Learning ', ' Lipids ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Rural Population ', ' Safety ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator ', ' CFTR Protein ', ' CFTR ', ' Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' County ', ' Generations ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Family member ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Caring ', ' Ecological Systems ', ' Ecologic Systems ', ' Ecosystem ', ' base ', ' density ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Integrated Health Care Systems ', ' Deposit ', ' Deposition ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Techniques ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' disease severity ', ' Severity of illness ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' experience ', ' environment effect on gene ', ' GxE interaction ', ' Gene x Environment Interaction ', ' gene environment interaction ', ' trait ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' case finding ', ' epidemiology study ', ' genetic epidemiology ', ' Genomics ', ' Provider ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' Health system ', ' Consent ', ' Data ', ' Prognostic/Survival Factor ', ' General Prognostic Factor ', ' Prognostic Factor ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Catchment Area ', ' Funding Opportunities ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' systems research ', ' implementation research ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' chronic rhinosinusitis ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical care ', ' population based ', ' treatment response ', ' clinical practice ', ' phenome ', ' biorepository ', ' biobank ', ' Phase III study ', ' phase 3 study ', ' screening ', ' ']",NHGRI,GEISINGER CLINIC,U01,2015,899776,PA-09,-0.0032258988794958143
"Center for Environmental Genetics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)        It is a priority of the CEG and the Career Development Program to identify and develop the careers of promising early stage investigators. To accomplish this goal, the overall objective of the career development program (CDP) is to recruit, enrich, encourage, and provide resources and mentoring activities to investigators at the graduate, postgraduate and early faculty levels with a particular emphasis on environmental health science. The CDP has forged new cross-disciplinary partnerships in areas applicable to environmental health science with basic, epidemiological, and/or clinical studies including studies in molecular genetics and environmental epidemiology and environmental toxicology.  To accomplish the overall objective, the CDP has developed a highly innovative approach with three specific.  Aim 1 is to attract, recruit and promote opportunities for junior faculty (within three years from initial appointment) towards development of an independent career interfacing between basic, translational or clinical investigations with application to environmental health science. The Next Generation Biomedical Investigator (NGBI) program is the principal mechanism for achieving this aim.  Aim 2 is to identify investigators with less experience (novice investigators) who are still in trainin with minimal experience but have an interest in examining the intricate role of environmental health science in health and disease. Recruits include physicians in their academic fellowship i.e. post residency, who are obtaining an MS or Ph.D, mentored postdoctoral Ph.D. fellows or advanced (third or fourth year) pre-doctoral research students. This aim is achieved by supplementing novice investigators' training with research resources, mentoring and career development opportunities through the New Investigator Scholar (NIS) pathway.  Aim 3 is to enrich training/scientific experiences, promote career opportunities and networking experiences, activities integrated with the Administrative and other CEG cores. The objective is to develop NGBIs and NISs and others new to environmental health science by enriching experiences as an investigator and eventually independent scientist. Thus, these aims are achieved through financial awards, mentorship, access to core resources and other career development activities.                  Our environmental health center focuses on understanding how genes and environment affect our health,  serving the residents, communities of Ohio, the nation and the globe by generating knowledge that is  applicable to the general public and policymakers for healthier living.",Center for Environmental Genetics,8832593,P30ES006096,"['Affect ', ' Air ', ' Arteries ', ' Attention ', ' behavioral disorder ', ' Behavior Disorders ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Cells ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Environmental Health ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Equipment ', ' Evolution ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Human Genome Project ', ' Immunological Diseases ', ' Immunologic Diseases ', ' Immune System Disorder ', ' Immune Dysfunction ', ' Immune Disorders ', ' Immune Diseases ', ' Immune System Diseases ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Mission ', ' Neurology ', ' Ohio ', ' Phenotype ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Power Plants ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Transportation ', ' Identical Twins ', ' Monozygotic twins ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Variation (Genetics) ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' malignant endocrine gland tumor ', ' Malignant Endocrine Tumor ', ' Malignant Endocrine Neoplasm ', ' Endocrine Gland Cancer ', ' Endocrine Cancer ', ' malignant endocrine gland neoplasm ', ' lipid disorder ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Funding ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Staging ', ' environmental agent ', ' Nature ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Route ', ' experience ', ' environment effect on gene ', ' GxE interaction ', ' Gene x Environment Interaction ', ' gene environment interaction ', ' health science research ', ' success ', ' Informatics ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' member ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Dose ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Core Facility ', ' Data ', ' Health Sciences ', ' NIH RFA ', ' Request for Applications ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Update ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Origin of Adult Disease ', ' Fetal Origin of Adult Disease ', ' Fetal Basis of Adult Disease ', ' FeBAD ', ' Barker Hypothesis ', ' whole-genome scan ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide scan ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome-wide scan ', ' genome-wide identification ', ' genome wide studies ', ' genome wide screen ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide analysis ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association study ', ' human capital ', ' endocrine disrupting ', ' Endocrine disruption ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' high risk ', ' clinical practice ', ' Allergic Disease ', ' nextgen sequencing ', ' next gen sequencing ', ' NGS system ', ' NGS Method ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' epigenome ', ' ']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI,P30,2015,1735289,OH-01,0.04349464374307567
"Bioinformatics Strategies for Multidimensional Brain Imaging Genetics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Today's generation of multi-modal imaging systems produces massive high dimensional data sets, which when coupled with high throughput genotyping data such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), provide exciting opportunities to enhance our understanding of phenotypic characteristics and the genetic architecture of human diseases. However, the unprecedented scale and complexity of these data sets have presented critical computational bottlenecks requiring new concepts and enabling tools. To address these challenges, using the study of Alzheimer's disease (AD) as a test bed, this project will develop and validate novel bioinformatics strategies for multidimensional brain imaging genetics. Aim 1 is to develop a novel bi- multivariate analysis strategy, S3K-CCA, for studying imaging genetic associations. Existing imaging genetics methods are typically designed to discover single-SNP-single-QT, single-SNP-multi-QT or multi-SNP-single- QT associations, and have limited power in revealing complex relationships between interlinked genetic markers and correlated brain phenotypes. To overcome this limitation, S3K-CCA is designed to be a sparse bi- multivariate learning model that simultaneously uses multiple response variables with multiple predictors for analyzing large-scale multi-modal neurogenomic data. Aim 2 is to develop HD-BIG, a visualization and systems biology framework for integrative analysis of High-Dimensional Brain Imaging Genetics data. Machine learning strategies to seamlessly incorporate valuable domain knowledge to produce biologically meaningful results is still an under-explored area in imaging genetics. In this aim, we will develop a user-friendly heat map interface to visualize high-dimensional results, adjust learning parameters and strategies, interact with existing bioinformatics resources and tools, and facilitate visual exploratory and systems biology analysis. A novel imaging genetic enrichment analysis (IGEA) method will be developed to identify relevant genetic pathways and associated brain circuits, and to reveal complex relationships among them. Aim 3 is to evaluate the proposed S3K-CCA and IGEA methods and the HD-BIG framework using both simulated and real imaging genetics data. This project is expected to produce novel bioinformatics algorithms and tools for comprehensive joint analysis of large scale heterogeneous imaging genetics data. The availability of these powerful methods is critical to the success of many imaging genetics initiatives. In addition, they can also help enable new computational applications in other areas of biomedical research where systematic and integrative analysis of large-scale multi-modal data is critical. Using AD as an exemplar, the proposed methods will demonstrate the potential for enhancing mechanistic understanding of complex disorders, which can benefit public health outcomes by facilitating diagnostic and therapeutic progress. Public Health Relevance (Narrative) Recent advances in multi-modal imaging and high throughput genotyping techniques provide exciting opportunities to enhance our understanding of phenotypic characteristics and underlying genetic mechanisms associated with human diseases. This proposal seeks to develop new bi-multivariate machine learning models and novel enrichment analysis methods, coupled with a visualization and systems biology framework, for integrative analysis of high-dimensional brain imaging genetics data.

"Multiscale Framework for Molecular Heterogeneity Analysis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genomic profiling has become a routine practice in selecting treatments for many diseases, enabling the classification of patients into categories that associate with improved outcomes for specific treatments. One potential detractor to this approach is the tremendous heterogeneity in tissues used for profiling. Genomic classifications, obtained from a relatively small biopsy, are subject to influence from broad, regional variations in the affected tissue. Heterogeneity on a cellular scale can also obscure the target of treatment, as cells with distinct molecular profiles are homogenized in genomic profiling. Realizing better therapies will depend greatly on the ability to understand molecular heterogeneity within an individual, a challenge that necessitates new approaches to organize, analyze and integrate data from multiple spatial and molecular scales. This proposal describes an informatics framework to characterizing heterogeneity for tissue based studies. The framework will combine imaging informatics with genomics to describe molecular heterogeneity at multiple spatial and molecular scales. The imaging component will leverage a novel quantum dot technology that enables detailed mapping of multiple protein expression pathways within a single sample. Fluorescence in situ hybridization imaging will be used to measure DNA content. Whole-slide digitization will enable computer algorithms to capture molecular profiles of hundreds of millions of cells, calculating quantitative features to describe their expression patterns and DNA content. Biologically meaningful descriptions of each cell will be generated using a novel active machine learning classifier to annotate cells with an ontology describing molecular biology and cell anatomy, enabling slides to be analyzed in a biological context. Cell boundaries, features, and annotations will be integrated through the Pathology Analytic Imaging Standards (PAIS) database to provide support for data mining analysis. Mining methods will be developed to find the enrichment of cellular phenotypes, and to analyze the spatial layout of cells with respect to structures like blood vessels to discover the influence of the tissue microenvironment on key expression pathways in surrounding cells. These tools will be applied to studies of glioblastoma brain tumors, but are relevant for studies of other solid tissue diseases. The scientific study wil use tissues resected in a novel clinical trial that accurately defines the invading tumor margin, bulk and necrosis-rich core. Tissues will be analyzed for gene expression and imaging to generate a paired genomic-imaging profile for each region. Mining the imaging and gene expression profiles of these regions will identify intra-tumoral differences in cellular phenotypes and illustrate the extent of variation in genomic classifications. The paired imaging and gene expression profiles will also be mined to determine relationships between specific expression classes and the imaging observations to illustrate a complete picture of heterogeneity. A project repository will be deployed to disseminate images, analysis pipelines and analytic results. This repository will provide a public resource for brain tumor research and access to open source tools. PROJECT NARRATIVE Developing effective treatments for disease requires an understanding of their molecular mechanisms. The software tools created by this research will enable researchers to better identify variations in the mechanisms of disease within an individual, and to develop and apply more effective therapies to improve patient outcomes.",Multiscale Framework for Molecular Heterogeneity Analysis,8897444,K22LM011576,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Biopsy ', ' vascular ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' tumors in the brain ', ' Brain Tumors ', ' Brain Neoplasia ', ' Brain Neoplasms ', ' Cells ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Environment ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Glioblastoma ', ' spongioblastoma multiforme ', ' glioblastoma multiforme ', ' Grade IV Astrocytoma ', ' Grade IV Astrocytic Tumor ', ' Grade IV Astrocytic Neoplasm ', ' Glioma ', ' neuroglia tumor ', ' neuroglia neoplasm ', ' glial-derived tumor ', ' Neuroglial Tumor ', ' Neuroglial Neoplasm ', ' Glial Tumor ', ' Glial Neoplasm ', ' Glial Cell Tumors ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Immunohistochemistry Staining Method ', ' Immunohistochemistry Cell/Tissue ', ' Immunohistochemistry ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Microscopy ', ' Mining ', ' DNA Molecular Biology ', ' Molecular Biology ', ' Necrotic ', ' Necrosis ', ' O2 element ', ' O element ', ' Oxygen ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' chromosome complement ', ' DNA Ploidy ', ' DNA Index ', ' DNA Content ', ' Ploidies ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Software Tools ', ' Technology ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Measures ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization ', ' FISH analysis ', ' FISH Technique ', ' FISH Technic ', ' Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Solid ', ' Diffuse ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Oxygen Deficiency ', ' Hypoxic ', ' Hypoxia ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Measurement ', ' Experiential Learning ', ' Active Learning ', ' Descriptor ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' human tissue ', ' Event ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Slide ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' Animal Model ', ' Informatics ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Categories ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Property ', ' repository ', ' Genomics ', ' protein expression ', ' Q-Dot ', ' Quantum Dots ', ' small molecule ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' tissue processing ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' molecular signature ', ' molecular profile ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' Expression Signature ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' Resolution ', ' Cellular Anatomy ', ' Cell Anatomy ', ' Subcellular Anatomy ', ' Conduct Clinical Trials ', ' Invaded ', ' Ontology ', ' Signaling Molecule ', ' Molecular ', ' Resected ', ' Process ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' imaging informatics ', ' molecular scale ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' computer algorithm ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' open source ', ' comparative ', ' tumor ', ' routine practice ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' exomes ', ' exome ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized medicine ', ' ']",NLM,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K22,2015,160696,GA-05,-0.04852085644909116
"The HMS Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology PROJECT SUMMARY  Systems and computational biologists, physician-scientists, pharmacologists, biochemists and cell biologists will collaborate in a new Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology (LSP) to apply a measure-model approach to understanding the mechanisms of action of therapeutic drugs in multiple disease areas. The LSP will pioneer the development of quantitative network-centric approaches to pharmacology and toxicology that include analysis of dose-time-response relationships at a single-cell level, modeling of cellular network dynamics and their perturbation by drugs, development of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic models in mouse and ultimately in man and use of systematic approaches to identify and qualify new drug targets. Our approach combines mathematical modeling with empirical measurement (including work with clinical samples and data) and aims to create quantitative and predictive drug response models at different temporal and physical scales. We aim to reinvigorate pharmacology and toxicology as foundational disciplines of translational medicine, develop the conceptual underpinning for personalized and precision medicine and lower the cost of drug discovery by improving its predictability. Close interactions with industry and the FDA will help address the productivity gap in drug discovery and development. The LSP is innovative with respect to its goal of using problems in basic and translational pharmacology to link three disciplines (cell and molecular biology, computational biology and medicine) and its aim of advancing therapeutic science in the Boston area and beyond. Students and postdocs supervised by 18 faculty members, 2 independent postdoctoral fellows and two PhD-level staff from 7 institutions will work in immediate proximity in a new custom-designed laboratory. The lab will host a new graduate program in therapeutics and multi-factored outreach activities that will promote systems pharmacology internationally.  These goals will be achieved through four inter-linked research programs (Aims 1-4), a core dedicated to efficient translation of LSP research (Aim 5), an education core and administrative/outreach activities (Aims 6-8). Aim 1 will focus on the determinants of dose-response at a single-cell level, including the role of cell-to-cell variability in fractional response and of timing and order-of-exposure in combination therapy. Aim 2 will take a network-level approach to understanding therapeutic, toxic and paradoxical drug responses by kinase inhibitors in three types of cancer. The mechanistic basis and consequences of poly-pharmacology will also be examined along with differential drug responsiveness by normal and diseased tissues. Aim 3 will address PK-PD by developing multi-scale models of drug actions at the level of cells, tissues and organisms and new methods for measuring drug distribution at the cellular and subcellular levels. Aim 4 will apply machine learning and causal reasoning to target discovery from clinical records in asthma, inflammatory disease and fibrosis and pursue a structure-guided approach to identifying regulators of ""undruggable "" targets. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The computational biologists, physician-scientists and pharmacologists in the Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology will apply a combined measure-model approach to understanding the mechanisms of action of therapeutic drugs in multiple disease areas. They will develop and apply new tools to (i) investigate the factors that determine the therapeutic index of drugs at a single cell level and in tissues (ii) apply knowledge of cellulr networks to develop a rational approach to combination therapy (iii) identify and qualify new drug targets for significant unmet medical needs. Success with our approach will advance personalized medicine and reduce the frequency of late-stage failure in drug discovery, thereby reducing the cost of new medicines.",The HMS Laboratory of

"Pharmaco Response Signatures and Disease Mechanism DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the HMS LINCS Center is to delineate the fundamental principles of cellular response to perturbagens at the level of single-cells and cell populations and to make response data routinely available via web-based browse, query and programmatic interfaces. This will involve the development and testing of new measurement methods, computational algorithms, and response signatures for diverse human cell types exposed to perturbations individually and in combination. We will emphasize the systematic collection of data not currently available in existing public databases including live and fixed-cell imaging, biochemical data on signaling proteins and multi-factorial drug-response phenotypes. A focus on diverse transformed and primary cells, including those derived from healthy and diseased donors, and on clinical grade small molecules (kinase inhibitors and epigenome drugs) will increase the translational impact of our work. The proposed LINCS Center represents a continuation of a program in operation for ~3.5 years under a LINCS pilot phase U54 award. We will expand the scope and sophistication of our Center, devoting  significant effort to (i) improving the quality of data analysis and visualization, particularly wih respect to the  complexities of perturbagen polypharmacy (ii) accelerating the release of perturbagen-response signatures  using methods that have been demonstrated to yield reliable and informative data, with a particular  emphasis on primary and non-transformed cells (iii) developing and applying new measurement methods,  particularly mass spectrometry for analysis of cell populations and live-cell imaging for analysis of single cells.  The work will involve nine complementary but independent aims. In Data Generation, Aim 1 will perform systematic analysis of perturbagen responses at a single-cell level. Aim 2 will collect multiplex protein and mRNA data on perturbagen response using a set of complementary imaging, mass spectrometry and bead-based assays. Aim 3 will apply LINCS methods to non-transformed immune cells and induced pluripotent stem cells, and explore if signatures can guide a detailed medicinal chemistry campaign. In Data Analysis, Aim 4 will construct perturbagen-response signatures using statistical modeling, network inference and machine learning methods. Aim 5 will develop new approaches to understanding and analyzing drug interactions on multiple phenotypes in single cells. Aim 6 will develop a novel compressed sensing framework for analyzing the poly-pharmacology of kinase inhibitors. Aim 7 will enhance the query, browse and explore functions of the HMS LINCS website and database and its integration with the UCSC Genome Browser. In Community Interaction and Outreach, Aim 8 will implement diverse training and outreach activities, including collaboration with LINCS and non-LINCS research groups. In Administration, Aim 9 will ensure effective management of the Center, sustained access to tools and data produced within the LINCS Project, and compliance with program goals. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Disease networks are complex interactions between multiple proteins. Precise understanding of the multifactorial perturbations imposed on multi-component networks is a crucial step in the development of a rational approach to drug discovery and personalization of therapy.

"Improving Prediction of Medical Responsiveness and Clinical Outcomes in Crohn's Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a K23 career development award resubmission for Dr. Ryan Stidham, a gastroenterologist at the University of Michigan. Dr. Stidham's long-term career goal is to develop objective prognostics to personalize treatment decisions for patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The immediate goals of the proposal are to evaluate both analytic morphomics, an image analysis platform to quantify CT scan findings, and serum glycoproteomic profiles to predict therapeutic response in patients with Crohn's disease. Dr. Stidham's integrated research and career development plan align with goals of developing himself as a collaborative translational investigator, skilled in statistical analysis o large datasets, applying novel prognostics to improve clinical outcomes in Crohn's disease. Crohn's disease (CD) affects over 700,000 patients in the United States. Nearly 60% of CD patients require surgical resection for medically-unresponsive disease within 10 years of diagnosis. Frequently, patients present with deep bowel injury composed of both medically-responsive inflammatory and non- responsive fibrotic injury. Despite the presence of an inflammatory target, medical therapy may be futile and timely surgical management should be pursued. Further, strategies using early high-intensity immunosuppression to prevent future fibrostenotic disease are likely to over treat portions of the CD population. Therefore, therapeutic decisions are predicated on (1) the probability that existing disease activity will respond to medical therapy and (2) the probability of developing future fibrostenotic complications. Assessment using colonoscopy and surrogates of inflammation including imaging, blood, and stool-based biomarkers fail to provide comprehensive and quantitative assessments of bowel injury, including fibrosis. Despite its importance, there are no measures to account for deep bowel wall injury and intestinal fibrosis. This research proposal will utilize quantitative imaging findings of deep bowel injury in conjunction with blood-based biomarkers reflecting disease phenotypes to predict medical failure, defined as requiring future bowel resection, hospitalization, and prolonged steroid use. To achieve our imaging aims (Aim 1) we will use analytic morphomics, a computer image analysis method, to quantify body and bowel composition from over 4,000 CT-enterographies in a longitudinal 1200 patient CD cohort. In Aim 2, serum glycoproteome variance will be characterized in carefully phenotyped inflammatory and stricturing subjects to refine our preexisting biomarkers of fibrosis. We have demonstrated that variations of the serum glycoproteome reflect the degree of intestinal fibrosis present and expect that serum glycoproteomics can differentiate inflammatory from fibrotic phenotypes in CD. Optimized serum glycoproteome profiles will be used to predict future conversion from B1- inflammatory disease to B2/3 fibrostenotic disease in a pediatric prospective-inception cohort (RISK study). Aim 3 entails a prospective study combining analytic morphomics and serum glycoproteome profiles to predict therapeutic response and clinical outcomes; providing preliminary data for future R03/R01 studies. Dr. Stidham is a Lecturer of Medicine at the University of Michigan Division of Gastroenterology. He earned his medical degree from the University of Virginia (AOA), completed an internal medicine residency at the University of Pennsylvania, and was a T-32 research fellow at the University of Michigan (2011). His research background combines laboratory and clinical experience with Dr. Peter Higgins (primary mentor), focusing on novel biomarker development. Dr. Stidham has been awarded several prior grants for pilot work, including a MICHR-CTSA T32 Pilot Grant for Proteomics and a Crohn's and Colitis Foundation Career Development Award for ultrasound imaging research. He is in the process of completing a Masters program in Clinical Research Design and Statistical Analysis at the University of Michigan School of Public Health (matriculation in April 2015). He has published in several gastroenterology journals, presented research internationally, and has built the independent collaborations featured in this proposal. Central to this career development award, the candidate will leverage the expertise of several mentors and collaborators to develop deep foundational skillsets in analytic imaging, translational proteomics, bioinformatics, and machine learning methods. The University of Michigan houses a nationally recognized Inflammatory Bowel Disease Program, internationally recognized proteomics expertise, and a dedicated Analytic Morphomics Group focused on computational image analysis of organs. The mentored research training will be supplemented with focused graduate-level coursework in bioinformatics, medical image analysis, machine learning methodologies, and decision support systems provided through the University of Michigan Center for Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics and the School of Public Health. The Division of Gastroenterology and Department of Medicine have a history of strong support for Dr. Stidham and will provide the time, resources, and mentorship necessary to achieve his professional and research goals. The training provided through this career development award will be pivotal for the candidate's development as an independent translational investigator focused on individualizing therapeutic management. This research will provide the foundation for future collaborative studies to further develop these and other prognostic tools for the inflammatory bowel diseases.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed work evaluates the capabilities of quantitative image analysis and serum glycoproteome profiles to predict the probability of medical response in Crohn's disease. Improved prediction of therapeutic response would tailor Crohn's disease management such that patients unlikely to benefit from medical therapy can proceed to timely surgical management and be spared the risks and costs of modern immunosuppressive treatments.        ",Improving Prediction of Medical Responsiveness and Clinical Outcomes in Crohn's Disease,8968013,K23DK101687,"['Accounting ', '

"SPORE in Skin Cancer The incidence of melanoma has risen dramatically in recent years, but no therapy has improved overall survival for the majority of patients with unresectable metastatic disease. The University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute (UPCI) Melanoma and Skin Cancer Program (MSCP) will continue to conduct a Specialized Program of Research Excellence (SPORE) to improve our understanding of molecular and immunologic mechanisms of cancer progression and to validate prognostic and predictive biomarkers for personalized treatment of advanced melanoma and cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL). Of our 4 Projects, 1 is continued from the prior funding period, and 3 new projects have been derived from developmental research conducted in the last period; 1 of the prior SPORE projects will be continued with independent ROI funding. Our highly integrated approach leverages complementary expertise in melanoma, oncology, dermatology, immunology, biostatistics, bioinformatics, machine learning, genomics, proteomics, and biomarker discovery to test hypotheses central to the improvement of therapeutic outcome in skin cancers. Regardless of clinical outcomes, these Projects will also generate urgently needed mechanistic data to inform development of new therapeutic strategies and pathways through which to monitor relapse and progression. Our 4 Projects will evaluate: (1) the prognostic and predictive value of the pro-inflammatory response and markers of immune suppression in relation to ipilimumab and interferon (IFN)¿ adjuvant therapy (leveraging an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group-led adjuvant trial); (2) an engineered, 3-antigen dendritic cell vaccine and IFN¿ boost in patients with metastatic melanoma; (3) the safety and efficacy of vemurafenib modulation of immunotherapy with IFN¿2b in patients with metastatic melanoma; and (4) an entirely new personalized microneedle vaccination technology in patients with melanoma and CTCL. The Administrative Core (A) coordinates the clinical research and provides scientific and fiscal oversight of the entire SPORE. The Biospecimen Core (B) is housed in the UPCI Immunologic Monitoring and Cellular Products Laboratory, where all tissue banking, biospecimen processing, and immune assays are conducted. The Biostatistics Core (C) and Informatics Core (D) support all projects with data analysis and management, respectively. We will continue to solicit, review, and fund applications for the career development and developmental research programs, which in the prior funding period led to the design of a new full project in this application (Project 3)  and the promotion of career development recipients to co-investigators and a project leader. The goal of this application is to use a multi-disciplinary approach to improve outcomes in skin cancer and in particular, metastatic melanoma, a disease with a 15% 5-year survival rate. We will improve treatment and outcomes for skin cancer patients by identifying new ways to treat the disease based on the biology of the individual patient's tumor and new biomarkers that predict risk and response to therapy to prevent recurrence based on an individual patient's genetics and the tumor impact upon the microenvironment.",SPORE in Skin Cancer,8919260,P50CA121973,"['inhibitor ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' immunogen ', ' ATGN ', ' Antigens ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biology ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' malignant skin tumor ', ' Malignant Skin Neoplasm ', ' Skin Cancer ', ' necrocytosis ', ' Cell Death ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' multimodality therapy ', ' combined treatment ', ' combined modality treatment ', ' combination therapy ', ' Multimodality Treatment ', ' Multimodal Treatment ', ' Multimodal Therapy ', ' Combined Modality Therapy ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Dermatology ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Engineering ', ' Faculty ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Housing ', ' Immunostimulation ', ' Immunological Stimulation ', ' Immunological Sensitization ', ' Immunologic Stimulation ', ' Immunologic Sensitization ', ' Immunization ', ' immunosuppression ', ' immune suppression ', ' Immunosuppressive Effect ', ' Immunosuppressions (Physiology) ', ' Immunosuppression Effect ', ' Natural immunosuppression ', ' immune therapy ', ' Immunologically Directed Therapy ', ' Immunotherapy ', ' Incidence ', ' Inflammation ', ' Recombinant Interferon Alfa-2b ', ' Interferonα-2b ', ' InterferonAlpha-2b ', ' Inteferon alpha 2b (human leukocyte clone Hif-SN 206 protein moiety reduced).

"Developing Risk Algorithms of Internalizing Disorder Etiology and Course ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Anxiety and mood disorders (internalizing disorders [IDs]) are common and debilitating conditions. The proposed Career Development Award will provide the candidate with the necessary skills to develop an independent research program focused on identifying how psychological/personality, environmental, and biomarker vulnerabilities predict the development and course of IDs using prospective observational survey designs. The applicant's prior research training involved studying the influence of psychological/personality vulnerabilities on ID severity and course in patient samples. In order to expand his research program, the applicant is seeking advanced training in two key areas (psychiatric epidemiology; machine learning methods) and supplemental training in two additional areas (self-assessed biomarkers; environmental vulnerabilities). Collectively, this training will provide the applicant with the skills (1) to study ID onset and course using prospective survey designs, and (2) to use machine learning methods to develop clinically-useful risk algorithms of ID onset and course using multiple vulnerability domains (psychological/ personality; environmental; biomarker). These skills will be developed through a combination of didactic training, guided readings, and mentored research projects. Training will occur in the Department of Health Care Policy at Harvard Medical School under the mentoring of Dr. Ronald Kessler (an expert in psychiatric epidemiology) and Dr. Sherri Rose (an expert in machine learning). The proposed research plan involves two phases. In Phase 1, machine learning methods will be used to analyze cross-sectional ID data from the World Mental Health (WMH) Surveys in order to develop risk algorithms that predict the onset of major depression, bipolar disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder (Specific Aim 1). Machine learning methods will also be applied to WMH Survey data to develop subtypes of bipolar disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder that maximize the prediction of their long-term course (Specific Aim 2). The proposed Phase 1 studies are highly innovative; in contrast to other areas of medicine, virtually no studies have attempted to develop ID risk algorithms or subtypes using machine learning methods. However, Phase 1 studies are also preliminary; replication and expansion of the algorithms is needed in prospective samples. Accordingly, Phase 2 of the research plan (Specific Aim 3) aims to test the feasibility of conducting a large prospective web-based survey study of psychological/personality (assessed via self-report and behavior), environmental (assessed via self-report), and biomarker (assessed via self-administered salivary assays) vulnerabilities of ID onset and course. Participants will be recruited online to complete a baseline survey and those determined to have an ID or be at high-risk of developing an ID will be asked to complete bimonthly follow-ups over the course of one year. The Phase 2 study is also innovative. Despite being called ""the future"" of epidemiological research, web-based survey studies of the IDs are rare. In addition, existing prospective epidemiological studies coarsely (i.e., dichotomously) assess IDs and their vulnerabilities, and have long gaps (1-4 years) between follow-ups. The use of bimonthly online surveys of the severity of IDs and their vulnerabilities will address these limitations. Phase 2 exploratory analyses will also be conduct in which latent ID trajectories are predicted using machine learning methods. Overall, the outlined training activities and mentored research projects will be used to develop an R01 application for a prospective epidemiological study that uses machine learning methods to develop clinically useful algorithms of ID onset and course using a broad range of psychological/personality, environmental, and biomarker vulnerabilities factors.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research aims to use cutting-edge statistical methods to develop clinically-useful (1) risk algorithms to identify who is at greatest risk of developing different internalizing disorders, and (2) subtypes of internalizing disorders that identify who is most likely to experience a persistence and chronic long-term disorder course. This research has important clinical and public health implications. With this research, individuals at risk of developing internalizing disorders can be targeted using early detection and prevention efforts, while those at risk of experiencing a persistent and chronic long-term course can be targeted using tailored/intensive internalizing disorder interventions.            ",Developing Risk Algorithms of Internalizing Disorder Etiology and Course,9032882,K01MH106710,"['Algorithms ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Appointment ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Data Collection ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Future ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' Health Surveys ', ' Literature ', ' Maintenance ', ' Medicine ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' Patients ', ' Personality ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Reading ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Rose ', ' Rosa ', ' Sampling Studies ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Societies ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' PTSD ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Stressful Event ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Activity ', ' forest ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Training ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition ', ' DSM4 ', ' DSM-IV ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Personality Traits ', ' Individual ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Generalized Anxiety Disorder ', ' disorder onset ', ' disease onset ', ' Onset of illness ', ' Baseline Surveys ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' interest ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' orphan disorder ', ' Rare Disorder ', ' Orphan Disease ', ' Rare Diseases ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Prevention ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' disease subtype ', ' disorder subtype ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Drops ', ' major depression ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Training ', ' Self-Administered ', ' Validation ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' salivary assay ', ' cost ', ' self reported behavior ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' prospective ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' population based ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' longitudinal course ', ' Phase I Study ', ' phase 1 study ', ' phase II study ', ' phase 2 study ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' ']",NIMH,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,K01,2015,166893,MA-07,-0.011902416949545363
"Interactive Informatics Resource for Research-driven Cancer Proteomics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In 2013 over 1.6 million new cases of cancer are expected to be diagnosed and over 580,000 people are expected to die of the disease. Thus, continued research in the identification of new diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of cancer is necessary. Although cancer is widely recognized as a genomic disease, the directives of the DNA-based drivers are executed at the level of proteins and their biological functions, and the application of potential protein level biomarkers remains a compelling vision. Thus, a large investment has been made by NCI and other research centers in high-throughput global proteomics experiments to mine for novel biomarkers of cancer. However, few of these markers have come to fruition. We believe that one of the major challenges to the discovery of robust protein- or pathway-biomarker candidates from these large and complex proteomics datasets is due to naive data analysis approaches that do not take into account the underlying complexity of the proteome (e.g., splice variants, post- translational modifications). State-of-the-art statistical algorithms to improve the tasks of quality assessment, peptide and protein quantification, and pathway modeling that are designed to account for the design of the experiment have been developed; however access to these methodologies by the larger community is hindered since they are in the prototype stage and typically require knowledge of statistical programming. Furthermore, the likelihood of these tools moving to robust software is low since they are developed within the context of existing grants that do not support the transition from prototype to software. For the field of clinical proteomics to successfully identif new mechanistic etiologies of cancer requires not only high quality data with respect to the instrument, but also high quality statistical analysis of the data. This project proposes new informatics technology in the form of a robust, interactive and cross- platform software environment that will enable biomedical and biological scientists to perform in-depth analyses of global proteomics data from the point of quality assessment and normalization of raw inferred abundances (e.g., peak area) to the identification of protein biomarkers and enriched pathways. The software will be designed in a single programming language (Java) to assure easy installation across platforms with wizard-based data entry and advanced data reporting. Java will also support the development of advanced graphical user interfaces for data presentation and interactive graphics with a modern look and feel. This approach will ensure that scientists outside of the development institution can develop modules to include in the software or extensions for data integration without challenges of re-compiling the application. The software modules to be developed under this project are Aim 1) peptide and protein level quality assessment and quantification, Aim 2) protein biomarker discovery via exploratory data analysis and machine learning, and Aim 3) pathway biomarker discovery through integration with the NCI Protein Interaction Database. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  For the past decade, cancer researchers have been utilizing global proteomics analyses to extensively categorize proteins and other molecular species in hopes of identifying distinctive features of cancer cells that not only explain the biology, but alo enable better patient care. Despite these investments, relatively few protein biomarkers have achieved clinical validation largely due to naive data analysis strategies used in the protein quantification and statistical validation of candidate biomarkers. This project will develop a robust user- friendly software environment that builds upon state-of-the-art statistical algorithms that are focused on addressing the underlying proteome complexity associated with cancer.",Interactive Informatics Resource for Research-driven Cancer Proteomics,8847691,U01CA184783,"['Accounting ', ' Algorithms ', ' Biology ', ' Breast ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Data Reporting ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Environment ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Institutes ', ' Investments ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Mining ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Statistical Models ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Peptide Fingerprinting ', ' Peptide Mapping ', ' Peptides ', ' Phenotype ', ' Programming Languages ', ' Protein Modification ', ' Posttranslational Protein Processing ', ' Posttranslational Modifications ', ' Post-Translational Protein Modification ', ' Post-Translational Modifications ', ' Post-Translational Modification Protein/Amino Acid Biochemistry ', ' Post-Translational Protein Processing ', ' gene product ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Splicing ', ' RNA Splicing ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Specificity ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' statistics ', ' Technology ', ' Translating ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' cartilage link protein ', ' link protein ', ' information security ', ' Data awareness ', ' Data Security ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Visualization ', ' Imagery ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Ovarian ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Java ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' prognostic ', ' Training ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Data Quality ', ' Funding ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' Letters ', ' Staging ', ' Malignant Cell ', ' cancer cell ', ' tool ', ' instrument ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' experience ', ' user friendly computer software ', ' user friendly software ', ' Informatics ', ' novel ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Proteome ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Proteomics ', ' developing computer software ', ' develop software ', ' software development ', ' Genomics ', ' model design ', ' data processing ', ' computerized data processing ', ' protein expression ', ' Institution ', ' Protein Fragment ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' NIAID ', ' National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease ', ' NIDDK ', ' National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ', ' prognostic indicator ', ' prognostic biomarker ', ' Prognosis Marker ', ' Molecular Marker of Prognosis ', ' Prognostic Marker ', ' Resource Informatics ', ' Sum ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Collection ', ' Validation ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Source Code ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' data integration ', ' Advanced Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' graphic user interface ', ' Graphical interface ', ' graphical user interface ', ' cancer proteomics ', ' next generation diagnostics ', ' new diagnostics ', ' novel diagnostics ', ' prototype ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' candidate validation ', ' Statistics Algorithm ', ' Statistical Algorithm ', ' mathematics methods ', ' mathematics methodology ', ' mathematics approach ', ' mathematical methodology ', ' mathematical approach ', ' math methods ', ' math methodology ', ' mathematical methods ', ' ']",NCI,BATTELLE PACIFIC NORTHWEST LABORATORIES,U01,2015,421696,WA-04,-0.03363817587415644
"An Integrative Bioinformatics Approach to Study Single Cancer Cell Heterogeneity DESCRIPTION:  My long term career goal is to become a leading expert in translational bioinformatics who creates, develops and applies computational and statistical methods to reveal landscapes of cancers and to identify strategies to cure cancers. Human cancers are highly heterogeneous. Such heterogeneity is the major source of the ultimate failure of most cancer agents. However, due to the limit of technologies, the intercellular heterogeneity has not been investigated genome wide, at single-cell level until recently. New technologies such as single-cell transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) and exome have revealed new insights and more profound complexity than was previously thought. However, so far these technologies are limited to one assay per cell. It remains a grand challenge to perform multiple, integrative assays from the same single tumor cell, in particular, from those derived from small tumor biopsies. Given the stochasticity at the single cell resolution, reproducibility and sensitivity ar daunting tasks. To overcome this challenge, I have started the single cancer cell sequencing analysis project, in collaboration with Dr. Sherman Weissman at Yale University, who is also my co-mentor of this K01 proposal. My immediate career goal is to identify genome-wide heterogeneity among single cancer cells, using the erythroleukemia K562 cell line. Towards this, I am proposing a research project on an integrative bioinformatics approach to analyze multiple types of genomics data generated from the same single leukemia cells, a timely and critical topic. Specifically, I am interested in studying the following specific aims: (1) buildinga bioinformatics pipeline to study heterogeneity of single-cell RNA-Seq, (2) building a bioinformatics pipeline to study CpG methylome of single cells, (3) building a bioinformatics pipeline to study single-cell Exome-Seq, and (4) integrate the RNA-Seq, methylome and Exome-Seq data generated from the same single cells. These single cells genomic data are provided by Dr. Sherman Weissman's lab from 30 single K562 erythroleukemia cells. I will first construct and validate in parallel, the RNA-Seq, methylome, and Exome-Seq bioinformatics pipelines optimized for single-cell analysis, and then develop and validate an integrative platform to analyze these multiple types of high-throughput data. To accomplish the research project, and to successfully transit from a junior faculty to an expert of the field, I have developed a career plan with my mentoring committee composed of four world-class experts in different fields relevant to Big Data Science: Primary Mentor Dr. Jason Moore in Bioinformatics from Dartmouth College, Co-mentor Dr. Sherman Weissman in Single-cell Genomics and Genetics from Yale University, Co-mentor Dr. Herbert Yu in Cancer Epidemiology from University of Hawaii Cancer Center and Co-mentor Dr. Jason Leigh in Big Data Visualization from the Information and Computer Science Department of University of Hawaii Manoa. I will primarily work with my four co-mentors for planning the development of my career during this award. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this K01 proposal is to integrate multiple types of high-throughput data, in particular, the transcriptome, exome-sequencing and CpG methylome data generated from single cancer cells. The proposed project is designed to address the urgent need for an integrative bioinformatics platform for mega-data generated from next-generation sequencing applications.

It is used by geneticists, genomics researchers, clinical researchers and molecular biologists to interpret the results of high-throughput experimental studies, by bioinformaticians seeking to develop novel algorithms for mining knowledge from genomics studies, and by systems biologists building predictive models of normal and abnormal pathways.  Our curational system draws heavily on the expertise of independent investigators within the community who author precise machine-readable descriptions of human biological pathways under the guidance of a staff of dedicated curators. Each pathway is extensively checked and peer-reviewed prior to publication to ensure its factual accuracy and compliance with the data model. A system of evidence tracking ensures that all assertions are backed up by the primary literature, and that human molecular events inferred from orthologous ones in animal models have an auditable inference chain. Curated pathways described by Reactome currently cover roughly one quarter of the translated portion of the genome. We also offer a network of ""functional interactions"" (FIs) predicted by a conservative machine-learning approach, that covers an additional quarter of the translated genome, for a combined coverage of roughly 50% of the known genome.  Over the next five years, we seek to (1) increase the number of curated proteins and other functional entities to at least 10,500; (2) to supplement normal pathways with variant reactions for 1200 genes representing disease states; (3) increase the size of the Reactome Fl network to 15,000 molecules; and (4) enhance the web site and other resources to meet the needs of a growing and diverse user community. RELEVANCE (See instructions):  Reactome represents one of a very small number of fully open access curated pathway databases. Its contents have contributed both directly and indirectly to large numbers of basic and translational research studies, and it supports a broad, diverse and engaged user community. As such it represents a key and irreplaceable community resource for genomics, genetics, systems biology, and translational researchers.",Reactome: An Open Knowledgebase of Human Pathways,8840984,U41HG003751,"['Algorithms ', ' Dorsum ', ' Back ', ' Behavior ', ' Communities ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Lipids ', ' Literature ', ' Logic ', ' Maps ', ' Mining ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' Peer Review ', ' gene product ', ' Proteins ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Software Tools ', ' Time ', ' transcription factor ', ' Translating ', ' Generations ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Visual ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Funding ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' Genetic ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Event ', ' Reaction ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' meetings ', ' Isoforms ', ' Protein Isoforms ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' Animal Model ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' Genomics ', ' miRNAs ', ' miRNA ', ' Micro RNA ', ' MicroRNAs ', ' small molecule ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Disease Pathway ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' web services ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' Instruction ', ' data modeling ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' touchscreen panel ', ' touch screen panel ', ' touch screen ', ' touch panel ', ' touchscreen ', ' biological research ', ' usability ', ' data transmission ', ' data exchange ', ' tablet device ', ' Tablet Computer ', ' ']",NHGRI,ONTARIO INSTITUTE FOR CANCER RESEARCH,U41,2015,1243799,,0.01368367278554552
"Development of mosaic mouse models of HCC for genetic interspecies inference DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a menace for human health for the lack of any effective treatment. HCC is usually the end result of chronic liver diseases associated with diverse risk factors. Furthermore, non- alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) induced HCC, which is projected to be the leading cause of new cases, remains poorly characterized. Although many mouse models of HCC have been developed, it is unclear how well they represent different subgroups of human HCCs. This research plan proposes to transform HCC animal modeling by establishing a novel in vivo platform to accurately replicate the somatic molecular profiles of human HCC in mice. To do this, three independent HCC mouse models will be exhaustively characterized through exome sequencing and gene expression profiling. Using bioinformatics techniques including machine- learning and network analysis, these datasets will be compared with human HCC datasets from TCGA and the ICGC to identify subgroups of patients with similar somatic molecular profiles to the HCC mouse models as well as refined minimum sets of characteristic genetic aberrations. A derived transposon system will be used to generate mosaic mouse models replicating human HCC genetic subgroups faithfully. These models will enable 1) experimental dissection of the molecular mechanisms underlying distinct etiologies of HCC, 2) systematic assessment of candidate HCC therapies and 3) investigation of therapeutic resistances. This K99/R00 career development award proposal describes a two-year mentored and three-year independent research program essential for the development of Dr. Font-Burgada as an independent investigator. Dr. Font-Burgada received his PhD at University of Barcelona, Spain, for the work he performed to investigate basic chromatin regulatory and epigenetic mechanisms. He then moved to University of California, San Diego where he joined Dr. Michael Karin's laboratory to train in mouse models of cancer and signal transduction. For the accomplishment of this research proposal, Dr. Font-Burgada has designed a strong training and career development plan consisting of: 1- the continued mentorship of Dr. Michael Karin to gain additional expertise in mouse models of HCC and signal transduction, 2- Training in bioinformatics, specifically in methods to identify cancer driver genetic aberrations and network-based approaches for comparative genomic analysis of mouse and human HCCs, to be overseen by co-mentor Dr. Hannah Carter, an Assistant Professor of Medicine, at UCSD. 3- Training in application of emerging transposon vector technologies to generate mosaic mouse models for in vivo analysis of oncogenic pathways. 4- Career development courses and seminars in a supportive academic environment in the Department of Pharmacology at UCSD to complement other aspects of the training program. This training plan will be overseen by an advisory committee comprising 4 members, mentor, co-mentor, and additional experts in mouse models of cancer and bioinformatics, Inder Verma and Trey Ideker, providing key scientific insights and essential guidance in critical steps in Dr. Font-Burgada transition to independence. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has a 5-year survival rate of less than 10% and leads to 700000 deaths globally each year. The genetic causes of this disease are poorly understood and the only available targeted therapy extends life expectancy by a mere 3 months. In order to improve these dismal statistics, I am developing a novel class of mouse models capable of reproducing the spectrum of mutations observed in a given human tumor, to enable study of HCC biology as well as systematic testing of therapeutic combinations.",Development of mosaic mouse models of HCC for genetic interspecies inference,8805692,K99CA191152,"['novel ', ' member ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Universities ', ' base ', ' Methods ', ' Technology ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Testing ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Mus ', ' Spain ', ' Mutation ', ' Training Programs ', ' statistics ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Translating ', ' Complement ', ' Medicine ', ' Diet ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Disease ', ' Dissection ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Modern Man ', ' Work ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Proposals ', ' California ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Human ', ' Laboratories ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cataloging ', ' Cell Culture Techniques ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Chromatin ', ' Research ', ' Cells ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Mice ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Murine ', ' Hepatocellular Carcinoma ', ' Hepatocellular cancer ', ' Hepatoma ', ' Liver Cells Carcinoma ', ' liver carcinoma ', ' Signaling ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Primary carcinoma of the liver cells ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Biology ', ' Beauty ', ' therapy resistant ', ' vector ', ' The Cancer Genome Atlas ', ' exome sequencing ', ' Investigators ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' Researchers ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Data ', ' cell culture ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' effective therapy ', ' pre-clinical ', ' Data Set ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Viral Vector ', ' Xenograft Model ', ' Oncogenic ', ' comparative ', ' mouse model ', ' Resistance ', ' combinatorial ', ' Monitor ', ' Network-based ', ' human disease ', ' Cancers ', ' tumor ', ' nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' developmental ', ' pathway ', ' preclinical ', ' designing ', ' resistance to therapy ', ' resistant to therapy ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Pre-Clinical Model ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' in vivo ', ' Subgroup ', ' Mouse Protein ', ' Orthologous Gene ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Preclinical Models ', ' B-raf-1 ', ' BRAF ', ' RAFB1 ', ' v-raf Murine Sarcoma Viral Oncogene Homolog B1 ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' K-Awards ', ' Research Career Program ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' NASH ', ' non-alcohol induced steatohepatitis ', ' non-alcoholic steato-hepatitis ', ' non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ', ' nonalcoholic steato-hepatitis ', ' Network Analysis ', ' effective treatment ', ' Ortholog ', ' TCGA ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' Expression Signature ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' molecular profile ', ' molecular signature ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Etiology ', ' dietary ', ' Death ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' Fats ', ' Mutate ', ' Mutation Spectra ', ' Disorder ', ' disease/disorder ', ' resistant ', ' Dataset ', ' Task Forces ', ' Modeling ', ' insight ', ' Development Plans ', ' Investigation ', ' career development ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Animal Model ', ' response ', ' Complex ', ' Hepatocyte ', ' chronic liver disease ', ' Knowledge ', ' Catalogs ', ' programs ', ' professor ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Human Pathology ', ' Physiologic ', ' Gene Expression Monitoring ', ' Gene Expression Pattern Analysis ', ' Transcript Expression Analyses ', ' Transcript Expression Analysis ', ' gene expression analysis ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' cancer progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' Hepatic Cells ', ' Hepatic Parenchymal Cell ', ' Liver Cells ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Comparative Genomic Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' BRAF gene ', ' Gene Expression Profiling ', ' Somatic Mutation ', ' Training ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Clinical ', ' tumor progression ', ' Genetic ', ' Label ', ' Phase ', ' improved ', ' Physiological ', ' neoplastic cell ', ' tool ', ' Transgenes ', ' Ensure ', ' success ', ' chronic hepatic disease ', ' chronic hepatic disorder ', ' chronic liver disorder ', ' Tumor Cell ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model organism ', ' kernel methods ', ' statistical learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' ']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",K99,2015,109620,CA-52,0.005859161659150454
"Elucidating the Role of the Genetic and Environmental Determinants of Preterm Birth Using Integrative Computational Approaches ABSTRACT Given the wealth and availability of genomic and environmental exposure data, computational methods provide a powerful opportunity to identify population-specific determinants of disease. Proper treatment of data types emerging from a diverse set of molecular and environmental profiling technologies cannot be analyzed using traditional statistical routines and new computational approaches are needed. In line with the President's Precision Medicine Initiative, the goal of this proposal is to develop computational methods and integrate large- scale genetic and environmental exposure datasets to elucidate factors that affect preterm birth (PTB) in diverse populations. Preterm birth, or the delivery of an infant prior to 37 weeks of gestation, is a major health concern. Infants born prematurely, comprising of about 12% of the US newborns, have elevated risks of neonatal mortality and a wide array of health problems. Preterm birth rates vary among different ethnic groups, with frequencies significantly elevated in African Americans and moderately elevated in Hispanics in comparison to Europeans. Environmental and socioeconomic factors alone may not explain these disparities and despite the evidence for a genetic basis to preterm birth, to date no causal genetic variants have been identified. In this proposal I aim to leverage the rich genetic and environmental variation data and develop computational approaches to advance our understanding of biology of preterm birth as it relates to all populations. To that extent, I propose three aims. In aim 1, I will develop computational methods to identify and validate novel genetic factors for preterm birth by genome-wide association (GWA) study in diverse ethnic populations. I obtained a comprehensive set of publicly available PTB case and control datasets consisting of ethnically diverse mothers and babies including 3,500 cases and nearly 16,000 controls from dbGAP and will carry out an ancestry-based case-control GWA study to identify genetic factors influencing PTB. In aim 2, I will develop analytical methodology to identify environmental and socioeconomic factors that impact preterm birth in diverse ethnic populations. I propose to integrate linked California State databases covering over 3 million births across diverse populations with geographical location data and pollution levels and UV exposure data from the Environmental Protection Agency in order to identify whether these exposures play a role in contributing to population-specific PTB risk. In aim 3, I will carry out integrative data analysis and build computational models in order to identify population specific interactions between the genetic and environmental factors affecting PTB risk. I hypothesize that gene-environment interactions contribute to population differences in preterm birth risk following environmental exposures. The proposed work will allow us to learn more about the etiology PTB, but could also be extended to other phenotypes of interest. This project is the logical next step for the study of the interaction of genetics and environment in the context of disease, which can be used to inform precise population-specific diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Given the wealth and availability of genomic and environmental exposure data, computational methods provide a powerful opportunity to identify population-specific determinants of disease. The goal of this proposal is to develop computational approaches to integrate diverse genetic and environmental exposure datasets to elucidate factors that affect disease in diverse populations and apply them to the study of preterm birth. The methodology developed as part of this proposal can be extended and applied to other phenotypes of interest and inform precise population-specific diagnostic and therapeutic

"Center for Environmental Genetics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)        It is a priority of the CEG and the Career Development Program to identify and develop the careers of promising early stage investigators. To accomplish this goal, the overall objective of the career development program (CDP) is to recruit, enrich, encourage, and provide resources and mentoring activities to investigators at the graduate, postgraduate and early faculty levels with a particular emphasis on environmental health science. The CDP has forged new cross-disciplinary partnerships in areas applicable to environmental health science with basic, epidemiological, and/or clinical studies including studies in molecular genetics and environmental epidemiology and environmental toxicology.  To accomplish the overall objective, the CDP has developed a highly innovative approach with three specific.  Aim 1 is to attract, recruit and promote opportunities for junior faculty (within three years from initial appointment) towards development of an independent career interfacing between basic, translational or clinical investigations with application to environmental health science. The Next Generation Biomedical Investigator (NGBI) program is the principal mechanism for achieving this aim.  Aim 2 is to identify investigators with less experience (novice investigators) who are still in trainin with minimal experience but have an interest in examining the intricate role of environmental health science in health and disease. Recruits include physicians in their academic fellowship i.e. post residency, who are obtaining an MS or Ph.D, mentored postdoctoral Ph.D. fellows or advanced (third or fourth year) pre-doctoral research students. This aim is achieved by supplementing novice investigators' training with research resources, mentoring and career development opportunities through the New Investigator Scholar (NIS) pathway.  Aim 3 is to enrich training/scientific experiences, promote career opportunities and networking experiences, activities integrated with the Administrative and other CEG cores. The objective is to develop NGBIs and NISs and others new to environmental health science by enriching experiences as an investigator and eventually independent scientist. Thus, these aims are achieved through financial awards, mentorship, access to core resources and other career development activities.                  Our environmental health center focuses on understanding how genes and environment affect our health,  serving the residents, communities of Ohio, the nation and the globe by generating knowledge that is  applicable to the general public and policymakers for healthier living.",Center for Environmental Genetics,9044557,P30ES006096,"['Affect ', ' Air ', ' Arteries ', ' Attention ', ' behavioral disorder ', ' Behavior Disorders ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Communities ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Environmental Health ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Equipment ', ' Evolution ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Human Genome Project ', ' Immunological Diseases ', ' Immunologic Diseases ', ' Immune System Disorder ', ' Immune Dysfunction ', ' Immune Disorders ', ' Immune Diseases ', ' Immune System Diseases ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Mission ', ' Neurology ', ' Ohio ', ' Phenotype ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Power Plants ', ' Public Health ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Transportation ', ' Monozygotic twins ', ' Identical Twins ', ' Variation (Genetics) ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Vision ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' symposium ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' malignant endocrine gland neoplasm ', ' malignant endocrine gland tumor ', ' Malignant Endocrine Tumor ', ' Malignant Endocrine Neoplasm ', ' Endocrine Gland Cancer ', ' Endocrine Cancer ', ' lipid disorder ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Funding ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Staging ', ' environmental agent ', ' Nature ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Route ', ' experience ', ' environment effect on gene ', ' GxE interaction ', ' Gene x Environment Interaction ', ' gene environment interaction ', ' health science research ', ' success ', ' Informatics ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' member ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Dose ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Core Facility ', ' Data ', ' Health Sciences ', ' NIH RFA ', ' Request for Applications ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Update ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Origin of Adult Disease ', ' Fetal Origin of Adult Disease ', ' Fetal Basis of Adult Disease ', ' FeBAD ', ' Barker Hypothesis ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' human capital ', ' endocrine disrupting ', ' Endocrine disruption ', ' integrative health ', ' integrative healing ', ' Integrative Medicine ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' high risk ', ' clinical practice ', ' Allergic Disease ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' nextgen sequencing ', ' next gen sequencing ', ' NGS system ', ' NGS Method ', ' epigenome ', ' ']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI,P30,2016,1729509,OH-01,0.04349464374307567

In our new CTSA hub, we will build on our current CTSA's successes over the past 5½ years, with unique innovative integration of exceptional training approaches, including: 1) mentored career development within CTSA-supported multidisciplinary translational teams (MTTs); 2) an emphasis on individual development plans (IDPs) and pre-established C&T research competencies tailored to the needs of the individual scholar, but also emphasizing team-based competencies; 3) development of leadership competencies through participation in a new Leadership Development Academy; 4) an Academy of Research Mentors (ARM), based within our Institute for Translational Sciences (ITS), to foster mentoring and mentor training; 5) a linked Translational Research Scholars Program (TRSP), which provides an expanded peer group and a wider impact across the institution, with twice-monthly career development seminars and a focus on scholars' research; 6) development of entrepreneurial skills and leadership through participation in a UT System-funded Healthcare Entrepreneurship Program; and 7) collaboration and dissemination of program experience to other CTSA hubs in the Texas Regional CTSA Consortium, and the national CTSA Consortium. An important feature of our KL2 Scholars Program is its linked position within the continuum of career development, from graduate student training in our CTSA TL1 Training Core to the production of independently funded C&T faculty members. Our program is enhanced with by financial support from our Provost's office for scholar expenses, ITS education administrators, the ARM, and the Office of Faculty Affairs, which is focused on faculty development at UTMB. UTMB also ranks nationally in promoting diversity, which will enhance our recruitment of underrepresented minority scholars by the participation of faculty from our Hispanic Center of Excellence, and our Medical School Enrichment Program. Our KL2 Program is well-integrated with other institutional education activities, including our Human Pathophysiology and Translational Medicine graduate program, and courses targeted toward scientific writing, biostatistics, and study design. Early-career faculty as Phase 1 TRSP scholars can compete to become CTSA-supported KL2 Scholars, and with acquisition of their first mentored K-level grants (e.g., K08), advance to a Phase 2 TRSP Scholar, then focusing on the transition from mentored to independent grant funding. Upon acquisition of independent (e.g. R01) funding, scholars advance to become Phase 3 TRSP Scholars and Associate Members in the ARM, to facilitate their development of mentoring skills, and eventually to full ARM membership, with demonstrated success in C&T science mentoring. Our KL2 Scholars Program thus integrates novel team-based training, leadership, and mentoring approaches to foster the career development of future leaders in C&T research.

"Development of mosaic mouse models of HCC for genetic interspecies inference DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a menace for human health for the lack of any effective treatment. HCC is usually the end result of chronic liver diseases associated with diverse risk factors. Furthermore, non- alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) induced HCC, which is projected to be the leading cause of new cases, remains poorly characterized. Although many mouse models of HCC have been developed, it is unclear how well they represent different subgroups of human HCCs. This research plan proposes to transform HCC animal modeling by establishing a novel in vivo platform to accurately replicate the somatic molecular profiles of human HCC in mice. To do this, three independent HCC mouse models will be exhaustively characterized through exome sequencing and gene expression profiling. Using bioinformatics techniques including machine- learning and network analysis, these datasets will be compared with human HCC datasets from TCGA and the ICGC to identify subgroups of patients with similar somatic molecular profiles to the HCC mouse models as well as refined minimum sets of characteristic genetic aberrations. A derived transposon system will be used to generate mosaic mouse models replicating human HCC genetic subgroups faithfully. These models will enable 1) experimental dissection of the molecular mechanisms underlying distinct etiologies of HCC, 2) systematic assessment of candidate HCC therapies and 3) investigation of therapeutic resistances. This K99/R00 career development award proposal describes a two-year mentored and three-year independent research program essential for the development of Dr. Font-Burgada as an independent investigator. Dr. Font-Burgada received his PhD at University of Barcelona, Spain, for the work he performed to investigate basic chromatin regulatory and epigenetic mechanisms. He then moved to University of California, San Diego where he joined Dr. Michael Karin's laboratory to train in mouse models of cancer and signal transduction. For the accomplishment of this research proposal, Dr. Font-Burgada has designed a strong training and career development plan consisting of: 1- the continued mentorship of Dr. Michael Karin to gain additional expertise in mouse models of HCC and signal transduction, 2- Training in bioinformatics, specifically in methods to identify cancer driver genetic aberrations and network-based approaches for comparative genomic analysis of mouse and human HCCs, to be overseen by co-mentor Dr. Hannah Carter, an Assistant Professor of Medicine, at UCSD. 3- Training in application of emerging transposon vector technologies to generate mosaic mouse models for in vivo analysis of oncogenic pathways. 4- Career development courses and seminars in a supportive academic environment in the Department of Pharmacology at UCSD to complement other aspects of the training program. This training plan will be overseen by an advisory committee comprising 4 members, mentor, co-mentor, and additional experts in mouse models of cancer and bioinformatics, Inder Verma and Trey Ideker, providing key scientific insights and essential guidance in critical steps in Dr. Font-Burgada transition to independence. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has a 5-year survival rate of less than 10% and leads to 700000 deaths globally each year. The genetic causes of this disease are poorly understood and the only available targeted therapy extends life expectancy by a mere 3 months. In order to improve these dismal statistics, I am developing a novel class of mouse models capable of reproducing the spectrum of mutations observed in a given human tumor, to enable study of HCC biology as well as systematic testing of therapeutic combinations.",Development of mosaic mouse models of HCC for genetic interspecies inference,9125796,K99CA191152,"['Beauty ', ' Biology ', '

"Pharmaco Response Signatures and Disease Mechanism DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the HMS LINCS Center is to delineate the fundamental principles of cellular response to perturbagens at the level of single-cells and cell populations and to make response data routinely available via web-based browse, query and programmatic interfaces. This will involve the development and testing of new measurement methods, computational algorithms, and response signatures for diverse human cell types exposed to perturbations individually and in combination. We will emphasize the systematic collection of data not currently available in existing public databases including live and fixed-cell imaging, biochemical data on signaling proteins and multi-factorial drug-response phenotypes. A focus on diverse transformed and primary cells, including those derived from healthy and diseased donors, and on clinical grade small molecules (kinase inhibitors and epigenome drugs) will increase the translational impact of our work. The proposed LINCS Center represents a continuation of a program in operation for ~3.5 years under a LINCS pilot phase U54 award. We will expand the scope and sophistication of our Center, devoting  significant effort to (i) improving the quality of data analysis and visualization, particularly wih respect to the  complexities of perturbagen polypharmacy (ii) accelerating the release of perturbagen-response signatures  using methods that have been demonstrated to yield reliable and informative data, with a particular  emphasis on primary and non-transformed cells (iii) developing and applying new measurement methods,  particularly mass spectrometry for analysis of cell populations and live-cell imaging for analysis of single cells.  The work will involve nine complementary but independent aims. In Data Generation, Aim 1 will perform systematic analysis of perturbagen responses at a single-cell level. Aim 2 will collect multiplex protein and mRNA data on perturbagen response using a set of complementary imaging, mass spectrometry and bead-based assays. Aim 3 will apply LINCS methods to non-transformed immune cells and induced pluripotent stem cells, and explore if signatures can guide a detailed medicinal chemistry campaign. In Data Analysis, Aim 4 will construct perturbagen-response signatures using statistical modeling, network inference and machine learning methods. Aim 5 will develop new approaches to understanding and analyzing drug interactions on multiple phenotypes in single cells. Aim 6 will develop a novel compressed sensing framework for analyzing the poly-pharmacology of kinase inhibitors. Aim 7 will enhance the query, browse and explore functions of the HMS LINCS website and database and its integration with the UCSC Genome Browser. In Community Interaction and Outreach, Aim 8 will implement diverse training and outreach activities, including collaboration with LINCS and non-LINCS research groups. In Administration, Aim 9 will ensure effective management of the Center, sustained access to tools and data produced within the LINCS Project, and compliance with program goals. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Disease networks are complex interactions between multiple proteins. Precise understanding of the multifactorial perturbations imposed on multi-component networks is a crucial step in the development of a rational approach to drug discovery and personalization of therapy. The LINCS Center we propose will develop innovative computational and experimental methods for understanding cellular perturbagen-response networks and will make the resulting data and new knowledge

"An Integrative Bioinformatics Approach to Study Single Cancer Cell Heterogeneity DESCRIPTION:  My long term career goal is to become a leading expert in translational bioinformatics who creates, develops and applies computational and statistical methods to reveal landscapes of cancers and to identify strategies to cure cancers. Human cancers are highly heterogeneous. Such heterogeneity is the major source of the ultimate failure of most cancer agents. However, due to the limit of technologies, the intercellular heterogeneity has not been investigated genome wide, at single-cell level until recently. New technologies such as single-cell transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) and exome have revealed new insights and more profound complexity than was previously thought. However, so far these technologies are limited to one assay per cell. It remains a grand challenge to perform multiple, integrative assays from the same single tumor cell, in particular, from those derived from small tumor biopsies. Given the stochasticity at the single cell resolution, reproducibility and sensitivity ar daunting tasks. To overcome this challenge, I have started the single cancer cell sequencing analysis project, in collaboration with Dr. Sherman Weissman at Yale University, who is also my co-mentor of this K01 proposal. My immediate career goal is to identify genome-wide heterogeneity among single cancer cells, using the erythroleukemia K562 cell line. Towards this, I am proposing a research project on an integrative bioinformatics approach to analyze multiple types of genomics data generated from the same single leukemia cells, a timely and critical topic. Specifically, I am interested in studying the following specific aims: (1) buildinga bioinformatics pipeline to study heterogeneity of single-cell RNA-Seq, (2) building a bioinformatics pipeline to study CpG methylome of single cells, (3) building a bioinformatics pipeline to study single-cell Exome-Seq, and (4) integrate the RNA-Seq, methylome and Exome-Seq data generated from the same single cells. These single cells genomic data are provided by Dr. Sherman Weissman's lab from 30 single K562 erythroleukemia cells. I will first construct and validate in parallel, the RNA-Seq, methylome, and Exome-Seq bioinformatics pipelines optimized for single-cell analysis, and then develop and validate an integrative platform to analyze these multiple types of high-throughput data. To accomplish the research project, and to successfully transit from a junior faculty to an expert of the field, I have developed a career plan with my mentoring committee composed of four world-class experts in different fields relevant to Big Data Science: Primary Mentor Dr. Jason Moore in Bioinformatics from Dartmouth College, Co-mentor Dr. Sherman Weissman in Single-cell Genomics and Genetics from Yale University, Co-mentor Dr. Herbert Yu in Cancer Epidemiology from University of Hawaii Cancer Center and Co-mentor Dr. Jason Leigh in Big Data Visualization from the Information and Computer Science Department of University of Hawaii Manoa. I will primarily work with my four co-mentors for planning the development of my career during this award. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this K01 proposal is to integrate multiple types of high-throughput data, in particular, the transcriptome, exome-sequencing and CpG methylome data generated from single cancer cells. The proposed project is designed to address the urgent need for an integrative bioinformatics platform for mega-data generated from next-generation sequencing applications.

"Transformative Computational Infrastructures for Cell-Based Biomarker Diagnostics Project Summary The presence of abnormal cell populations in patient samples is diagnostic for a variety of human diseases, especially leukemias and lymphomas. One of the main technologies used for cell-based diagnostic evaluation is flow cytometry, which employs fluorescent reagents to measure molecular characteristics of cell populations in complex mixtures. While cytometry evaluation is routinely used for the diagnosis of blood-borne malignancies, it could be more widely applied to the diagnosis of other diseases (e.g. asthma, allergy and autoimmunity) if it could be reproducibly used to interpret higher complexity staining panels and recognize more subtle cell population differences. Flow cytometry analysis is also widely used for single cell phenotyping in translational research studies to explore the mechanisms of normal and abnormal biological processes. More recently, the development of mass cytometry promises to further increase the application of single cell cytometry evaluation to understand a wide range of physiological, pathological and therapeutic processes. The current practice for cytometry data analysis relies on “manual gating” of two-dimensional data plots to identify cell subsets in complex mixtures. However, this process is subjective, labor intensive, and irreproducible making it difficult to deploy in multicenter translational research studies or clinical trials where protocol standardization and harmonization are essential. The goal of this project is to develop, validate and disseminate a user-friendly infrastructure for the computational analysis of cytometry data for both diagnostic and discovery applications that could help overcome the current limitations of manual analysis and provide for more efficient, objective and accurate analysis, through the following aims: Specific Aim 1 – Implement a novel computational infrastructure – FlowGate – for cytometry data analysis that includes visual analytics and machine learning; Specific Aim 2 – Assess the utility of FlowGate for cell population characterization in mechanistic translational research studies (T1); Specific Aim 3 – Assess the robustness and accuracy of FlowGate for clinical diagnostics in comparison with the current standard-of-care analysis of diagnostic cytometry data (T2); Specific Aim 4 – Develop training and educational resources and conduct directed outreach activities to stimulate adoption and use of the resulting FlowGate cyberinfrastructure. The project will have a major impact in advancing translational science by overcoming key hurdles for adoption of these computational methods by facilitating analysis pipeline optimization, providing intuitive user interfacing, and delivering directed training activities. The application of the developed computational infrastructure for improved diagnostics of AML and CLL will contribute to the new emphasis on precision medicine by more precisely quantifying the patient-specific characteristics of neoplastic and normal reactive cell populations. Although FlowGate will be developed by the UC San Diego, UC Irvine, and Stanford CTSAs, the resulting computational infrastructure will be made freely available to the entire research community. Project Narrative Flow cytometry analysis is widely used for single cell phenotyping in the translational research lab to explore the mechanisms of normal and abnormal biological processes and in the clinical diagnostic lab for the identification and classification of blood-borne malignancies. However, the current practice for cytometry data analysis using “manual gating” based on two-dimensional data plots is subjective, labor-intensive and unreliable, especially when using more complex high content staining panels.

"The HMS Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology PROJECT SUMMARY  Systems and computational biologists, physician-scientists, pharmacologists, biochemists and cell biologists will collaborate in a new Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology (LSP) to apply a measure-model approach to understanding the mechanisms of action of therapeutic drugs in multiple disease areas. The LSP will pioneer the development of quantitative network-centric approaches to pharmacology and toxicology that include analysis of dose-time-response relationships at a single-cell level, modeling of cellular network dynamics and their perturbation by drugs, development of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic models in mouse and ultimately in man and use of systematic approaches to identify and qualify new drug targets. Our approach combines mathematical modeling with empirical measurement (including work with clinical samples and data) and aims to create quantitative and predictive drug response models at different temporal and physical scales. We aim to reinvigorate pharmacology and toxicology as foundational disciplines of translational medicine, develop the conceptual underpinning for personalized and precision medicine and lower the cost of drug discovery by improving its predictability. Close interactions with industry and the FDA will help address the productivity gap in drug discovery and development. The LSP is innovative with respect to its goal of using problems in basic and translational pharmacology to link three disciplines (cell and molecular biology, computational biology and medicine) and its aim of advancing therapeutic science in the Boston area and beyond. Students and postdocs supervised by 18 faculty members, 2 independent postdoctoral fellows and two PhD-level staff from 7 institutions will work in immediate proximity in a new custom-designed laboratory. The lab will host a new graduate program in therapeutics and multi-factored outreach activities that will promote systems pharmacology internationally.  These goals will be achieved through four inter-linked research programs (Aims 1-4), a core dedicated to efficient translation of LSP research (Aim 5), an education core and administrative/outreach activities (Aims 6-8). Aim 1 will focus on the determinants of dose-response at a single-cell level, including the role of cell-to-cell variability in fractional response and of timing and order-of-exposure in combination therapy. Aim 2 will take a network-level approach to understanding therapeutic, toxic and paradoxical drug responses by kinase inhibitors in three types of cancer. The mechanistic basis and consequences of poly-pharmacology will also be examined along with differential drug responsiveness by normal and diseased tissues. Aim 3 will address PK-PD by developing multi-scale models of drug actions at the level of cells, tissues and organisms and new methods for measuring drug distribution at the cellular and subcellular levels. Aim 4 will apply machine learning and causal reasoning to target discovery from clinical records in asthma, inflammatory disease and fibrosis and pursue a structure-guided approach to identifying regulators of ""undruggable "" targets. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The computational biologists, physician-scientists and pharmacologists in the Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology will apply a combined measure-model approach to understanding the mechanisms of action of therapeutic drugs in multiple disease areas. They will develop and apply new tools to (i) investigate the factors that determine the therapeutic index of drugs at a single cell level and in tissues (ii) apply knowledge of cellulr networks to develop a rational approach to combination therapy (iii) identify and qualify new drug targets for significant unmet medical needs. Success with our approach will advance personalized medicine and reduce the frequency of late-stage failure in drug discovery, thereby reducing the cost of new medicines.",The HMS Laboratory of

"Training in lesion-symptom mapping for speech-language research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Training in lesion-symptom mapping for speech-language research Abstract: Researchers rely upon the lesion method to evaluate the speech-language status of stroke survivors and draw inferences about underlying brain function. This use of neuropsychology is highly valued in basic speech- language research because it can support causal inferences about brain structure/function relationships. Crucially, advances in analytic techniques and brain image computing are creating a new landscape for neuropsychological research. In this new landscape, the lesion method represents a form of big-data science that requires large sample sizes and complex image computing to implement lesion-symptom mapping (LSM) across the entire brain, without prior regions of interest. Expertise in these new techniques is becoming critical for high impact speech-language research. The career enhancement plan will provide the candidate with training in cutting-edge LSM. The candidate is an established speech-language investigator with a basic program of multidisciplinary research that includes populations with communication disorders due to stroke. The career enhancement will come at an ideal point, because it will build on the candidate's success in establishing an open-access research registry of stroke survivors (the Western Pennsylvania Patient Registry, WPPR), and current work to develop and validate collaborative videoconferencing for remote neuropsychological assessment. These efforts have created the recruitment pool and datasets that are needed for LSM. The career enhancement will provide the training needed to leverage these resources, thereby augmenting the candidate's program of research and career trajectory. The overarching objectives are to: (1) retool the skills of the candidate to infuse LSM into her program of speech-language research, (2) seed data sharing and data science partnerships to boost the candidate's leadership of WPPR as a national resource, and (3) advance understanding of LSM methods and the neural substrates for speech and language to improve the knowledge base of the candidate and other investigators. The candidate proposes a synergistic set of activities. Didactic activities will give training in machie learning and brain image computing, scholarly travel experiences will afford opportunities to network with speech-language researchers and data scientists whose work is relevant for LSM, and two research studies will provide a hands-on opportunity for the candidate to acquire, apply, and extend LSM methods under the guidance of a superb mentoring team. Study 1 will use univariate and multivariate LSM analysis to investigate the neural substrates of chronic Broca's aphasia and the factors that influence the reproducibility of LSM results. Study 2 will develop and evaluate a workflow for automated lesion segmentation, using a software platform (3D Slicer) that involves two NIH-supported data science centers. Overall, the career enhancement will retool the skills, research network, and knowledge base of an established investigator, allowing the candidate to significantly augment her program of speech-language research and advance the utility of WPPR as a national resource for speech-language research.

"INFORMATICS METHODS AND MODELS FOR COMPUTATIONAL PATHOLOGY DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The applicant is an Assistant Professor at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School.  The applicant's research program focuses on developing methods in translational bioinformatics to integrate heterogeneous biomedical data types (genomic, transcriptomic, microscopic, clinical) enabling the development of improved diagnostics and therapeutics for patients. Recent projects completed by the applicant include: the development of the Computational Pathology (C-Path) platform for building prognostic models from microscopic image data (Science Translational Medicine, 2011); and the development of the Significance Analysis of Prognostic Signatures method for identifying robust prognostic gene expression signatures form clinically annotated genomic data (PLoS Computational Biology, 2013).     This K22 award will provide the applicant with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become an expert at designing and using ontologies to model Computational Pathology data and to support a Computational Pathology Knowledgebase; (2) to become an expert at integrative predictive modeling of Computational Pathology data, gene expression data, and clinical outcomes data; and (3) to develop and manage an independent research career in translational bioinformatics. To achieve these goals, the applicant has assembled a team of mentors and collaborators with expertise in each of these areas of translational biomedical informatics. The team includes: Dr. Isaac Kohane, who is a Professor of Pediatrics, directs the Children's Hospital Informatics Program and leads an NLM-supported national center for biomedical computing; Dr. Ron Kikinis who is a Professor at Harvard Medical School, and the Robert Greenes Distinguished Director of Biomedical Informatics in the Department of Radiology at Brigham and Women's Hospital; and Dr. John Quackenbush, who is a Professor of Biostatistics and Computational Biology and Professor of Cancer Biology at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.     During the K22 award program, the applicant and his study team will develop informatics models and methods for Computational Pathology data. In Aim 1, they will develop a Computational Pathology Ontology to support a Computational Pathology Knowledgebase. The knowledgebase will be populated with microscopic phenotype data, gene expression data, and clinical outcomes data from over 2,500 cancer patients that underwent molecular profiling as part of The Cancer Genome Atlas project. In Specific Aim 2, they will develop and apply methods in machine learning to identify associations between gene expression and microscopic phenotypes. This information will be incorporated into the C-Path Knowledgebase. In Aim 3, they will use the C-Path Knowledgebase to build integrative prognostic models that jointly model quantitative morphological data and quantitative gene expression data to predict patient survival. The integrative prognostic models generated in breast, brain, kidney, and lung cancer will lead to more effective diagnostics for these malignancies.     The central hypothesis for this application is that morphological and molecular data are inherently complementary, and the most biologically informative and clinically useful predictive models will incorporate information from both of these heterogeneous data types. This research will form the basis for an R01 application to further develop and validate the informatics methods and models developed in this project. Project Narrative: This project will develop new computational methods for modeling quantitative microscopic phenotype data and for integrating microscopic disease phenotypes with gene expression data and clinical outcomes data.

"Development of tools for site-directed analysis of gene function The overarching goal of this application is to create tools and efficient methods to define genes that can promote human health. While a tremendous amount of data has been cataloged on gene mutation and changes in gene expression associated with complex human disease, our understanding of those genes that could be co-opted to restore patient health is lacking. To address this need and test for genes that when restored to wild type function promote health, we propose develop mutagenic, revertible and conditional alleles that provide spatial and temporal control of gene expression. The ability to make site-specific, untagged mutant alleles in zebrafish and other models has been greatly advanced by custom nucleases that include TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9 systems. These systems operate on the same principle: they are designed to bind to specific sequences in the genome and create a double strand break. The goals of this proposal leverage the activities of TALEN and CRISPR/Cas9 technologies to make site-specific double strand breaks. First, we propose to develop a suite of vectors to make integration alleles that are highly mutagenic and allow production of conditional and revertible alleles. Second, we propose to develop methods to generate predictable alleles in zebrafish at TALEN- and CRISPR/Cas9-induced double strand break sites by invoking the microhomology mediated end-joining pathway. Third, leveraging our preliminary data, we propose to improve methods for homology directed repair with oligonucleotides to create disease associated alleles in zebrafish and for site-specific integration using homologous recombination at TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9 cut sites. Fourth, we propose use single-strand annealing at TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9 cut sites to promote precise transgene integration to make tagged and highly mutagenic allele. These tools and techniques will have direct implications for providing precise gene editing techniques to assess the roles of genes in disease and their ability to promote health following disease progression. While we will develop these methodologies in zebrafish due to their ease of gene delivery, we anticipate these methodologies will not only enhance the efficiency of gene editing but will be readily adaptable for use in other model organisms and large animals. In our opinion, this will have important implications for modeling human disease and health in animal systems by greatly enhancing the ability to make predictible alleles, small nucleotide polymorphisms similar to those associated with human disease, and conditional alleles to test for the ability of a gene to restore health. The central goal for this application is to define genes that can promote or restore human health. For this, we propose to develop efficient integration of highly mutagenic and conditional cassettes into genes in a site-directed manner. The strategies proposed employ the ability of designer nucleases to create DNA double strand breaks and to site-specifically direct biochemical activities to genes of interest.

"Integrated Public Use Microdata Series: North Atlantic Population Project    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Research teams in the United States, Britain, Canada, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden have worked in close coordination to create the North Atlantic Population Project (NAPP), a massive integrated cross-national microdatabase that provides a baseline for studies of demographic change and opens fresh paths for spatiotemporal data analysis. We now propose improvements that will multiply the power of the NAPP infrastructure. We have three major aims: (1) Triple the size of the database to approximately 365 million records, adding 40 new datasets for the period 1787 to 1930 from Albania, Britain, Canada, Denmark, Egypt, Iceland, Ireland, Germany, Norway, Mexico, Sweden, and the United States. (2) Leverage our innovative record-linkage technology to create linked national panels that will allow expanded longitudinal analyses. (3) Connect the past to the present by merging NAPP with the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS), simplifying analysis of long-run change and ensuring long-run preservation and maintenance of the database. The landscape of scientific research on the human population is shifting. It is no longer sufficient just to study the relationships among variables at a particular moment in time. Researchers around the world now recognize that to understand the large-scale processes that are transforming society, we must investigate long-term change. The goal of this project is to provide the infrastructure to make such analysis possible. NAPP will make a strategic contribution to demographic infrastructure by providing a baseline for the study of changes in the demography and health of European and North American populations. In each country, NAPP provides the earliest census microdata available. Models and descriptions based on historical experience underlie both theories of past change and projections into the future. The NAPP data provide a unique laboratory for the study of economic and demographic processes; this kind of empirical foundation is essential for testing social and economic theory. The proposed work will be carried out by a team of highly-skilled researchers with unparalleled expertise and experience in data integration and record linkage. Collaborators include leading researchers from the University of Minnesota and the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research, and local experts from each of the participating countries. Centralized support for international collaboration will leverage the investments of each country and allow us to create an extraordinary resource for comparative social and economic research.        The North Atlantic Population Project (NAPP) provides fundamental infrastructure for scientific research, education, and policy-making and will allow social scientists to make comparisons across Northern Europe, the Mediterranean, and North America during three centuries of transformative change. The proposed work is directly relevant to the central mission of the NIH as the steward of medical and behavioral research for the nation: the new data will advance fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of human population dynamics. NAPP will unlock access to some of the largest and longest-running cross-sectional and longitudinal data sources in the world, and stimulate health-related research on population growth and movement, fertility, mortality, nuptiality, and family change, as well as the economic and social correlates of demographic behavior.

"EMR-Linked Biobank for Translational Genomics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medical care informed by genomic information is beginning to move into clinical practice. The Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network through its initial phases has provided much of the groundwork for this transformation.

We will accomplish this goal through three specific aims: 1) Use existing biospecimens, genotype and sequence data and EMR-generated phenotypes for discovery in the proposed disorders: familial hypercholesterolemia and chronic rhinosinusitis, 2) Develop and test approaches for implementation of genomic information in clinical practice, 3) Explore, develop and implement novel approaches for family-centered communication around clinically relevant genomic results. We currently have over 60,000 patients broadly consented for research with a large and increasing proportion consented for return of results and deposition in the electronic health record. Over 18,000 patients are genotyped on high density platforms. Our two proposed phenotypes, familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) were chosen because both conditions have a significant public health impact in the United States, but they are also ideally suited to the specific aims of the project. They provide opportunities for innovation and extension of current eMERGE methods. While many of these innovations will take advantage of the sequencing done as part of the project, there are several other areas emphasized in the funding opportunity that will broaden the scope of eMERGE research. One of the areas of emphasis for eMERGE III is exploring the familial return of actionable results. FH is well suited to this, as the current clinical recommendation is cascade testing of family members for all diagnosed patients.

"Multimodal Biomarkers in Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K01 award will support my development as an independent investigator with a translational research program that specializes in the cognitive and biological basis of neurodegenerative diseases such as frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Candidate: My research experience as a cognitive neuroscientist ideally positions me to achieve my career goal of becoming an independent investigator with expertise on the cognitive and biological basis of neurodegenerative disease. I have strong cognitive training with an M.Sc in Psycholinguistics and Ph.D in Psychology from the University of Edinburgh, where I was supported by an NRSA Individual Predoctoral Award. During my postdoctoral IGERT fellowship at the Institute for Research in Cognitive Science at the University of Pennsylvania, I was awarded an NRSA Individual Postdoctoral Fellowship Award to investigate the role of decision-making in language. In this research I have gained experience investigating neurodegenerative disease patients comparatively in order to obtain converging evidence to complement fMRI studies of healthy adults. I have become increasingly interested in translating my research to optimize the diagnosis and treatment of patients with neurodegenerative diseases. I was recently award the Society for the Neurobiology of Language Postdoctoral Merit Award in recognition of my novel research investigating how social limitations in patients contribute to difficulty in discourse. I have committed to four years of clinical research the NIH Loan Repayment Program, and I intend to commit to clinical research for the duration of my career. I have learned that cognitive and neuroimaging studies provide only one perspective on neurodegenerative diseases. In this proposal, I plan to gain the necessary expertise in biological aspects of FTLD and related conditions to complement my past experiences, and thus achieve my goal of becoming a multifaceted independent investigator with expertise in the cognitive and biological basis for neurodegenerative diseases. With the support of this K01, I will develop expertise to conduct investigations of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), genetic, and neuropathological aspects of neurodegenerative diseases. I will ultimately integrate the biological expertise gained in this proposal with language studies from my cognitive neuroscience research in an effort to identify non-invasive biomarkers that can be used to screen patients for clinical trials and to measure the efficacy of disease-modifying agents. Environment: This award will be conducted at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in the Department of Neurology, the Center for Neurodegenerative Disease Research (CNDR), and the Penn Bioinformatics Center where I have strong institutional support. The proposed institution is an exceptional environment that has expert centers for neuroimaging, cerebrospinal fluid biomarker analysis, a leading genetic research core, expert neuropathology, outstanding biostatisical support, and relevant clinical research laboratories. The University of Pennsylvania is unique in comparison to other institutions in the country because all of the above methods are available in one center. My mentor, Dr. Murray Grossman, and my co-mentor, Dr. John Trojanowksi, have international reputations for neurodegenerative disease research. My career development will also be supported by my co-mentor, Dr. Lyle Ungar, who has extensive expertise in statistical learning algorithms and in the analysis of proteomic and genomics datasets. Together, this mentorship team will facilitate my development as an independent investigator by providing access to existing and future collaborators, laboratory resources, and exceptional training environments. The CNDR is a world- leading center for neurodegenerative disease research with human and animal models of disease and exceptional translational science. Biofluid biomarker experience is extensive, and several national biofluid cores are centered at Penn (e.g. ADNI). There is a wealth of internationally-recognized neuroimaging expertise at the University of Pennsylvania in the Penn Imaging and Computer Science Laboratory, and I will benefit by integrating neuroimaging resources from these facilities with other modalities of biomarker research. Training: I will develop my expertise in the biological basis of neurodegenerative disease with the support of my mentor, Dr. Murray Grossman, and my co-mentors, Dr. John Trojanowski and Dr. Lyle Ungar. Specifically, with Dr. Trojanowksi I will engage in training related to biofluid and genetic biomarkers of FTLD. I will develop advanced neuroimaging skills and cutting-edge biostatistical methods with Dr. Ungar. Each of these training modalities will be supported by complementary formal coursework, participation in seminars, attendance of conferences, and regularly scheduled meetings with mentorship team. Research: FTLD is a neurodegenerative disease affecting approximately 15 out of 100,000 individuals. In recent years detailed neuropathological investigations at autopsy have demonstrated distinct sources of histopathological abnormalities in FTLD, including the presence of tau inclusions (FTLD-tau) and TDP-43 proteinopathies (FTLD-TDP). However, there are currently no in vivo methods for discriminating between FTLD-tau and FTLD-TDP. There is an urgent need to improve the in vivo diagnosis of FTLD to appropriately enter patients into emerging clinical trials, and to develop sensitive and specific endpoints in trials that can quantify response to these treatments. The overall research aim of this proposal is to develop multimodal methods to improve in vivo diagnosis of FTLD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) affects approximately 15 out of 100,000 adults. Detailed neuropathological investigations at autopsy have identified two distinct sources of histopathological changes that contribute to FTLD. However, there are currently no in vivo methods for diagnosing pathological subtypes of FTLD. There is an urgent need to identify in vivo diagnosis methods to facilitate the identification of appropriate patients to enter into emerging disease-modifying drug treatment trials. The overall aim of this project is to identify multimodal biomarkers of FTLD.",Multimodal Biomarkers in Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration,9068732,K01AG043503,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+

Dr. Stidham's integrated research and career development plan align with goals of developing himself as a collaborative translational investigator, skilled in statistical analysis o large datasets, applying novel prognostics to improve clinical outcomes in Crohn's disease. Crohn's disease (CD) affects over 700,000 patients in the United States. Nearly 60% of CD patients require surgical resection for medically-unresponsive disease within 10 years of diagnosis. Frequently, patients present with deep bowel injury composed of both medically-responsive inflammatory and non- responsive fibrotic injury. Despite the presence of an inflammatory target, medical therapy may be futile and timely surgical management should be pursued. Further, strategies using early high-intensity immunosuppression to prevent future fibrostenotic disease are likely to over treat portions of the CD population. Therefore, therapeutic decisions are predicated on (1) the probability that existing disease activity will respond to medical therapy and (2) the probability of developing future fibrostenotic complications. Assessment using colonoscopy and surrogates of inflammation including imaging, blood, and stool-based biomarkers fail to provide comprehensive and quantitative assessments of bowel injury, including fibrosis. Despite its importance, there are no measures to account for deep bowel wall injury and intestinal fibrosis. This research proposal will utilize quantitative imaging findings of deep bowel injury in conjunction with blood-based biomarkers reflecting disease phenotypes to predict medical failure, defined as requiring future bowel resection, hospitalization, and prolonged steroid use. To achieve our imaging aims (Aim 1) we will use analytic morphomics, a computer image analysis method, to quantify body and bowel composition from over 4,000 CT-enterographies in a longitudinal 1200 patient CD cohort. In Aim 2, serum glycoproteome variance will be characterized in carefully phenotyped inflammatory and stricturing subjects to refine our preexisting biomarkers of fibrosis. We have demonstrated that variations of the serum glycoproteome reflect the degree of intestinal fibrosis present and expect that serum glycoproteomics can differentiate inflammatory from fibrotic phenotypes in CD. Optimized serum glycoproteome profiles will be used to predict future conversion from B1- inflammatory disease to B2/3 fibrostenotic disease in a pediatric prospective-inception cohort (RISK study). Aim 3 entails a prospective study combining analytic morphomics and serum glycoproteome profiles to predict therapeutic response and clinical outcomes; providing preliminary data for future R03/R01 studies. Dr. Stidham is a Lecturer of Medicine at the University of Michigan Division of Gastroenterology. He earned his medical degree from the University of Virginia (AOA), completed an internal medicine residency at the University of Pennsylvania, and was a T-32 research fellow at the University of Michigan (2011). His research background combines laboratory and clinical experience with Dr. Peter Higgins (primary mentor), focusing on novel biomarker development. Dr. Stidham has been awarded several prior grants for pilot work, including a MICHR-CTSA T32 Pilot Grant for Proteomics and a Crohn's and Colitis Foundation Career Development Award for ultrasound imaging research. He is in the process of completing a Masters program in Clinical Research Design and Statistical Analysis at the University of Michigan School of Public Health (matriculation in April 2015). He has published in several gastroenterology journals, presented research internationally, and has built the independent collaborations featured in this proposal. Central to this career development award, the candidate will leverage the expertise of several mentors and collaborators to develop deep foundational skillsets in analytic imaging, translational proteomics, bioinformatics, and machine learning methods. The University of Michigan houses a nationally recognized Inflammatory Bowel Disease Program, internationally recognized proteomics expertise, and a dedicated Analytic Morphomics Group focused on computational image analysis of organs. The mentored research training will be supplemented with focused graduate-level coursework in bioinformatics, medical image analysis, machine learning methodologies, and decision support systems provided through the University of Michigan Center for Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics and the School of Public Health. The Division of Gastroenterology and Department of Medicine have a history of strong support for Dr. Stidham and will provide the time, resources, and mentorship necessary to achieve his professional and research goals. The training provided through this career development award will be pivotal for the candidate's development as an independent translational investigator focused on individualizing therapeutic management. This research will provide the foundation for future collaborative studies to further develop these and other prognostic tools for the inflammatory bowel diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed work evaluates the capabilities of quantitative image analysis and serum glycoproteome profiles to predict the probability of medical response in Crohn's disease. Improved prediction of therapeutic response would tailor Crohn's disease management such that patients unlikely to benefit from medical therapy can proceed to timely surgical management and be spared the risks and costs of modern immunosuppressive treatments.",Improving Prediction of Medical Responsiveness and Clinical Outcomes in Crohn's Disease,9119811,K23DK101687,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', '

"Integrative Bioinformatics Approaches to Human Brain Genomics and Connectomics Project Summary (Abstract)  Human brain connectomics and imaging genomics are two emerging research fields enabled by recent advances in multi-modal neuroimaging and high throughput omics technologies. Integrating brain imaging genomics and connectomics holds great promise for a systematic characterization of both the human brain connectivity and the connectivity-based neurobiological pathway from its genetic architecture to its influences on cognition and behavior. Rich multi-modal neuroimaging data coupled with high density omics data are available from large-scale landmark studies such as the NIH Human Connectome Project (HCP) and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). The unprecedented scale and complexity of these data sets, however, have presented critical computational bottlenecks requiring new concepts and enabling tools.  To bridge the gap, this project is proposed to develop and validate novel integrative bioinformatics approaches to human brain genomics and connectomics, and has three aims. Aim 1 is to develop a novel computational pipeline for a systematic characterization of structural connectome optimized for imaging genomics, where special consideration will be taken to address important issues including reliable tractography and network construction, systematic extraction of network attributes, identification of important network components (e.g., hubs, communities and rich clubs), prioritization of network attributes towards genomic analysis, and identification of outcome-relevant network measures. Aim 2 is to develop novel bioinformatics strategies to determining genetic basis of structural connectome, including novel approaches for analyzing graph-based phenotype data and learning outcome-relevant associations, and an ensemble of effective learning modules to handle a comprehensive set of scenarios on mining genome-connectome associations at the genome-wide connectome-wide scale. Aim 3 is to develop a visual analytic software system for interactive visual exploration and mining of fiber-tracts and brain networks with their genetic determinants and functional outcomes, where new visualization and exploration methods will be implemented for seamlessly combining human expertise and machine intelligence to enable novel contextually meaningful discoveries.  This project is expected to produce novel bioinformatics algorithms and tools for comprehensive joint analysis of large scale genomics and connectomics data. The availability of these powerful methods and tools is critical for full knowledge discovery and exploitation of major connectomics and imaging genomics initiatives such as HCP and ADNI. In addition, they can also help enable new computational applications in many other biomedical research areas where integrative analysis of connectomics and genomics data are of interest. Via thorough test and evaluation on HCP and ADNI data, these methods and tools will be demonstrated to have considerable potential for a better understanding of the interplay between genes, brain connectivity and function, and thus be expected to impact biomedical research in general and benefit public health outcomes. Public Health Relevance (Narrative) Integrating human connectomics and brain imaging genomics offers enormous potential, allowing us to perform systems biology approaches of the brain to better understand the interplay between genes, brain connectivity, and phenotypic outcomes (e.g., cognition, behavior, disorder). This proposal seeks to develop novel bioinformatics methods and software tools for integrative study of human connectomics and brain imaging genomics. These methods and tools can be applied to: (1) study normal brain functions to impact biomedical research in general, and (2) study brain disorders to improve public health outcomes by facilitating diagnostic and therapeutic progress.",Integrative Bioinformatics Approaches to Human Brain Genomics and Connectomics,9155025,R01EB022574,"['abstracting ', ' Algorithms ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Architecture ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Beds ', ' Behavior ', ' behavioral disorder ', ' Behavior Disorders ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Cognition ', ' Communities ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Mining ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Neurologic Organ System ', ' Neurologic Body System ', ' Nervous System ', ' Nervous system structure ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurobiology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Software Tools ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Visualization ', ' Imagery ', ' base ', ' density ', ' evaluation/testing ', ' improved ', ' brain visualization ', ' Brain imaging ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' Fiber ', ' insight ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Sample Size ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' interest ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Graph ', ' substantia alba ', ' white matter ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' Genomics ', ' genetic determinant ', ' Genetic Determinism ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' brain tract ', ' Address ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Data ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' cost ', ' software systems ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Outcome ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' data acquisition ', ' public health relevance ', ' genome-wide ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' Knowledge Discovery ', ' Learning Module ', ' Teaching Module ', ' Educational Module ', ' Education Module ', ' learning outcome ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' whole genome ', ' entire genome ', ' connectome ', ' genomic data ', ' ']",NIBIB,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2016,500696,IN-07,0.014863419206747639
"NIDA Center of Excellence OF Computational Drug Abuse Research (CDAR) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose to establish a NIDA Center of Excellence for Computational Drug Abuse Research (CDAR) between the University of Pittsburgh (Pitt) and (CMU), with the goal of advancing and ensuring the productive and broad usage of state-of-the-art computational technologies that will facilitate and enhance drug abuse (DA) research, both in the local (Pittsburgh) area and nationwide. To this end, we will develop/integrate tools for DA-domain-specific chemical-to-protein-to-genomics mapping using cheminformatics, computational biology and computational genomics methods by centralizing computational chemical genomics (or chemogenomics) resources while also making them available on a cloud server. The Center will foster collaboration and advance knowledge-based translational research and increase the effectiveness of ongoing funded research project (FRPs) via the following Research Support Cores: (1) The Computational Chemogenomics Core for DA (CC4DA) will help address polydrug addiction/polypharmacology by developing new chemogenomics tools and by compiling the data collected/generated, along with those from other Cores, into a DA knowledge-based chemogenomics (DA-KB) repository that will be made accessible to the DA community. (2) The Computational Biology Core (CB4DA) will focus on developing a resource for structure-based investigation of the interactions among substances of DA and their target proteins, in addition to assessing the drugability of receptors and transporters involved in DA and addiction. These activities will be complemented by quantitative systems pharmacology methods to enable a systems-level approach to DA research. (3) The Computational Genomics Core (CG4DA) will carry out genome-wide discovery of new DA targets, markers, and epigenetic influences using developed machine learning models and algorithms. (4) The Administrative Core will coordinate Center activities, provide management to oversee the CDAR activities in consultation with the Scientific Steering Committee (SSC) and an External Advisory Board (EAB), ensure the effective dissemination of software/data among the Cores and the FRPs, and establish mentoring mechanisms to train junior researchers. Overall, the Center will strive to achieve the long-term goal of translating advances in computational chemistry, biology and genomics toward the development of novel personalized DA therapeutics. We propose a Computational Drug Abuse Research (CDAR) Center, as a joint initiative between the  University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University.

"Statistical Modeling of Complex Traits in Genetic Reference Super-Populations DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Genetic crosses in model organisms play an essential role in understanding the heritable architecture of medically relevant phenotypes. Traditionally, such crosses have tended to be on a small scale with either limited power to detect genetic effects or limited resolution to localize causal variants. Recently, however, the emergence of larger-scale interdisciplinary research, cheaper genotyping and parallel advances in human genetics, have spurred the development of more sophisticated and powerful experimental designs. Genetic Resource Populations (GRPs) use economies of scale to provide cost-effective and replicable platforms for genetic studies. This project concerns the largest, most ambitious GRP in mouse genetics to date, the Collaborative Cross (CC), and a series of crosses and designs related to or derived from it: the Diversity Outbred (DO) cross, the CC Recombinant Inbred Cross (CC-RIX) and the diallel. Experiments on each separate cross provide distinct information about the heritable architecture of a target complex disease. In combination, this Genetic Reference Super-Population (GRSP) potentially provides an unparalleled basis for cross-study replication and integration in mouse genetics. This project aims to develop statistical methods that advance the current state of complex trait analysis of these populations separately, and, by exploiting the unique structure that connects them, proposes to develop a statistical framework that allows for their joint use.  Aim 1 develops a Bayesian probabilistic framework for haplotype-based analysis of quantitative trait loci (QTL). Aim 1a develops a statistical software module for flexible haplotype-based analysis, which can be ex- tended by the researcher to model a rich variety of designs and disease types. Aim 1b will adapt machine learning techniques to provide posterior inference of the allelic series of a QTL. Aim 1c will incorporate Bayesian modeling of polygenic effects.  Aim 2 and 3 concern joint analysis, building on the foundation set by Aim 1. Aim 2 develops methods to optimize experimental design of follow-up studies in one population given results from another. Aim 2a uses the diallel to inform design of CC/CC-RIX/DO experiments. Aim 2b uses partial data on CC/CC-RIX/DO to guide collection of additional data. Aim 3 explores models for jointly analyzing multiple populations in the GRSP, using complementary datasets to stabilize analysis at single QTL (Aim 3a) and across multiple QTL (Aim 3b).  These aims address specific and persistent challenges in the cost-effective design and efficient analysis of multiparent genetic data, in particular the CC, DO, CC-RIX and diallel. The project will generate tools useful for a wide range of model organism crosses and can be applied to the genetic study of any complex disease. The proposed research will lead to improvements in the analysis and design of genetic studies on animal models of human disease. Because the project focuses on statistical methodology applied to experimental mouse populations, the scientific output of the project is expected to be applicable to basic research focusing on any medical condition that can be studied in the mouse.",Statistical Modeling of Complex Traits in Genetic Reference Super-Populations,9126587,R01GM104125,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Anxiety ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Architecture ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Genetic Crosses ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Foundations ', ' Genotype ', ' Haplotypes ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Human Genetics ', ' Hybrids ', ' Inbreeding ', ' Influentials ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Technology ', ' Weight ', ' Generations ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' insight ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Funding ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' QTL ', ' Quantitative Trait Loci ', ' success ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' Animal Model ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' genetic resource ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Population Analysis ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Recombinants ', ' Resolution ', ' Collection ', ' Genetic Algorithm ', ' Genetic Programming ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Output ', ' disease phenotype ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' Coupled ', ' Plug-in ', ' human disease ', ' population based ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' Bayesian Modeling ', ' Bayesian tracking algorithms ', ' Bayesian statistical models ', ' Bayesian spatial models ', ' Bayesian spatial image models ', ' Bayesian spatial data model ', ' Bayesian nonparametric models ', ' Bayesian network model ', ' Bayesian hierarchical model ', ' Bayesian framework ', ' Bayesian belief updating model ', ' Bayesian belief network ', ' Bayesian adaptive models ', ' Bayesian adaptive designs ', ' Genetic study ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2016,241086,NC-04,-0.014759678335424749
"Reactome: An Open Knowledgebase of Human Pathways DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We seek renewal of the core operating funding for the Reactome Knowledgebase of Human Biological Pathways and Processes. Reactome is a curated knowledgebase available online as an open access resource that can be freely used and redistributed by all members of the biological research community. It is used by geneticists, genomics researchers, clinical researchers and molecular biologists to interpret the results of high-throughput experimental studies, by bioinformaticians seeking to develop novel algorithms for mining knowledge from genomics studies, and by systems biologists building predictive models of normal and abnormal pathways.  Our curational system draws heavily on the expertise of independent investigators within the community who author precise machine-readable descriptions of human biological pathways under the guidance of a staff of dedicated curators. Each pathway is extensively checked and peer-reviewed prior to publication to ensure its factual accuracy and compliance with the data model. A system of evidence tracking ensures that all assertions are backed up by the primary literature, and that human molecular events inferred from orthologous ones in animal models have an auditable inference chain. Curated pathways described by Reactome currently cover roughly one quarter of the translated portion of the genome. We also offer a network of ""functional interactions"" (FIs) predicted by a conservative machine-learning approach, that covers an additional quarter of the translated genome, for a combined coverage of roughly 50% of the known genome.  Over the next five years, we seek to (1) increase the number of curated proteins and other functional entities to at least 10,500; (2) to supplement normal pathways with variant reactions for 1200 genes representing disease states; (3) increase the size of the Reactome Fl network to 15,000 molecules; and (4) enhance the web site and other resources to meet the needs of a growing and diverse user community.

"SPORE in Skin Cancer The incidence of melanoma has risen dramatically in recent years, but no therapy has improved overall survival for the majority of patients with unresectable metastatic disease. The University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute (UPCI) Melanoma and Skin Cancer Program (MSCP) will continue to conduct a Specialized Program of Research Excellence (SPORE) to improve our understanding of molecular and immunologic mechanisms of cancer progression and to validate prognostic and predictive biomarkers for personalized treatment of advanced melanoma and cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL). Of our 4 Projects, 1 is continued from the prior funding period, and 3 new projects have been derived from developmental research conducted in the last period; 1 of the prior SPORE projects will be continued with independent ROI funding. Our highly integrated approach leverages complementary expertise in melanoma, oncology, dermatology, immunology, biostatistics, bioinformatics, machine learning, genomics, proteomics, and biomarker discovery to test hypotheses central to the improvement of therapeutic outcome in skin cancers. Regardless of clinical outcomes, these Projects will also generate urgently needed mechanistic data to inform development of new therapeutic strategies and pathways through which to monitor relapse and progression. Our 4 Projects will evaluate: (1) the prognostic and predictive value of the pro-inflammatory response and markers of immune suppression in relation to ipilimumab and interferon (IFN)¿ adjuvant therapy (leveraging an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group-led adjuvant trial); (2) an engineered, 3-antigen dendritic cell vaccine and IFN¿ boost in patients with metastatic melanoma; (3) the safety and efficacy of vemurafenib modulation of immunotherapy with IFN¿2b in patients with metastatic melanoma; and (4) an entirely new personalized microneedle vaccination technology in patients with melanoma and CTCL. The Administrative Core (A) coordinates the clinical research and provides scientific and fiscal oversight of the entire SPORE.

"Interactive Informatics Resource for Research-driven Cancer Proteomics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In 2013 over 1.6 million new cases of cancer are expected to be diagnosed and over 580,000 people are expected to die of the disease. Thus, continued research in the identification of new diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of cancer is necessary. Although cancer is widely recognized as a genomic disease, the directives of the DNA-based drivers are executed at the level of proteins and their biological functions, and the application of potential protein level biomarkers remains a compelling vision. Thus, a large investment has been made by NCI and other research centers in high-throughput global proteomics experiments to mine for novel biomarkers of cancer. However, few of these markers have come to fruition. We believe that one of the major challenges to the discovery of robust protein- or pathway-biomarker candidates from these large and complex proteomics datasets is due to naive data analysis approaches that do not take into account the underlying complexity of the proteome (e.g., splice variants, post- translational modifications). State-of-the-art statistical algorithms to improve the tasks of quality assessment, peptide and protein quantification, and pathway modeling that are designed to account for the design of the experiment have been developed; however access to these methodologies by the larger community is hindered since they are in the prototype stage and typically require knowledge of statistical programming. Furthermore, the likelihood of these tools moving to robust software is low since they are developed within the context of existing grants that do not support the transition from prototype to software. For the field of clinical proteomics to successfully identif new mechanistic etiologies of cancer requires not only high quality data with respect to the instrument, but also high quality statistical analysis of the data. This project proposes new informatics technology in the form of a robust, interactive and cross- platform software environment that will enable biomedical and biological scientists to perform in-depth analyses of global proteomics data from the point of quality assessment and normalization of raw inferred abundances (e.g., peak area) to the identification of protein biomarkers and enriched pathways. The software will be designed in a single programming language (Java) to assure easy installation across platforms with wizard-based data entry and advanced data reporting. Java will also support the development of advanced graphical user interfaces for data presentation and interactive graphics with a modern look and feel. This approach will ensure that scientists outside of the development institution can develop modules to include in the software or extensions for data integration without challenges of re-compiling the application. The software modules to be developed under this project are Aim 1) peptide and protein level quality assessment and quantification, Aim 2) protein biomarker discovery via exploratory data analysis and machine learning, and Aim 3) pathway biomarker discovery through integration with the NCI Protein Interaction Database. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  For the past decade, cancer researchers have been utilizing global proteomics analyses to extensively categorize proteins and other molecular species in hopes of identifying distinctive features of cancer cells that not only explain the biology, but alo enable better patient care. Despite these investments, relatively few protein biomarkers have achieved clinical validation largely due to naive data analysis strategies used in the protein quantification and statistical validation of candidate biomarkers. This project will develop a robust user- friendly software environment that builds upon state-of-the-art statistical algorithms that are focused on addressing the underlying proteome complexity

"Integration and Visualization of Diverse Biological Data ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The onset of most human disease involves multiple, molecular-level changes to the complex system of interacting genes and pathways that function differently in specific cell-lineage, pathway and treatment contexts. While this system has been probed by the thousands of functional genomics and quantitative genetic studies, careful extraction of signals relevant to these specific contexts is a challenging problem. General integration of these heterogeneous data was an important first step in detecting signals that be used to build networks to generate experimentally-testable hypotheses. However, only by dealing with the fact that disease happens at the intersection of multiple contexts and by integrating functional genomics with quantitative genetics will we be able to move toward a molecular-level understanding of human pathophysiology, which will pave the way to new therapy and drug development.  The long-term goal of this project is to enable such discoveries through the development of innovative bioinformatics frameworks for integrative analysis of diverse functional genomic data. In the previous funding periods, we developed accurate data integration and visualization methodologies for most common model organisms and human, created methods for tissue-specific data analysis, and applied these methods to make novel insights about important biological processes. We further enabled experimental biological discovery by implementing these methods in publicly accessible interactive systems that are popular with experimental biologists.  Leveraging our prior work, we now will directly address the challenge of enabling data-driven study of molecular mechanisms underlying human disease by developing novel semi-supervised and multi-task machine learning approaches and implementing them in a real-time integration system capable of predicting genome-scale functional and mechanism-specific networks focused on any biological context of interest. This will allow any biomedical researcher to quickly make data-driven hypotheses about function, interactions, and regulation of genes involved in hypertension in the kidney glomerulus or to predict new regulatory interactions relevant to Parkinson's disease that affect the ubiquitination pathway in Substantia nigra. Furthermore, we will develop methods for disease gene discovery that leverage these highly specific networks for functional analysis of quantitative genetics data. Our deliverable will be a general, robust, user-friendly, and automatically updated system for user-driven functional genomic data integration and functional analysis of quantitative genetics data. Throughout this work, we (with our close experimental and clinical collaborators) will also apply our methods to chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease/hypertension, and autism spectrum disorders both as case studies for the iterative improvement of our methods and to make direct contribution to better understanding of these diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will create a web-accessible system that will enable biologists and clinicians to generate hypotheses regarding disease-linked genes, molecular mechanisms underlying genetic disorders, and drug discovery for more targeted treatment. Underlying this user-friendly web interface will be novel algorithms for on-the-fly integration of  vast amount of functional genomics and quantitative genetics data based on the context(s) defined by the biologist or clinician. As applied to the three case study areas, chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease/hypertension, and autism spectrum disorders, our system has the potential to identify novel disease genes and pathways and to enable development of better diagnostic biomarkers, drug targets, and, in the longer term, treatments.",Integration and Visualization of Diverse Biological Data,9057057,R01GM071966,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' computing system ', ' Computer Systems ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Feedback ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Au element ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' hereditary disorder ', ' genetic disorder ', ' Molecular Disease ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' Genetic Condition ', ' Hereditary Disease ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' renal glomerulus ', ' kidney glomeruli ', ' Malpighian Tuft ', ' Kidney Glomerulus ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Nephrology ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Parkinsons disease ', "" Parkinson's disease "", "" Parkinson's "", ' Parkinson ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Real-Time Systems ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Substantia Nigra ', ' Substantia nigra structure ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Case Study ', ' case report ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Visualization ', ' Imagery ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Systems Integration ', ' Funding ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Collaborations ', ' Letters ', ' Cell Lineage ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' Animal Model ', ' novel ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Modeling ', ' drug development ', ' Genetic Information Databases ', ' Genetic Databanks ', ' Genetic Data Bases ', ' Genetic Data Banks ', ' Genetic Databases ', ' functional genomics ', ' drug discovery ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Address ', ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' Quantitative Genetics ', ' ubiquitin conjugation ', ' ubiquination ', ' Ubiquitinoylation ', ' Ubiquitilation ', ' Ubiquitination ', ' Update ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' data integration ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' user-friendly ', ' web interface ', ' web-accessible ', ' Network-based ', ' multitask ', ' multi-task ', ' human disease ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new drugs ', ' new drug treatments ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' gene discovery ', ' discover genes ', ' genome-wide ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted therapy ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' Genetic study ', ' clinical investigation ', ' data visualization ', ' diagnostic biomarker ', ' diagnostic marker ', ' genomic data ', ' ']",NIGMS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,445349,NJ-12,-0.03120702439740665
"Computational Modeling of Heterogeneous Gene Expression in Single Cells ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The recent development of single cell RNA-seq protocols enabled genomewide investigation of organismal systems at the cellular level, opening many new biological questions for study. Single cell resolution allows characterization of rare or unknown cell types, enables dissection of differentiation processes, and aids in decoding regulatory networks responsible for healthy and diseased states of cells. However, current single cell RNA-seq studies are limited by crucial gaps in existing computational methods.  We have devised strategies to address three key limitations of current single cell RNA-seq analysis methods: (1) lack of models for isoform-specific expression, (2) inability to link gene expression differences with measurable changes in cell function, and (3) lack of methods for studying sequential progression of gene expression changes. To address the first shortcoming, we developed SingleSplice, an algorithm for identifying genes whose isoform ratios vary more than expected by chance across a set of single cells (Aim 1). We have also developed a novel microraft platform that allows culturing, functional characterization, isolation, and subsequent sequencing of single cells. Using data generated from this platform, we will perform supervised machine learning to identify genes linked to functional differences among cells (Aim 2). To address the third limitation, we will use locally linear embedding, a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique, to identify ""trajectories"" of cells proceeding through sequential processes such as development and response to stimuli (Aim 3). We will apply our methods to our own data generated from microraft experiments, as well as publicly available single cell RNA-seq data from developing lung tissue and immune cells responding to immune stimulation.  Using data from experiments in which spike-in transcripts are added at constant, known amounts to cells to mimic an alternative splicing change, we found that SingleSplice detects isoform switching with high sensitivity (73%) and specificity (93%). We used microrafts to sequence single cells from a pancreatic cancer cell line and found that this approach produced high-quality data comparable to that from the Fluidigm C1. The microraft technology also enabled us to sequence RNA from pancreatic cancer cells after gemcitabine treatment and measure the proliferation of the cells, identifying both ""drug resistant"" cells that divide and cels that do not proliferate, giving a dataset with matched functional and transcriptomic measurements. Preliminary investigation of a dataset in which dendritic cells were stimulated with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) shows that locally linear embedding (LLE) can order cells according to the length of time they have been exposed to LPS.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Until very recently, studies have relied on aggregate measurements taken from bulk samples of cells, but in many important health-related applications, the information lost by lumping together thousands of cells poses a real barrier to understanding. Neurological conditions, cancer, and stem cell therapies are among the many areas that call for single cell RNA-seq methods. We propose to develop broadly applicable computational methods that will eliminate key limitations of current analyses and enable groundbreaking research in many domains important for public health.            ",Computational Modeling of Heterogeneous Gene Expression in Single Cells,9051866,F31HG008912,"['Algorithms ', ' Alternative RNA Splicing ', ' Alternate Splicing ', ' Alternative Splicing ', ' Motility ', ' Cellular Motility ', ' Cellular Migration ', ' Cell Movement ', ' Cell Migration ', ' Cell Locomotion ', ' cell motility ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell physiology ', ' cell sorting ', ' Cell Separation Technology ', ' Cell Segregation ', ' Cell Isolation ', ' Cell Separation ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Veiled Cells ', ' Dendritic Cells ', ' Dissection ', ' resistant to Drug ', ' resistance to Drug ', ' drug resistant ', ' Drug resistance ', ' drug treatment ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Exhibits ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Lipopolysaccharides ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Lung ', ' Methods ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' Noise ', ' Pancreatic ', ' Pancreas ', ' Phenotype ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Specificity ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' gemcitabine ', ' dFdCyd ', ' dFdC ', ' Difluorodeoxycytidine ', ' Measures ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Glean ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' RNA Sequences ', ' Area ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Link ', ' infantile ', ' infancy ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' Data Quality ', ' Measurement ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' Pancreatic Cancer ', ' Pancreas Cancer ', ' Malignant Pancreatic Neoplasm ', ' Malignant neoplasm of pancreas ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Investigation ', ' Immune ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' cell type ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' Cellular Proliferation ', ' Cell Multiplication ', ' Cell Growth in Number ', ' Cell Proliferation ', ' Tumor Cell ', ' neoplastic cell ', ' Isoforms ', ' Protein Isoforms ', ' novel ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Lung Tissue ', ' Lung Parenchyma ', ' Structure of parenchyma of lung ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' stem cell therapeutics ', ' stem cell therapy ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Measurable ', ' molecular signature ', ' molecular profile ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' Proliferating ', ' Resolution ', ' Transcript ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' Cancer cell line ', ' Cancer stem cell ', ' malignant stem cell ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' transcriptomics ', ' gene discovery ', ' discover genes ', ' public health relevance ', ' genome-wide ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' pancreatic cancer cells ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' single cell sequencing ', ' transcriptome ', ' ']",NHGRI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,F31,2016,33259,NC-04,-0.006031012889925936
"Single-cell multi-protein device for informative cellular function evaluation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ELISpot including its variant FLUOROSpot remains the mainstay to measure true secretion of single cells and to assess cellular function (e.g., immunity) in the pre-clinical and clinical settings. However, because it measures only one or two proteins per single cell and provides minimal biological information, it has limited utility for measuring cell biology and physiological functions at the systems level. Because a subset of the cells capable of producing multiple cytokines (up to 40), called polyfunctional cells, dominate the overall response but currently no commercial tools are available to quantify polyfunctional cells at the highly multiplexed level, representing a major barrier in both academic research and pharmaceutical industry to accurately quantify cellular immune responses. Thus, it is necessary to develop a technology that can measure an array of proteins from single cells, and will help address a host of important biological and biomedical questions ranging from immune cell function heterogeneity, stem cell differentiation, drug resistance, angiogenesis, to cell-cell communication networks. Also, this technology is of urgent need in biotech and pharmaceutical industry. To address these challenges, this technology needs to meet all three of the following requirements: (i) Single cell sensitivity, (ii) High multiplicity, and (iii) High content. IsoPlexi has a prototype hand-held technology that for the first time provides the ability to measure many (up to 42) secreted effector proteins at the single T-cell level. At the same time, this device in its envisioned form will be far less costly than existing single-cell instruments, representing a significant market advantage for wide-spread use in pre-clinical and clinical uses. When applied to, but not limited in, the immunotherapeutics space, our technology has the capability to (1) detect the broadest mechanism of action at the single immune cell level, and (2) quantify the effector function of activated T-cell response including polyfunctionality at a broad cellular leve to detect both effective response and potential toxicity (autoimmunity). With Phase 1 support, IsoPlexis plans to conduct the initial industrial R&D to turn this academic technology to a commercial product. We propose to: (1) develop a fully packaged single-cell protein secretion assay device to meet minimum commercial usability and validity standards; (2) develop computational pipelines and a software suite for automated data quantification and informatics. We expect to develop a user-friendly hardware and a software suite for reliable single cell multiplex protein secretion profiling and rapid data analysis.

"Development of mosaic mouse models of HCC for genetic interspecies inference DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a menace for human health for the lack of any effective treatment. HCC is usually the end result of chronic liver diseases associated with diverse risk factors. Furthermore, non- alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) induced HCC, which is projected to be the leading cause of new cases, remains poorly characterized. Although many mouse models of HCC have been developed, it is unclear how well they represent different subgroups of human HCCs. This research plan proposes to transform HCC animal modeling by establishing a novel in vivo platform to accurately replicate the somatic molecular profiles of human HCC in mice. To do this, three independent HCC mouse models will be exhaustively characterized through exome sequencing and gene expression profiling. Using bioinformatics techniques including machine- learning and network analysis, these datasets will be compared with human HCC datasets from TCGA and the ICGC to identify subgroups of patients with similar somatic molecular profiles to the HCC mouse models as well as refined minimum sets of characteristic genetic aberrations. A derived transposon system will be used to generate mosaic mouse models replicating human HCC genetic subgroups faithfully. These models will enable 1) experimental dissection of the molecular mechanisms underlying distinct etiologies of HCC, 2) systematic assessment of candidate HCC therapies and 3) investigation of therapeutic resistances. This K99/R00 career development award proposal describes a two-year mentored and three-year independent research program essential for the development of Dr. Font-Burgada as an independent investigator. Dr. Font-Burgada received his PhD at University of Barcelona, Spain, for the work he performed to investigate basic chromatin regulatory and epigenetic mechanisms. He then moved to University of California, San Diego where he joined Dr. Michael Karin's laboratory to train in mouse models of cancer and signal transduction. For the accomplishment of this research proposal, Dr. Font-Burgada has designed a strong training and career development plan consisting of: 1- the continued mentorship of Dr. Michael Karin to gain additional expertise in mouse models of HCC and signal transduction, 2- Training in bioinformatics, specifically in methods to identify cancer driver genetic aberrations and network-based approaches for comparative genomic analysis of mouse and human HCCs, to be overseen by co-mentor Dr. Hannah Carter, an Assistant Professor of Medicine, at UCSD. 3- Training in application of emerging transposon vector technologies to generate mosaic mouse models for in vivo analysis of oncogenic pathways. 4- Career development courses and seminars in a supportive academic environment in the Department of Pharmacology at UCSD to complement other aspects of the training program. This training plan will be overseen by an advisory committee comprising 4 members, mentor, co-mentor, and additional experts in mouse models of cancer and bioinformatics, Inder Verma and Trey Ideker, providing key scientific insights and essential guidance in critical steps in Dr. Font-Burgada transition to independence. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has a 5-year survival rate of less than 10% and leads to 700000 deaths globally each year. The genetic causes of this disease are poorly understood and the only available targeted therapy extends life expectancy by a mere 3 months. In order to improve these dismal statistics, I am developing a novel class of mouse models capable of reproducing the spectrum of mutations observed in a given human tumor, to enable study of HCC

"SPORE in Skin Cancer The incidence of melanoma has risen dramatically in recent years, but no therapy has improved overall survival for the majority of patients with unresectable metastatic disease. The University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute (UPCI) Melanoma and Skin Cancer Program (MSCP) will continue to conduct a Specialized Program of Research Excellence (SPORE) to improve our understanding of molecular and immunologic mechanisms of cancer progression and to validate prognostic and predictive biomarkers for personalized treatment of advanced melanoma and cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL). Of our 4 Projects, 1 is continued from the prior funding period, and 3 new projects have been derived from developmental research conducted in the last period; 1 of the prior SPORE projects will be continued with independent ROI funding. Our highly integrated approach leverages complementary expertise in melanoma, oncology, dermatology, immunology, biostatistics, bioinformatics, machine learning, genomics, proteomics, and biomarker discovery to test hypotheses central to the improvement of therapeutic outcome in skin cancers. Regardless of clinical outcomes, these Projects will also generate urgently needed mechanistic data to inform development of new therapeutic strategies and pathways through which to monitor relapse and progression. Our 4 Projects will evaluate: (1) the prognostic and predictive value of the pro-inflammatory response and markers of immune suppression in relation to ipilimumab and interferon (IFN)¿ adjuvant therapy (leveraging an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group-led adjuvant trial); (2) an engineered, 3-antigen dendritic cell vaccine and IFN¿ boost in patients with metastatic melanoma; (3) the safety and efficacy of vemurafenib modulation of immunotherapy with IFN¿2b in patients with metastatic melanoma; and (4) an entirely new personalized microneedle vaccination technology in patients with melanoma and CTCL. The Administrative Core (A) coordinates the clinical research and provides scientific and fiscal oversight of the entire SPORE. The Biospecimen Core (B) is housed in the UPCI Immunologic Monitoring and Cellular Products Laboratory, where all tissue banking, biospecimen processing, and immune assays are conducted. The Biostatistics Core (C) and Informatics Core (D) support all projects with data analysis and management, respectively. We will continue to solicit, review, and fund applications for the career development and developmental research programs, which in the prior funding period led to the design of a new full project in this application (Project 3)  and the promotion of career development recipients to co-investigators and a project leader. The goal of this application is to use a multi-disciplinary approach to improve outcomes in skin cancer and in particular, metastatic melanoma, a disease with a 15% 5-year survival rate. We will improve treatment and outcomes for skin cancer patients by identifying new ways to treat the disease based on the biology of the individual patient's tumor and new biomarkers that predict risk and response to therapy to prevent recurrence based on an individual patient's genetics and the tumor impact upon the microenvironment.",SPORE in Skin Cancer,9323323,P50CA121973,"['inhibitor ', '

"Improving Prediction of Medical Responsiveness and Clinical Outcomes in Crohn's Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a K23 career development award resubmission for Dr. Ryan Stidham, a gastroenterologist at the University of Michigan. Dr. Stidham's long-term career goal is to develop objective prognostics to personalize treatment decisions for patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The immediate goals of the proposal are to evaluate both analytic morphomics, an image analysis platform to quantify CT scan findings, and serum glycoproteomic profiles to predict therapeutic response in patients with Crohn's disease. Dr. Stidham's integrated research and career development plan align with goals of developing himself as a collaborative translational investigator, skilled in statistical analysis o large datasets, applying novel prognostics to improve clinical outcomes in Crohn's disease. Crohn's disease (CD) affects over 700,000 patients in the United States. Nearly 60% of CD patients require surgical resection for medically-unresponsive disease within 10 years of diagnosis. Frequently, patients present with deep bowel injury composed of both medically-responsive inflammatory and non- responsive fibrotic injury. Despite the presence of an inflammatory target, medical therapy may be futile and timely surgical management should be pursued. Further, strategies using early high-intensity immunosuppression to prevent future fibrostenotic disease are likely to over treat portions of the CD population. Therefore, therapeutic decisions are predicated on (1) the probability that existing disease activity will respond to medical therapy and (2) the probability of developing future fibrostenotic complications. Assessment using colonoscopy and surrogates of inflammation including imaging, blood, and stool-based biomarkers fail to provide comprehensive and quantitative assessments of bowel injury, including fibrosis. Despite its importance, there are no measures to account for deep bowel wall injury and intestinal fibrosis. This research proposal will utilize quantitative imaging findings of deep bowel injury in conjunction with blood-based biomarkers reflecting disease phenotypes to predict medical failure, defined as requiring future bowel resection, hospitalization, and prolonged steroid use. To achieve our imaging aims (Aim 1) we will use analytic morphomics, a computer image analysis method, to quantify body and bowel composition from over 4,000 CT-enterographies in a longitudinal 1200 patient CD cohort. In Aim 2, serum glycoproteome variance will be characterized in carefully phenotyped inflammatory and stricturing subjects to refine our preexisting biomarkers of fibrosis. We have demonstrated that variations of the serum glycoproteome reflect the degree of intestinal fibrosis present and expect that serum glycoproteomics can differentiate inflammatory from fibrotic phenotypes in CD. Optimized serum glycoproteome profiles will be used to predict future conversion from B1- inflammatory disease to B2/3 fibrostenotic disease in a pediatric prospective-inception cohort (RISK study). Aim 3 entails a prospective study combining analytic morphomics and serum glycoproteome profiles to predict therapeutic response and clinical outcomes; providing preliminary data for future R03/R01 studies. Dr. Stidham is a Lecturer of Medicine at the University of Michigan Division of Gastroenterology. He earned his medical degree from the University of Virginia (AOA), completed an internal medicine residency at the University of Pennsylvania, and was a T-32 research fellow at the University of Michigan (2011). His research background combines laboratory and clinical experience with Dr. Peter Higgins (primary mentor), focusing on novel biomarker development. Dr. Stidham has been awarded several prior grants for pilot work, including a MICHR-CTSA T32 Pilot Grant for Proteomics and a Crohn's and Colitis Foundation Career Development Award for ultrasound imaging research. He is in the process of completing a Masters program in Clinical Research Design and Statistical Analysis at the University of Michigan School of Public Health (matriculation in April 2015). He has published in several gastroenterology journals, presented research internationally, and has built the independent collaborations featured in this proposal. Central to this career development award, the candidate will leverage the expertise of several mentors and collaborators to develop deep foundational skillsets in analytic imaging, translational proteomics, bioinformatics, and machine learning methods. The University of Michigan houses a nationally recognized Inflammatory Bowel Disease Program, internationally recognized proteomics expertise, and a dedicated Analytic Morphomics Group focused on computational image analysis of organs. The mentored research training will be supplemented with focused graduate-level coursework in bioinformatics, medical image analysis, machine learning methodologies, and decision support systems provided through the University of Michigan Center for Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics and the School of Public Health. The Division of Gastroenterology and Department of Medicine have a history of strong support for Dr. Stidham and will provide the time, resources, and mentorship necessary to achieve his professional and research goals. The training provided through this career development award will be pivotal for the candidate's development as an independent translational investigator focused on individualizing therapeutic management. This research will provide the foundation for future collaborative studies to further develop these and other prognostic tools for the inflammatory bowel diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed work evaluates the capabilities of quantitative image analysis and serum glycoproteome profiles to predict the probability of medical response in Crohn's disease. Improved prediction of therapeutic response would tailor Crohn's disease management such that patients unlikely to benefit from medical therapy can proceed to timely surgical management and be spared

"Integrative Bioinformatics Approaches to Human Brain Genomics and Connectomics Project Summary (Abstract)  Human brain connectomics and imaging genomics are two emerging research fields enabled by recent advances in multi-modal neuroimaging and high throughput omics technologies. Integrating brain imaging genomics and connectomics holds great promise for a systematic characterization of both the human brain connectivity and the connectivity-based neurobiological pathway from its genetic architecture to its influences on cognition and behavior. Rich multi-modal neuroimaging data coupled with high density omics data are available from large-scale landmark studies such as the NIH Human Connectome Project (HCP) and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). The unprecedented scale and complexity of these data sets, however, have presented critical computational bottlenecks requiring new concepts and enabling tools.  To bridge the gap, this project is proposed to develop and validate novel integrative bioinformatics approaches to human brain genomics and connectomics, and has three aims. Aim 1 is to develop a novel computational pipeline for a systematic characterization of structural connectome optimized for imaging genomics, where special consideration will be taken to address important issues including reliable tractography and network construction, systematic extraction of network attributes, identification of important network components (e.g., hubs, communities and rich clubs), prioritization of network attributes towards genomic analysis, and identification of outcome-relevant network measures. Aim 2 is to develop novel bioinformatics strategies to determining genetic basis of structural connectome, including novel approaches for analyzing graph-based phenotype data and learning outcome-relevant associations, and an ensemble of effective learning modules to handle a comprehensive set of scenarios on mining genome-connectome associations at the genome-wide connectome-wide scale. Aim 3 is to develop a visual analytic software system for interactive visual exploration and mining of fiber-tracts and brain networks with their genetic determinants and functional outcomes, where new visualization and exploration methods will be implemented for seamlessly combining human expertise and machine intelligence to enable novel contextually meaningful discoveries.  This project is expected to produce novel bioinformatics algorithms and tools for comprehensive joint analysis of large scale genomics and connectomics data. The availability of these powerful methods and tools is critical for full knowledge discovery and exploitation of major connectomics and imaging genomics initiatives such as HCP and ADNI. In addition, they can also help enable new computational applications in many other biomedical research areas where integrative analysis of connectomics and genomics data are of interest.

"Precision Medicine by Targeting Cell Adhesion in Melanoma PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In the proposed research, we address a problem that is common not just to melanoma, but also to other forms of cancer, such as prostate cancer, and that has been widely discussed recently. While we as dermatologists encourage patients to undergo skin cancer screening exams to detect melanoma early, it remains challenging to differentiate the truly aggressive from the indolent or nonclinical pigmented lesions. This is true even after a melanoma has been biopsied and examined under the microscope. As a result, there is massive over-diagnosis and overtreatment, specifically with respect to sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsies, that is costly, has side effects, requires precious hospital infrastructure and induces substantial patient anxiety. Surprisingly, and despite decades of research on cancer, assessment of metastasis risk in primary cutaneous melanoma continues to be based primarily on tumor invasion depth (also referred to Breslow depth), a method that was introduced 45 years go. While Breslow depth tends to work well at the extreme ends of the spectrum, most melanomas fall into a grey zone where Breslow depth with or without additional tissue-derived and clinical variables (such as patient age) does not predict the true biology of melanoma well. Breslow depth continues to be popular because alternative methods, including molecular-based methods, are either ineffective, have not been appropriately validated or lack a strong biological rationale. This in turn inhibits the development of new and innovative therapies. Here we will study a method that quantifies changes in integrin-linked cell adhesion to better differentiate high-risk (defined as SLN positive melanoma) from biologically indolent melanoma. First, we will study consecutive cases of cutaneous melanoma from across the United States and Europe and correlate a molecular profile of cell adhesion with SLN status. Second, we will study how the inhibition of certain aspects of integrin adhesion affects melanoma growth and metastasis in vivo. We expect that our research will validate methods to identify high-risk melanoma that outperform the standard of care, reduce the rate of unnecessary SLN procedures and identify patients with high-risk melanoma overlooked by current procedures. Moreover, a better understanding of the molecular machinery that drives metastasis will create new therapeutic opportunities. The candidate’s long term goal is discover novel characteristics of malignant melanocytes that enable the development of new and innovative diagnostic methods and therapies. The mentored career development award will help the candidate acquire new methodological, professional and leadership skills to independently, successfully and meaningfully contribute to the fields of cell adhesion/cancer/melanoma research in the years to come. Specifically, the plan is to pursue the following training activities: 1.) Acquire expertise in studying melanoma using mouse models; use these models to test and optimize drugs and drugs combinations. 2.) Acquire experience in interpreting the histological features of melanoma; broaden my understanding of the biological concepts used by dermatopathologists to characterize melanoma. 3.) Acquire expertise in designing diagnostic biomarker studies; learn statistical methods, specifically methods that can be used to analyze complex datasets. 4.) Build the professional and leadership skills to bring together and lead an international consortium of melanoma investigators. The candidate will be mentored by a team of national experts in the field of cancer research. Mentoring and research will be carried out at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN. Mayo Clinic offers core facility services for all mainstream standardized biomedical research methods. This includes tissue archives and bio-banking, animal housing and animal care, optical imaging, including high-end confocal microscopes, all methods related to histology, including RNA and DNA in-situ hybridization, targeted gene expression-based methods including microfluidic Fluidigm technology, and all mainstream ‘omics’ methods. All services are fully staffed with trained technicians. Moreover, there is scientific staff available to trouble-shoot experiments. These resources are all within walking distance from the candidate’s laboratory. Moreover, Mayo Clinic has a large staff of medical indexers, software programmers, application specialist and bio-information scientists. Because of the size of the clinic, there are medical specialists and subspecialists on hand for all areas of medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE While dermatologists encourage patients to undergo skin cancer screening exams to detect melanoma early, it remains challenging to differentiate the truly aggressive from the indolent pigmented lesion.

"Development of tools for site-directed analysis of gene function The overarching goal of this application is to create tools and efficient methods to define genes that can promote human health. While a tremendous amount of data has been cataloged on gene mutation and changes in gene expression associated with complex human disease, our understanding of those genes that could be co-opted to restore patient health is lacking. To address this need and test for genes that when restored to wild type function promote health, we propose develop mutagenic, revertible and conditional alleles that provide spatial and temporal control of gene expression. The ability to make site-specific, untagged mutant alleles in zebrafish and other models has been greatly advanced by custom nucleases that include TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9 systems. These systems operate on the same principle: they are designed to bind to specific sequences in the genome and create a double strand break. The goals of this proposal leverage the activities of TALEN and CRISPR/Cas9 technologies to make site-specific double strand breaks. First, we propose to develop a suite of vectors to make integration alleles that are highly mutagenic and allow production of conditional and revertible alleles. Second, we propose to develop methods to generate predictable alleles in zebrafish at TALEN- and CRISPR/Cas9-induced double strand break sites by invoking the microhomology mediated end-joining pathway. Third, leveraging our preliminary data, we propose to improve methods for homology directed repair with oligonucleotides to create disease associated alleles in zebrafish and for site-specific integration using homologous recombination at TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9 cut sites. Fourth, we propose use single-strand annealing at TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9 cut sites to promote precise transgene integration to make tagged and highly mutagenic allele. These tools and techniques will have direct implications for providing precise gene editing techniques to assess the roles of genes in disease and their ability to promote health following disease progression. While we will develop these methodologies in zebrafish due to their ease of gene delivery, we anticipate these methodologies will not only enhance the efficiency of gene editing but will be readily adaptable for use in other model organisms and large animals. In our opinion, this will have important implications for modeling human disease and health in animal systems by greatly enhancing the ability to make predictible alleles, small nucleotide polymorphisms similar to those associated with human disease, and conditional alleles to test for the ability of a gene to restore health. The central goal for this application is to define genes that can promote or restore human health. For this, we propose to develop efficient integration of highly mutagenic and conditional cassettes into genes in a site-directed manner. The strategies proposed employ the ability of designer nucleases to create DNA double strand breaks and to site-specifically direct biochemical activities to genes of interest. The technologies developed will have important implications for modeling human disease in animal systems.",Development of tools for site-directed analysis of gene function,9276155,R24OD020166,"['Allelomorphs ', ' Alleles ', ' Animals ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Communities ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Embryonic ', ' Embryo ', ' Gene Expression ', ' genetic therapy ', ' gene-based therapy ', ' Genetic Intervention ', ' Gene-Tx ', ' Gene Transfer Procedure ', ' Gene Transfer Clinical ', ' Gene Therapy Molecular Biology ', ' DNA Therapy ', ' gene therapy ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Laboratories ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Microinjections ', ' Biological Models ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Nucleotides ', ' Oligonucleotides ', ' oligos ', ' Oligo ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Patients ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' polymorphism ', ' Production ', ' Proteins ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publishing ', ' Reagent ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Work ', ' Zebra Fish ', ' Zebra Danio ', ' Danio rerio ', ' Brachydanio rerio ', ' Zebrafish ', ' recombinase ', ' Generations ', ' Mutagenesis Molecular Biology ', ' Genetics-Mutagenesis ', ' Mutagenesis ', ' Mediating ', ' Custom ', ' method development ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' repair ', ' repaired ', ' Biochemical ', ' insight ', ' Recovery ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Systems Integration ', ' Collaborations ', ' Transgenes ', ' gene function ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Catalogs ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' Gene Mutation ', ' Gene Alteration ', ' mutant ', ' nuclease ', ' homologous recombination ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' Modeling ', ' functional genomics ', ' Genomics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Binding ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Regenerative Medicine ', ' Address ', ' DNA Double Strand Break ', ' Data ', ' Mutate ', ' gene modification ', ' Gene-Modified ', ' Validation ', ' Modification ', ' Gene Delivery ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Operating System ', ' vector ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Genome engineering ', ' site-specific integration ', ' human disease ', ' therapeutic target ', ' induced pluripotent stem cell ', ' iPSCs ', ' iPSC ', ' iPS ', ' tool development ', ' therapeutic development ', ' therapeutic agent development ', ' CRISPR/Cas technology ', ' Cas nuclease technology ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 ', ' CRISPR/Cas method ', ' CRISPR-CAS-9 ', ' CRISPR technology ', ' CRISPR technique ', ' CRISPR method ', ' transcription activator-like effector nucleases ', ' TALENs ', ' TALEN technology ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' ']",OD,IOWA STATE UNIVERSITY,R24,2017,706555,IA-04,-0.007549041916967939
"Center for Environmental Genetics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)        It is a priority of the CEG and the Career Development Program to identify and develop the careers of promising early stage investigators. To accomplish this goal, the overall objective of the career development program (CDP) is to recruit, enrich, encourage, and provide resources and mentoring activities to investigators at the graduate, postgraduate and early faculty levels with a particular emphasis on environmental health science. The CDP has forged new cross-disciplinary partnerships in areas applicable to environmental health science with basic, epidemiological, and/or clinical studies including studies in molecular genetics and environmental epidemiology and environmental toxicology.  To accomplish the overall objective, the CDP has developed a highly innovative approach with three specific.  Aim 1 is to attract, recruit and promote opportunities for junior faculty (within three years from initial appointment) towards development of an independent career interfacing between basic, translational or clinical investigations with application to environmental health science. The Next Generation Biomedical Investigator (NGBI) program is the principal mechanism for achieving this aim.  Aim 2 is to identify investigators with less experience (novice investigators) who are still in trainin with minimal experience but have an interest in examining the intricate role of environmental health science in health and disease. Recruits include physicians in their academic fellowship i.e. post residency, who are obtaining an MS or Ph.D, mentored postdoctoral Ph.D. fellows or advanced (third or fourth year) pre-doctoral research students. This aim is achieved by supplementing novice investigators' training with research resources, mentoring and career development opportunities through the New Investigator Scholar (NIS) pathway.  Aim 3 is to enrich training/scientific experiences, promote career opportunities and networking experiences, activities integrated with the Administrative and other CEG cores. The objective is to develop NGBIs and NISs and others new to environmental health science by enriching experiences as an investigator and eventually independent scientist.

"Multimodal Biomarkers in Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K01 award will support my development as an independent investigator with a translational research program that specializes in the cognitive and biological basis of neurodegenerative diseases such as frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Candidate: My research experience as a cognitive neuroscientist ideally positions me to achieve my career goal of becoming an independent investigator with expertise on the cognitive and biological basis of neurodegenerative disease. I have strong cognitive training with an M.Sc in Psycholinguistics and Ph.D in Psychology from the University of Edinburgh, where I was supported by an NRSA Individual Predoctoral Award. During my postdoctoral IGERT fellowship at the Institute for Research in Cognitive Science at the University of Pennsylvania, I was awarded an NRSA Individual Postdoctoral Fellowship Award to investigate the role of decision-making in language. In this research I have gained experience investigating neurodegenerative disease patients comparatively in order to obtain converging evidence to complement fMRI studies of healthy adults. I have become increasingly interested in translating my research to optimize the diagnosis and treatment of patients with neurodegenerative diseases. I was recently award the Society for the Neurobiology of Language Postdoctoral Merit Award in recognition of my novel research investigating how social limitations in patients contribute to difficulty in discourse. I have committed to four years of clinical research the NIH Loan Repayment Program, and I intend to commit to clinical research for the duration of my career. I have learned that cognitive and neuroimaging studies provide only one perspective on neurodegenerative diseases. In this proposal, I plan to gain the necessary expertise in biological aspects of FTLD and related conditions to complement my past experiences, and thus achieve my goal of becoming a multifaceted independent investigator with expertise in the cognitive and biological basis for neurodegenerative diseases. With the support of this K01, I will develop expertise to conduct investigations of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), genetic, and neuropathological aspects of neurodegenerative diseases. I will ultimately integrate the biological expertise gained in this proposal with language studies from my cognitive neuroscience research in an effort to identify non-invasive biomarkers that can be used to screen patients for clinical trials and to measure the efficacy of disease-modifying agents. Environment: This award will be conducted at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in the Department of Neurology, the Center for Neurodegenerative Disease Research (CNDR), and the Penn Bioinformatics Center where I have strong institutional support. The proposed institution is an exceptional environment that has expert centers for neuroimaging, cerebrospinal fluid biomarker analysis, a leading genetic research core, expert neuropathology, outstanding biostatisical support, and relevant clinical research laboratories. The University of Pennsylvania is unique in comparison to other institutions in the country because all of the above methods are available in one center. My mentor, Dr. Murray Grossman, and my co-mentor, Dr. John Trojanowksi, have international reputations for neurodegenerative disease research. My career development will also be supported by my co-mentor, Dr. Lyle Ungar, who has extensive expertise in statistical learning algorithms and in the analysis of proteomic and genomics datasets. Together, this mentorship team will facilitate my development as an independent investigator by providing access to existing and future collaborators, laboratory resources, and exceptional training environments. The CNDR is a world- leading center for neurodegenerative disease research with human and animal models of disease and exceptional translational science. Biofluid biomarker experience is extensive, and several national biofluid cores are centered at Penn (e.g. ADNI). There is a wealth of internationally-recognized neuroimaging expertise at the University of Pennsylvania in the Penn Imaging and Computer Science Laboratory, and I will benefit by integrating neuroimaging resources from these facilities with other modalities of biomarker research. Training: I will develop my expertise in the biological basis of neurodegenerative disease with the support of my mentor, Dr. Murray Grossman, and my co-mentors, Dr. John Trojanowski and Dr. Lyle Ungar. Specifically, with Dr. Trojanowksi I will engage in training related to biofluid and genetic biomarkers of FTLD. I will develop advanced neuroimaging skills and cutting-edge biostatistical methods with Dr. Ungar. Each of these training modalities will be supported by complementary formal coursework, participation in seminars, attendance of conferences, and regularly scheduled meetings with mentorship team. Research: FTLD is a neurodegenerative disease affecting approximately 15 out of 100,000 individuals. In recent years detailed neuropathological investigations at autopsy have demonstrated distinct sources of histopathological abnormalities in FTLD, including the presence of tau inclusions (FTLD-tau) and TDP-43 proteinopathies (FTLD-TDP). However, there are currently no in vivo methods for discriminating between FTLD-tau and FTLD-TDP. There is an urgent need to improve the in vivo diagnosis of FTLD to appropriately enter patients into emerging clinical trials, and to develop sensitive and specific endpoints in trials that can quantify response to these treatments. The overall research aim of this proposal is to develop multimodal methods to improve in vivo diagnosis of FTLD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) affects approximately 15 out of 100,000 adults. Detailed neuropathological investigations at autopsy have identified two distinct sources of histopathological changes that contribute to FTLD. However, there are currently no in vivo methods for diagnosing pathological subtypes of FTLD. There is an urgent need to identify in vivo diagnosis methods to facilitate the identification of appropriate patients to enter into emerging disease-modifying drug treatment trials. The overall aim of this project is to identify multimodal biomarkers of FTLD.",Multimodal Biomarkers in Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration,9279038,K01AG043503,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+

"An Integrative Bioinformatics Approach to Study Single Cancer Cell Heterogeneity DESCRIPTION:  My long term career goal is to become a leading expert in translational bioinformatics who creates, develops and applies computational and statistical methods to reveal landscapes of cancers and to identify strategies to cure cancers. Human cancers are highly heterogeneous. Such heterogeneity is the major source of the ultimate failure of most cancer agents. However, due to the limit of technologies, the intercellular heterogeneity has not been investigated genome wide, at single-cell level until recently. New technologies such as single-cell transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) and exome have revealed new insights and more profound complexity than was previously thought. However, so far these technologies are limited to one assay per cell. It remains a grand challenge to perform multiple, integrative assays from the same single tumor cell, in particular, from those derived from small tumor biopsies. Given the stochasticity at the single cell resolution, reproducibility and sensitivity ar daunting tasks. To overcome this challenge, I have started the single cancer cell sequencing analysis project, in collaboration with Dr. Sherman Weissman at Yale University, who is also my co-mentor of this K01 proposal. My immediate career goal is to identify genome-wide heterogeneity among single cancer cells, using the erythroleukemia K562 cell line. Towards this, I am proposing a research project on an integrative bioinformatics approach to analyze multiple types of genomics data generated from the same single leukemia cells, a timely and critical topic. Specifically, I am interested in studying the following specific aims: (1) buildinga bioinformatics pipeline to study heterogeneity of single-cell RNA-Seq, (2) building a bioinformatics pipeline to study CpG methylome of single cells, (3) building a bioinformatics pipeline to study single-cell Exome-Seq, and (4) integrate the RNA-Seq, methylome and Exome-Seq data generated from the same single cells. These single cells genomic data are provided by Dr. Sherman Weissman's lab from 30 single K562 erythroleukemia cells. I will first construct and validate in parallel, the RNA-Seq, methylome, and Exome-Seq bioinformatics pipelines optimized for single-cell analysis, and then develop and validate an integrative platform to analyze these multiple types of high-throughput data. To accomplish the research project, and to successfully transit from a junior faculty to an expert of the field, I have developed a career plan with my mentoring committee composed of four world-class experts in different fields relevant to Big Data Science: Primary Mentor Dr. Jason Moore in Bioinformatics from Dartmouth College, Co-mentor Dr. Sherman Weissman in Single-cell Genomics and Genetics from Yale University, Co-mentor Dr. Herbert Yu in Cancer Epidemiology from University of Hawaii Cancer Center and Co-mentor Dr. Jason Leigh in Big Data Visualization from the Information and Computer Science Department of University of Hawaii Manoa. I will primarily work with my four co-mentors for planning the development of my career during this award. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this K01 proposal is to integrate multiple types of high-throughput data, in particular, the transcriptome, exome-sequencing and CpG methylome data generated from single cancer cells.

"The HMS Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology PROJECT SUMMARY  Systems and computational biologists, physician-scientists, pharmacologists, biochemists and cell biologists will collaborate in a new Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology (LSP) to apply a measure-model approach to understanding the mechanisms of action of therapeutic drugs in multiple disease areas. The LSP will pioneer the development of quantitative network-centric approaches to pharmacology and toxicology that include analysis of dose-time-response relationships at a single-cell level, modeling of cellular network dynamics and their perturbation by drugs, development of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic models in mouse and ultimately in man and use of systematic approaches to identify and qualify new drug targets. Our approach combines mathematical modeling with empirical measurement (including work with clinical samples and data) and aims to create quantitative and predictive drug response models at different temporal and physical scales. We aim to reinvigorate pharmacology and toxicology as foundational disciplines of translational medicine, develop the conceptual underpinning for personalized and precision medicine and lower the cost of drug discovery by improving its predictability. Close interactions with industry and the FDA will help address the productivity gap in drug discovery and development. The LSP is innovative with respect to its goal of using problems in basic and translational pharmacology to link three disciplines (cell and molecular biology, computational biology and medicine) and its aim of advancing therapeutic science in the Boston area and beyond. Students and postdocs supervised by 18 faculty members, 2 independent postdoctoral fellows and two PhD-level staff from 7 institutions will work in immediate proximity in a new custom-designed laboratory. The lab will host a new graduate program in therapeutics and multi-factored outreach activities that will promote systems pharmacology internationally.  These goals will be achieved through four inter-linked research programs (Aims 1-4), a core dedicated to efficient translation of LSP research (Aim 5), an education core and administrative/outreach activities (Aims 6-8). Aim 1 will focus on the determinants of dose-response at a single-cell level, including the role of cell-to-cell variability in fractional response and of timing and order-of-exposure in combination therapy. Aim 2 will take a network-level approach to understanding therapeutic, toxic and paradoxical drug responses by kinase inhibitors in three types of cancer. The mechanistic basis and consequences of poly-pharmacology will also be examined along with differential drug responsiveness by normal and diseased tissues. Aim 3 will address PK-PD by developing multi-scale models of drug actions at the level of cells, tissues and organisms and new methods for measuring drug distribution at the cellular and subcellular levels. Aim 4 will apply machine learning and causal reasoning to target discovery from clinical records in asthma, inflammatory disease and fibrosis and pursue a structure-guided approach to identifying regulators of ""undruggable "" targets. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The computational biologists, physician-scientists and pharmacologists in the Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology will apply a combined measure-model approach to understanding the mechanisms of action of therapeutic drugs in multiple disease areas. They will develop and apply new tools to (i) investigate the factors that determine the therapeutic index of drugs at a single cell level and in tissues (ii) apply knowledge of cellulr networks to develop a rational approach to combination therapy (iii) identify and qualify new drug targets for significant unmet medical needs. Success with our approach will advance personalized medicine and reduce the frequency of late-stage failure in drug discovery, thereby reducing the cost of new medicines.",The HMS Laboratory of

"Training in lesion-symptom mapping for speech-language research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Training in lesion-symptom mapping for speech-language research Abstract: Researchers rely upon the lesion method to evaluate the speech-language status of stroke survivors and draw inferences about underlying brain function. This use of neuropsychology is highly valued in basic speech- language research because it can support causal inferences about brain structure/function relationships. Crucially, advances in analytic techniques and brain image computing are creating a new landscape for neuropsychological research. In this new landscape, the lesion method represents a form of big-data science that requires large sample sizes and complex image computing to implement lesion-symptom mapping (LSM) across the entire brain, without prior regions of interest. Expertise in these new techniques is becoming critical for high impact speech-language research. The career enhancement plan will provide the candidate with training in cutting-edge LSM. The candidate is an established speech-language investigator with a basic program of multidisciplinary research that includes populations with communication disorders due to stroke. The career enhancement will come at an ideal point, because it will build on the candidate's success in establishing an open-access research registry of stroke survivors (the Western Pennsylvania Patient Registry, WPPR), and current work to develop and validate collaborative videoconferencing for remote neuropsychological assessment. These efforts have created the recruitment pool and datasets that are needed for LSM. The career enhancement will provide the training needed to leverage these resources, thereby augmenting the candidate's program of research and career trajectory. The overarching objectives are to: (1) retool the skills of the candidate to infuse LSM into her program of speech-language research, (2) seed data sharing and data science partnerships to boost the candidate's leadership of WPPR as a national resource, and (3) advance understanding of LSM methods and the neural substrates for speech and language to improve the knowledge base of the candidate and other investigators. The candidate proposes a synergistic set of activities. Didactic activities will give training in machie learning and brain image computing, scholarly travel experiences will afford opportunities to network with speech-language researchers and data scientists whose work is relevant for LSM, and two research studies will provide a hands-on opportunity for the candidate to acquire, apply, and extend LSM methods under the guidance of a superb mentoring team. Study 1 will use univariate and multivariate LSM analysis to investigate the neural substrates of chronic Broca's aphasia and the factors that influence the reproducibility of LSM results. Study 2 will develop and evaluate a workflow for automated lesion segmentation, using a software platform (3D Slicer) that involves two NIH-supported data science centers. Overall, the career enhancement will retool the skills, research network, and knowledge base of an established investigator, allowing the candidate to significantly augment her program of speech-language research and advance the utility of WPPR as a national resource for speech-language research.

"EMR-Linked Biobank for Translational Genomics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medical care informed by genomic information is beginning to move into clinical practice. The Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network through its initial phases has provided much of the groundwork for this transformation. The Geisinger Health System project, ""EMR-Linked Biobank for Translational Genomics"" intends to build on the knowledge and experience from eMERGE phase II to accelerate discovery and implementation while expanding our understanding of the sociocultural implications of genomics in medicine. We will accomplish this goal through three specific aims: 1) Use existing biospecimens, genotype and sequence data and EMR-generated phenotypes for discovery in the proposed disorders: familial hypercholesterolemia and chronic rhinosinusitis, 2) Develop and test approaches for implementation of genomic information in clinical practice, 3) Explore, develop and implement novel approaches for family-centered communication around clinically relevant genomic results. We currently have over 60,000 patients broadly consented for research with a large and increasing proportion consented for return of results and deposition in the electronic health record. Over 18,000 patients are genotyped on high density platforms. Our two proposed phenotypes, familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) were chosen because both conditions have a significant public health impact in the United States, but they are also ideally suited to the specific aims of the project. They provide opportunities for innovation and extension of current eMERGE methods. While many of these innovations will take advantage of the sequencing done as part of the project, there are several other areas emphasized in the funding opportunity that will broaden the scope of eMERGE research. One of the areas of emphasis for eMERGE III is exploring the familial return of actionable results. FH is well suited to this, as the current clinical recommendation is cascade testing of family members for all diagnosed patients. Currently this relies on the patient to contact at risk family members, but this is less than optimal. We will explore this issue using qualitative and quantitative methods and use the results to design and test novel family communication strategies. Gene-environment interactions play an important role in the development and severity of disease. These are very difficult to study. We propose novel approaches that leverage the assets of Geisinger Health System and the eMERGE Network to develop and apply methods to extend existing projects that study the impact of environment on CRS. This would include the first large scale environment-wide association studies (EWAS). Finally, we propose to lead efforts to apply the tools of economic modeling and analysis to eMERGE projects to begin to quantify the value of implementation of genomic medicine in the US healthcare system. These proposed innovations will magnify the already significant impact that the eMERGE program has had in moving genomic medicine from a dream to a reality.

"HERCULES: Exposome Research Center PROJECT SUMMARY: HERCULES The vision of the HERCULES P30 is to demonstrably advance the role of environmental health sciences in clinical and public health settings using the platform of the exposome. Healthcare and biomedical research have become increasingly genome-centric. While much of this is due to the impressive achievements in genomics, which have consistently outpaced gains in environmental health, it is our contention that a more persuasive case needs to be made for environmental factors. Science and intuition support the idea that the environment plays just as large of a role as genetics for the majority of diseases. The exposome, which embraces a strategy and scale similar to genomic research, is poised to elevate the environment in discussions of health and disease. We will continue to grow and enhance the environmental health science research portfolio at Emory through cutting-edge technologies and innovative data solutions. We will build upon the superb relationships we have built with the local community and continue to push the mission of NIEHS on campus and across the scientific landscape. Based on the extraordinary progress over our first three years, we propose to retain our theme to use exposome-related concepts and approaches to improve human health. This simple and unifying vision will continue to stimulate discovery, promote collaboration, and enhance communication through the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. To marshal physical and intellectual resources to support exposome-related approaches (high-resolution metabolomics, analytical chemistry, systems biology, machine learning, bioinformatics, high-throughput toxicology, and spatial and temporal statistical models) through cores, pilot funding, mentoring, and research forums. Specific Aim 2. To make major contributions towards exposome and environmental health science research. Specific Aim 3. To provide career development activities around innovative and emerging concepts and approaches related to the exposome. Specific Aim 4. To enhance and expand existing relationships with community partners to resolve environmental health issues in the community using exposome principles. Specific Aim 5. To provide infrastructure and resources to facilitate rapid translation of novel scientific findings into the development of prevention and treatment strategies in humans. Pursuit of HERCULES' aims will advance environmental health sciences within our institutions and in the scientific community.

"Elucidating the Role of the Genetic and Environmental Determinants of Preterm Birth Using Integrative Computational Approaches ABSTRACT Given the wealth and availability of genomic and environmental exposure data, computational methods provide a powerful opportunity to identify population-specific determinants of disease. Proper treatment of data types emerging from a diverse set of molecular and environmental profiling technologies cannot be analyzed using traditional statistical routines and new computational approaches are needed. In line with the President's Precision Medicine Initiative, the goal of this proposal is to develop computational methods and integrate large- scale genetic and environmental exposure datasets to elucidate factors that affect preterm birth (PTB) in diverse populations. Preterm birth, or the delivery of an infant prior to 37 weeks of gestation, is a major health concern. Infants born prematurely, comprising of about 12% of the US newborns, have elevated risks of neonatal mortality and a wide array of health problems. Preterm birth rates vary among different ethnic groups, with frequencies significantly elevated in African Americans and moderately elevated in Hispanics in comparison to Europeans. Environmental and socioeconomic factors alone may not explain these disparities and despite the evidence for a genetic basis to preterm birth, to date no causal genetic variants have been identified. In this proposal I aim to leverage the rich genetic and environmental variation data and develop computational approaches to advance our understanding of biology of preterm birth as it relates to all populations. To that extent, I propose three aims. In aim 1, I will develop computational methods to identify and validate novel genetic factors for preterm birth by genome-wide association (GWA) study in diverse ethnic populations. I obtained a comprehensive set of publicly available PTB case and control datasets consisting of ethnically diverse mothers and babies including 3,500 cases and nearly 16,000 controls from dbGAP and will carry out an ancestry-based case-control GWA study to identify genetic factors influencing PTB. In aim 2, I will develop analytical methodology to identify environmental and socioeconomic factors that impact preterm birth in diverse ethnic populations. I propose to integrate linked California State databases covering over 3 million births across diverse populations with geographical location data and pollution levels and UV exposure data from the Environmental Protection Agency in order to identify whether these exposures play a role in contributing to population-specific PTB risk. In aim 3, I will carry out integrative data analysis and build computational models in order to identify population specific interactions between the genetic and environmental factors affecting PTB risk. I hypothesize that gene-environment interactions contribute to population differences in preterm birth risk following environmental exposures. The proposed work will allow us to learn more about the etiology PTB, but could also be extended to other phenotypes of interest. This project is the logical next step for the study of the interaction of genetics and environment in the context of disease, which can be used to inform precise population-specific diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.

"Developing Risk Algorithms of Internalizing Disorder Etiology and Course ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Anxiety and mood disorders (internalizing disorders [IDs]) are common and debilitating conditions. The proposed Career Development Award will provide the candidate with the necessary skills to develop an independent research program focused on identifying how psychological/personality, environmental, and biomarker vulnerabilities predict the development and course of IDs using prospective observational survey designs. The applicant's prior research training involved studying the influence of psychological/personality vulnerabilities on ID severity and course in patient samples. In order to expand his research program, the applicant is seeking advanced training in two key areas (psychiatric epidemiology; machine learning methods) and supplemental training in two additional areas (self-assessed biomarkers; environmental vulnerabilities). Collectively, this training will provide the applicant with the skills (1) to study ID onset and course using prospective survey designs, and (2) to use machine learning methods to develop clinically-useful risk algorithms of ID onset and course using multiple vulnerability domains (psychological/ personality; environmental; biomarker). These skills will be developed through a combination of didactic training, guided readings, and mentored research projects. Training will occur in the Department of Health Care Policy at Harvard Medical School under the mentoring of Dr. Ronald Kessler (an expert in psychiatric epidemiology) and Dr. Sherri Rose (an expert in machine learning). The proposed research plan involves two phases. In Phase 1, machine learning methods will be used to analyze cross-sectional ID data from the World Mental Health (WMH) Surveys in order to develop risk algorithms that predict the onset of major depression, bipolar disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder (Specific Aim 1). Machine learning methods will also be applied to WMH Survey data to develop subtypes of bipolar disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder that maximize the prediction of their long-term course (Specific Aim 2). The proposed Phase 1 studies are highly innovative; in contrast to other areas of medicine, virtually no studies have attempted to develop ID risk algorithms or subtypes using machine learning methods. However, Phase 1 studies are also preliminary; replication and expansion of the algorithms is needed in prospective samples. Accordingly, Phase 2 of the research plan (Specific Aim 3) aims to test the feasibility of conducting a large prospective web-based survey study of psychological/personality (assessed via self-report and behavior), environmental (assessed via self-report), and biomarker (assessed via self-administered salivary assays) vulnerabilities of ID onset and course. Participants will be recruited online to complete a baseline survey and those determined to have an ID or be at high-risk of developing an ID will be asked to complete bimonthly follow-ups over the course of one year. The Phase 2 study is also innovative. Despite being called ""the future"" of epidemiological research, web-based survey studies of the IDs are rare. In addition, existing prospective epidemiological studies coarsely (i.e., dichotomously) assess IDs and their vulnerabilities, and have long gaps (1-4 years) between follow-ups. The use of bimonthly online surveys of the severity of IDs and their vulnerabilities will address these limitations. Phase 2 exploratory analyses will also be conduct in which latent ID trajectories are predicted using machine learning methods. Overall, the outlined training activities and mentored research projects will be used to develop an R01 application for a prospective epidemiological study that uses machine learning methods to develop clinically useful algorithms of ID onset and course using a broad range of psychological/personality, environmental, and biomarker vulnerabilities factors. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research aims to use cutting-edge statistical methods to develop clinically-useful (1) risk algorithms to identify who is at greatest risk of developing different internalizing disorders, and (2) subtypes of internalizing disorders that identify who is most likely to experience a persistence and chronic long-term disorder course. This research has important clinical and public health implications.

"A BRAIN Initiative Resource: The Neuroscience Multi-omic Data Archive Project Summary The Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative promotes the development and application of technologies to describe the temporal and spatial dynamics of cell types and neural circuits in the brain. The Principal Investigator, senior personnel and staff of this project have diverse expertise required to marshall data across the BRAIN Initiative consortium, including experience in data collection from multiple institutions, large-scale quality control and analysis processing capability, familiarity with NIH policy and public archive deposition strategies. To promote smooth interactions across a large research consortium, we will develop the Neuroscience Multi-Omic Archive (NeMO Archive), a data repository that is specifically focused on the storage and dissemination of omic data from the BRAIN Initiative and related brain research projects. We will utilize a federated model for data storage such that the physical location of data can be distributed between the NeMO local file system, public repositories, and a cloud-based storage system (e.g. Amazon S3). We will leverage this capability and distribute BRAIN Initiative data between our local filesystem and the cloud. The Nemo Archive will be a data resource consistent with the principles advanced by research community members who are launching resources in next generation NIH data ecosystem. These practices include FAIR Principles, documentation of APIs, data-indexing systems, workflow sharing, use of shareable software pipelines and storage on cloud-based systems. The information incorporating into the NeMO archive will, in part, enable understanding of 1) genomic regions associated with brain abnormalities and disease; 2) transcription factor binding sites and other regulatory elements; 3) transcription activity; 4) levels of cytosine modification; and 5) histone modification profiles and chromatin accessibility. It will enable users to answer diverse questions of relevance to brain research, such as identifying diagnostic candidates, predicting prognosis, selecting treatments, and testing hypotheses. It will also provide the basic knowledge to guide the development and execution of predictive and machine learning algorithms in the future.   Project Narrative The Neuroscience Multi-Omic Archive (NeMO Archive) is a data repository that is specifically focused on the storage and dissemination of omic data from the BRAIN Initiative and related brain research projects.",A BRAIN Initiative Resource: The Neuroscience Multi-omic Data Archive,9413774,R24MH114788,"['Algorithms ', ' Archives ', ' Atlases ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Combining Site ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Chromatin ', ' Communities ', ' Cytosine ', ' Data Collection ', ' Elements ', ' Future ', ' indexing ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Patients ', ' Personnel Staffing ', ' Phenotype ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prognosis ', ' Quality Control ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Running ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Standardization ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' transcription factor ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Ecological Systems ', ' Ecologic Systems ', ' Ecosystem ', ' Visualization ', ' Imagery ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Ensure ', ' Ingestion ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Policies ', ' data storage ', ' data retrieval ', ' Data Storage and Retrieval ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' Deposition ', ' Deposit ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' cell type ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Services ', ' data management ', ' experience ', ' Familiarity ', ' member ', ' neural circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' repository ', ' Documentation ', ' complex R ', ' cis-(Rh(biq)2Cl2)Cl ', "" Rh (2,2'-biquinoline) complex "", ' histone modification ', ' computerized data processing ', ' data processing ', ' Institution ', ' Data ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Reproducibility ', ' genomic region ', ' Genomic Segment ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Process ', ' Docking ', ' Modification ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' meta data ', ' Metadata ', ' work group ', ' working group ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' data modeling ', ' data integration ', ' Data Coordination Center ', ' Data Coordinating Center ', ' next generation ', ' visualization tool ', ' Visualization software ', ' Bioconductor ', ' brain research ', ' database structure ', ' data base structure ', ' operation ', ' cloud based ', ' data visualization ', ' data archive ', ' brain abnormalities ', ' online resource ', ' web-based resource ', ' web resource ', ' on-line resource ', ' internet resource ', ' cloud storage ', ' cloud-based storage ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' data resource ', ' innovative neurotechnologies ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R24,2017,1247018,MD-07,-0.02155119663253706
"Transformative Computational Infrastructures for Cell-Based Biomarker Diagnostics Project Summary The presence of abnormal cell populations in patient samples is diagnostic for a variety of human diseases, especially leukemias and lymphomas. One of the main technologies used for cell-based diagnostic evaluation is flow cytometry, which employs fluorescent reagents to measure molecular characteristics of cell populations in complex mixtures. While cytometry evaluation is routinely used for the diagnosis of blood-borne malignancies, it could be more widely applied to the diagnosis of other diseases (e.g. asthma, allergy and autoimmunity) if it could be reproducibly used to interpret higher complexity staining panels and recognize more subtle cell population differences. Flow cytometry analysis is also widely used for single cell phenotyping in translational research studies to explore the mechanisms of normal and abnormal biological processes. More recently, the development of mass cytometry promises to further increase the application of single cell cytometry evaluation to understand a wide range of physiological, pathological and therapeutic processes. The current practice for cytometry data analysis relies on “manual gating” of two-dimensional data plots to identify cell subsets in complex mixtures. However, this process is subjective, labor intensive, and irreproducible making it difficult to deploy in multicenter translational research studies or clinical trials where protocol standardization and harmonization are essential. The goal of this project is to develop, validate and disseminate a user-friendly infrastructure for the computational analysis of cytometry data for both diagnostic and discovery applications that could help overcome the current limitations of manual analysis and provide for more efficient, objective and accurate analysis, through the following aims: Specific Aim 1 – Implement a novel computational infrastructure – FlowGate – for cytometry data analysis that includes visual analytics and machine learning; Specific Aim 2 – Assess the utility of FlowGate for cell population characterization in mechanistic translational research studies (T1); Specific Aim 3 – Assess the robustness and accuracy of FlowGate for clinical diagnostics in comparison with the current standard-of-care analysis of diagnostic cytometry data (T2); Specific Aim 4 – Develop training and educational resources and conduct directed outreach activities to stimulate adoption and use of the resulting FlowGate cyberinfrastructure. The project will have a major impact in advancing translational science by overcoming key hurdles for adoption of these computational methods by facilitating analysis pipeline optimization, providing intuitive user interfacing, and delivering directed training activities. The application of the developed computational infrastructure for improved diagnostics of AML and CLL will contribute to the new emphasis on precision medicine by more precisely quantifying the patient-specific characteristics of neoplastic and normal reactive cell populations. Although FlowGate will be developed by the UC San Diego, UC Irvine, and Stanford CTSAs, the resulting computational infrastructure will be made freely available to the entire research community. Project Narrative Flow cytometry analysis is widely used for single cell phenotyping in the translational research lab to explore the mechanisms of normal and abnormal biological processes and in the clinical diagnostic lab for the identification and classification of blood-borne malignancies. However, the current practice for cytometry data analysis using “manual gating” based on two-dimensional data plots is subjective, labor-intensive and unreliable, especially when using more complex high content staining panels.

"Health, Neighborhood Context, and Mobility Neighborhood context may be an upstream cause of economic mobility, yet few neighborhood studies are experimental, weakening causal inference and limiting policy translation. Our study proposes to analyze newly- available data from a large, federal government initiated social experiment of voluntary neighborhood relocation using housing vouchers in 5 US cities (the Moving to Opportunity, MTO, Study). Our project will test whether, how, and among whom random assignment of an offer to move to a lower-poverty neighborhood influenced the economic mobility of 4600 low-income families over a 15 year period. The goal of MTO was to interrupt the cascading effects of neighborhood poverty for minority low-income families, by increasing area- based access to opportunities, and thereby promote economic mobility. Although the MTO voucher intervention did not consistently affect economic outcomes, it did profoundly affect health. Unfortunately, health researchers have had limited access to MTO data, compromising the scientific payoff of the $70+ million investment. So as of yet, we have no clear understanding of why results might differ across outcomes, groups, or what mechanisms are at play, since few studies have tested mediation or moderation. Since health is one of the most important barriers to economic self-sufficiency among low-income parents, it is conceivable that economic and employment gains were concentrated among families who first experienced health improvements. However testing whether factors that occurred after random assignment are precursors for other outcomes is methodologically challenging. Fortunately, recent methodological developments in the epidemiology discipline offer cogent solutions to model this complexity and bound any bias. We propose secondary data analyses with newly available 15 year follow-up data from this experiment, to test whether health influenced the economic effects of the randomized MTO housing voucher treatment. Paired with this experimental design, we propose to apply innovative causal methods and machine learning techniques for assessing mediation and effect modification, to overcome limitations and potential bias of traditional approaches, and strengthen causal inference. Our R01 project builds on a productive, interdisciplinary team, experienced with the MTO data, and draws on a barriers-to-employment framework. We propose 4 aims to determine: whether the effect of MTO on economic outcomes was modified by baseline health vulnerability; whether MTO improved parental economic outcomes, if they or their children experienced health gains; whether MTO improved children’s employment and education, if they experienced health gains; whether MTO improved economic outcomes, if families moved to neighborhoods with fewer spatial barriers to employment. Our findings have direct policy relevance since they address a key policy question in housing voucher implementation: incorporating elements from non-housing sectors (e.g., health, employment, education) to promote moves to higher opportunity neighborhoods, to ultimately improve outcomes for low income families. This project will test whether health-related barriers to employment mediate and moderate the effects of a social experiment of housing and neighborhood relocation on economic mobility, among adolescents, young adults, and their mothers. This knowledge will inform the next generation of social policy, e.g., to provide guidance on augmenting housing counseling assistance services to include health-related additional program supports and cross-sectoral services (e.g. health management or substance use treatment services) for vulnerable families.","Health, Neighborhood Context, and Mobility",9382407,R01HD090014,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Budgets ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Child Development ', ' Cities ', ' Counseling ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Economics ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Elements ', ' Employment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Family ', ' National Government ', ' Federal Government ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Housing ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' indexing ', ' Investments ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mothers ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Parents ', ' Play ', ' Poverty ', ' Privatization ', ' Public Housing ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Wages ', ' Salaries ', ' Social Policies ', ' Social Welfare ', ' welfare ', ' Testing ', ' Translations ', ' Weight ', ' Measures ', ' Data Compromising ', ' Mediating ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Discipline ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' interdisciplinary collaboration ', ' transdisciplinary collaboration ', ' cohort ', ' Family health status ', ' Family Health ', ' Participant ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' voucher ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Low income ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Interruption ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Modification ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' next generation ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' treatment effect ', ' volunteer ', ' economic outcome ', ' treatment group ', ' improved outcome ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' lower income families ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2017,476644,MN-05,-0.016401010235932014
"Computational Modeling of Heterogeneous Gene Expression in Single Cells ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The recent development of single cell RNA-seq protocols enabled genomewide investigation of organismal systems at the cellular level, opening many new biological questions for study. Single cell resolution allows characterization of rare or unknown cell types, enables dissection of differentiation processes, and aids in decoding regulatory networks responsible for healthy and diseased states of cells. However, current single cell RNA-seq studies are limited by crucial gaps in existing computational methods.  We have devised strategies to address three key limitations of current single cell RNA-seq analysis methods: (1) lack of models for isoform-specific expression, (2) inability to link gene expression differences with measurable changes in cell function, and (3) lack of methods for studying sequential progression of gene expression changes. To address the first shortcoming, we developed SingleSplice, an algorithm for identifying genes whose isoform ratios vary more than expected by chance across a set of single cells (Aim 1). We have also developed a novel microraft platform that allows culturing, functional characterization, isolation, and subsequent sequencing of single cells. Using data generated from this platform, we will perform supervised machine learning to identify genes linked to functional differences among cells (Aim 2). To address the third limitation, we will use locally linear embedding, a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique, to identify ""trajectories"" of cells proceeding through sequential processes such as development and response to stimuli (Aim 3). We will apply our methods to our own data generated from microraft experiments, as well as publicly available single cell RNA-seq data from developing lung tissue and immune cells responding to immune stimulation.  Using data from experiments in which spike-in transcripts are added at constant, known amounts to cells to mimic an alternative splicing change, we found that SingleSplice detects isoform switching with high sensitivity (73%) and specificity (93%). We used microrafts to sequence single cells from a pancreatic cancer cell line and found that this approach produced high-quality data comparable to that from the Fluidigm C1. The microraft technology also enabled us to sequence RNA from pancreatic cancer cells after gemcitabine treatment and measure the proliferation of the cells, identifying both ""drug resistant"" cells that divide and cels that do not proliferate, giving a dataset with matched functional and transcriptomic measurements. Preliminary investigation of a dataset in which dendritic cells were stimulated with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) shows that locally linear embedding (LLE) can order cells according to the length of time they have been exposed to LPS.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Until very recently, studies have relied on aggregate measurements taken from bulk samples of cells, but in many important health-related applications, the information lost by lumping together thousands of cells poses a real barrier to understanding. Neurological conditions, cancer, and stem cell therapies are among the many areas that call for single cell RNA-seq methods. We propose to develop broadly applicable computational methods that will eliminate key limitations of current analyses and enable groundbreaking research in many domains important for public health.            ",Computational Modeling of Heterogeneous Gene Expression in Single Cells,9285609,F31HG008912,"['Algorithms ', ' Alternative RNA Splicing ', ' Alternate Splicing ', ' Alternative Splicing ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Motility ', ' Cellular Motility ', ' Cellular Migration ', ' Cell Movement ', ' Cell Migration ', ' Cell Locomotion ', ' cell motility ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell physiology ', ' cell sorting ', ' Cell Separation Technology ', ' Cell Segregation ', ' Cell Isolation ', ' Cell Separation ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Veiled Cells ', ' Dendritic Cells ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Dissection ', ' resistant to Drug ', ' resistance to Drug ', ' drug resistant ', ' Drug resistance ', ' drug treatment ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Exhibits ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Immunization ', ' Immunostimulation ', ' Immunological Stimulation ', ' Immunological Sensitization ', ' Immunologic Stimulation ', ' Immunologic Sensitization ', ' Lipopolysaccharides ', ' Lung ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mus ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Noise ', ' Pancreas ', ' Pancreatic ', ' Phenotype ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Specificity ', ' Supervision ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' dFdCyd ', ' dFdC ', ' Difluorodeoxycytidine ', ' gemcitabine ', ' Measures ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' Glean ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' RNA Sequences ', ' Area ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Link ', ' infantile ', ' infancy ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' Data Quality ', ' Measurement ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' Malignant neoplasm of pancreas ', ' Pancreatic Cancer ', ' Pancreas Cancer ', ' Malignant Pancreatic Neoplasm ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Investigation ', ' Dimensions ', ' Immune ', ' Immunes ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' cell type ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Cell Proliferation ', ' Cellular Proliferation ', ' Cell Multiplication ', ' Cell Growth in Number ', ' neoplastic cell ', ' Tumor Cell ', ' Protein Isoforms ', ' Isoforms ', ' single cell analysis ', ' novel ', ' Structure of parenchyma of lung ', ' Lung Tissue ', ' Lung Parenchyma ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' stem cell therapy ', ' stem cell therapeutics ', ' Alpha Cell ', ' α-cell ', ' Glucagon Secreting Cell ', ' Glucagon Cell ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Measurable ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' molecular signature ', ' molecular profile ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' Resolution ', ' Transcript ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' transcriptomics ', ' gene discovery ', ' discover genes ', ' public health relevance ', ' genome-wide ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' pancreatic cancer cells ', ' pancreatic tumor cells ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' single cell sequencing ', ' transcriptome ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' ']",NHGRI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,F31,2017,11757,NC-04,-0.006031012889925936
"Integration and Visualization of Diverse Biological Data ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The onset of most human disease involves multiple, molecular-level changes to the complex system of interacting genes and pathways that function differently in specific cell-lineage, pathway and treatment contexts. While this system has been probed by the thousands of functional genomics and quantitative genetic studies, careful extraction of signals relevant to these specific contexts is a challenging problem. General integration of these heterogeneous data was an important first step in detecting signals that be used to build networks to generate experimentally-testable hypotheses. However, only by dealing with the fact that disease happens at the intersection of multiple contexts and by integrating functional genomics with quantitative genetics will we be able to move toward a molecular-level understanding of human pathophysiology, which will pave the way to new therapy and drug development.  The long-term goal of this project is to enable such discoveries through the development of innovative bioinformatics frameworks for integrative analysis of diverse functional genomic data. In the previous funding periods, we developed accurate data integration and visualization methodologies for most common model organisms and human, created methods for tissue-specific data analysis, and applied these methods to make novel insights about important biological processes. We further enabled experimental biological discovery by implementing these methods in publicly accessible interactive systems that are popular with experimental biologists.  Leveraging our prior work, we now will directly address the challenge of enabling data-driven study of molecular mechanisms underlying human disease by developing novel semi-supervised and multi-task machine learning approaches and implementing them in a real-time integration system capable of predicting genome-scale functional and mechanism-specific networks focused on any biological context of interest. This will allow any biomedical researcher to quickly make data-driven hypotheses about function, interactions, and regulation of genes involved in hypertension in the kidney glomerulus or to predict new regulatory interactions relevant to Parkinson's disease that affect the ubiquitination pathway in Substantia nigra. Furthermore, we will develop methods for disease gene discovery that leverage these highly specific networks for functional analysis of quantitative genetics data. Our deliverable will be a general, robust, user-friendly, and automatically updated system for user-driven functional genomic data integration and functional analysis of quantitative genetics data. Throughout this work, we (with our close experimental and clinical collaborators) will also apply our methods to chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease/hypertension, and autism spectrum disorders both as case studies for the iterative improvement of our methods and to make direct contribution to better understanding of these diseases.

"HERCULES: Exposome Research Center PROJECT SUMMARY: HERCULES The vision of the HERCULES P30 is to demonstrably advance the role of environmental health sciences in clinical and public health settings using the platform of the exposome. Healthcare and biomedical research have become increasingly genome-centric. While much of this is due to the impressive achievements in genomics, which have consistently outpaced gains in environmental health, it is our contention that a more persuasive case needs to be made for environmental factors. Science and intuition support the idea that the environment plays just as large of a role as genetics for the majority of diseases. The exposome, which embraces a strategy and scale similar to genomic research, is poised to elevate the environment in discussions of health and disease. We will continue to grow and enhance the environmental health science research portfolio at Emory through cutting-edge technologies and innovative data solutions. We will build upon the superb relationships we have built with the local community and continue to push the mission of NIEHS on campus and across the scientific landscape. Based on the extraordinary progress over our first three years, we propose to retain our theme to use exposome-related concepts and approaches to improve human health. This simple and unifying vision will continue to stimulate discovery, promote collaboration, and enhance communication through the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. To marshal physical and intellectual resources to support exposome-related approaches (high-resolution metabolomics, analytical chemistry, systems biology, machine learning, bioinformatics, high-throughput toxicology, and spatial and temporal statistical models) through cores, pilot funding, mentoring, and research forums. Specific Aim 2. To make major contributions towards exposome and environmental health science research. Specific Aim 3. To provide career development activities around innovative and emerging concepts and approaches related to the exposome. Specific Aim 4. To enhance and expand existing relationships with community partners to resolve environmental health issues in the community using exposome principles. Specific Aim 5. To provide infrastructure and resources to facilitate rapid translation of novel scientific findings into the development of prevention and treatment strategies in humans. Pursuit of HERCULES' aims will advance environmental health sciences within our institutions and in the scientific community. PROJECT NARRATIVE: HERCULES Human health and disease is dictated by a combination of genetic and environmental factors.

"Niche signals in HSC genesis PROJECT SUMMARY Hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) have well established clinical applications in the treatment of heritable and acquired blood disorders. However, their therapeutic potential could be significantly broadened by engineering novel methods to generate HSC de novo from pluripotent stem cells or from directly reprogrammed adult cells. Toward this goal, we have established endothelial cell (EC) niche based culture methods that provide the necessary conditions to support the specification and self-renewal of HSC from embryonic hemogenic precursors, and more recently, from adult ECs using transcription factor (TF)-mediated conversion that bypasses a pluripotent intermediate. We hypothesize that recreating the signals necessary and sufficient to develop a clinically meaningful system for HSC generation in vitro will necessitate a comprehensive, systems approach to deconstruct the niche provided signals required for HSC specification and self-renewal. Thus, the overall goal of this grant is to leverage unique expertise of the collaborating laboratories to elucidate the signaling interactions regulating HSC specification and self-renewal from embryonic hemogenic precursors or TF-reprogrammed adult EC in the context of the EC niche. Our approach consists of three overlapping aims. The first aim will identify EC niche-provided signals necessary for embryonic HSC specification and self-renewal. The second aim will identify the unique HSC programs induced by these signals that regulate the transition from embryonic hemogenic precursor to bone fide repopulating HSC. The third will identify comparable programs that regulate the transition from adult EC to HSC during TF-mediated reprogramming in the EC niche. Key to these studies will be innovative functional assays, transcriptional profiling methods, and computational approaches that will enable us to resolve cellular complexity of niche cells and their interactions with developing embryonic or reprogrammed HSC at the single cell level. The role of identified signal factors in stage-specific support of HSC specification will be validated and further refined in vitro by gain and loss of function studies in the context of niche EC. Furthermore, to extend these studies to stromal cell-free systems as a step toward clinical translation, we will also test the contribution of identified signal factors in HSC specification and self-renewal in the context of stage-specific modulation of Notch activation using engineered Notch agonists. To achieve the goals of this proposal, we have developed a multidisciplinary collaboration involving unique expertise in each of our laboratories, including basic HSC and EC niche cell biology, direct TF based cellular conversion, clinical HSC transplantation, genome wide assessment of rare stem cell populations at single cell resolution, and innovative computational approaches to deconstruct core signal pathways regulating developmental transitions. Altogether, we expect the proposed studies will ultimately guide the design of novel strategies for deriving and expanding HSC in vitro for therapeutic applications. NARRATIVE Hematopoietic stem cells are currently used in the treatment and cure of a variety of blood disorders. Methods to generate new or greater numbers of hematopoietic stem cells in the laboratory could expand the availability and therapeutic applications of these valuable cells, but currently such methods are lacking. The goal of this proposal is to use lessons from endothelial cells, which provide critical signals to support hematopoietic stem cells, to engineer novel systems for the development and expansion of hematopoietic stem cells in culture. !",Niche signals in HSC genesis,9380263,RC2DK114777,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Algorithms ', ' Aorta ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Embryonic Cell ', ' Blastocytes ', ' blastomere structure ', ' vascular ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' bone ', ' cell culture ', ' Cell Culture Techniques ', ' Cellfree System ', ' Cell-Free System ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Embryonic ', ' Embryo ', ' Embryogenesis ', ' Embryo Development ', ' Embryonic Development ', ' Engineering ', ' Goals ', ' gonads ', ' gonad ', ' Gonadal structure ', ' Grant ', ' blood disorder ', ' Hematological Disorder ', ' Hematologic Diseases ', ' Blood Diseases ', ' Hematological Disease ', ' hematopoietic stem progenitor cell ', ' hematopoietic progenitor ', ' Hematopoietic Progenitor Cells ', ' Blood Precursor Cell ', ' Hematopoietic stem cells ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' In Vitro ', ' indexing ', ' Laboratories ', ' Mesonephric structure ', ' Wolffian Body ', ' Mesonephros ', ' Methods ', ' Physiological Processes ', ' Physiologic Processes ', ' Organismal Process ', ' Organism-Level Process ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Testing ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' transcription factor ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' Generations ', ' notch receptors ', ' notch ', ' notch protein ', ' Mediating ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Stromal Cells ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Endothelial Cells ', ' insight ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant ', ' HSC transplantation ', ' Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation ', ' Agonist ', ' Coculture ', ' Cocultivation ', ' Co-culture ', ' Coculture Techniques ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Cellular biology ', ' cell biology ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' embryonic stem cell ', ' stem cell of embryonic origin ', ' ES cell ', ' receptor ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' novel ', ' Sorting - Cell Movement ', ' sorting ', ' Bypass ', ' Pluripotent Stem Cells ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Address ', ' Molecular Analysis ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Signaling Molecule ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Heritability ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' loss of function ', ' self-renewal ', ' self-renew ', ' stem ', ' genome-wide ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' stem cell population ', ' Systems Development ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' clinical translation ', ' ']",NIDDK,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,RC2,2017,683358,WA-07,-0.003953525454029172
"Measuring, Modeling and Controlling Heterogeneity ABSTRACT - Overall The overall goal of the Measuring, Modeling and Controlling Heterogeneity Center in the Cancer Systems Biol- ogy Consortium (M2CH-CSBC Center) is to improve management of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) by developing systems level strategies to prevent the emergence of cancer subpopulations that are resistant to treatment. We postulate that heterogeneity arising from epigenomic instability intrinsic to cancer cells and di- verse signals from extrinsic microenvironments in which cancer cells reside are root causes of resistance. We will learn how intrinsic and extrinsic factors influence differentiation state, proliferation and therapeutic re- sponse in TNBC through experimental manipulation and computational modeling of cancer cell lines, 3D engi- neered multicellular systems, xenografts and clinical specimens. We will deploy single cell `omic and imaging technologies that allow quantitative assessment of molecular, cellular, and structural heterogeneity. We will interpret these data using computational models that define control networks and structures in heterogeneous systems as well as transitions between states of therapeutic resistance and sensitivity. This will be accom- plished in three related Projects and three Cores. Project 1 will focus on measuring and managing resistance- associated heterogeneity intrinsic to cancer cells. Project 2 will focus on identifying resistance-associated sig- nals from the microenvironment and on mitigating effects from these signals on therapeutic response. Project 3 will apply spatial systems biology approaches to TNBC specimens and multicell type models thereof to dis- cover molecular control networks that influence how cell intrinsic plasticity and microenvironment signaling al- ter therapeutic responses in complex tissues. All three Projects will include analysis of 5 core cell lines (HCC1143, HCC1599, MDA-MB-468, SUM149PT, and HCC1806), 5 patient derived cultures, and 6 FDA ap- proved, pathway-targeted drugs (afatinib, ruxolotinib, trametinib, BYL719, cabozantinib, and everolimus). The computational network discovery, data integration, spatial systems analysis and modeling approaches are the same in all Projects and serve to integrate the work of the overall M2CH-CSBC Center. Multiple integrative computational strategies are proposed to identify candidate heterogeneity control networks. These include analysis of existing genomic, epigenomic, pharmacologic response, and metabolomic characteristics of prima- ry tumors and models thereof. An Imaging Management and Analysis Core will provide infrastructure and image analytics that will enable efficient image data management, quantitative analysis of image features, and visualization of images and metadata generated using multiscale light and electron microscopy. An Outreach Core will make educational materials, experimental and computational tools and data available to the CSB Consortium, to the CSBC/PS-ON Coordinating Center and to the broader scientific community. An Administrative Core serves as the organization, integration, and evaluation hub of the M2CH-CSBC Center. Project narrative This Project will improve management of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) by understanding and managing heterogeneity arising from epigenomic instability intrinsic to cancer cells and from diverse signals from extrinsic microenvironments in which cancer cells reside.","Measuring, Modeling and Controlling Heterogeneity",9350715,U54CA209988,"['neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Communities ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' In Vitro ', ' Leadership ', ' Learning ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Methods ', ' Electron Microscopy ', ' Patients ', ' Periodicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Proteins ', ' Reagent ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Stress ', ' Systems Analysis ', ' Systems Analyses ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Work ', ' Immunofluorescence ', ' Immunofluorescence Immunologic ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Custom ', ' Visualization ', ' Imagery ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Measurement ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Therapeutic ', ' cancer cell ', ' Malignant Cell ', ' Specimen ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' light microscopy ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Xenograft procedure ', ' xeno-transplantation ', ' xeno-transplant ', ' Xenotransplantation ', ' Xenograft ', ' Heterologous Transplantation ', ' Heterograft ', ' SDZ RAD ', ' everolimus ', ' data management ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' outreach ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' bioimaging ', ' biomedical imaging ', ' bio-imaging ', ' Genomics ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' metabolomics ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' Microarray Analysis ', ' microarray technology ', ' microarray analyses ', ' Microarray-Based Analysis ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Data ', ' Educational Materials ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' in vivo ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Clonal Expansion ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' meta data ', ' Metadata ', ' triple-negative breast cancer ', ' TNBC ', ' triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma ', ' treatment resistance ', ' therapeutic resistance ', ' resistant to therapy ', ' resistance to therapy ', ' therapy resistant ', ' epigenomics ', ' image visualization ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' data integration ', ' Imaging technology ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' analytical tool ', ' combinatorial ', ' Cell model ', ' Cellular model ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' open source ', ' network models ', ' tumor ', ' FDA approved ', ' treatment response ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted therapy ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' quantitative imaging ', ' MDA-MB-468 ', ' bioprinting ', ' bio-printing ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' ']",NCI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,U54,2017,1876979,OR-03,-0.06564321278827515

In our new CTSA hub, we will build on our current CTSA's successes over the past 5½ years, with unique innovative integration of exceptional training approaches, including: 1) mentored career development within CTSA-supported multidisciplinary translational teams (MTTs); 2) an emphasis on individual development plans (IDPs) and pre-established C&T research competencies tailored to the needs of the individual scholar, but also emphasizing team-based competencies; 3) development of leadership competencies through participation in a new Leadership Development Academy; 4) an Academy of Research Mentors (ARM), based within our Institute for Translational Sciences (ITS), to foster mentoring and mentor training; 5) a linked Translational Research Scholars Program (TRSP), which provides an expanded peer group and a wider impact across the institution, with twice-monthly career development seminars and a focus on scholars' research; 6) development of entrepreneurial skills and leadership through participation in a UT System-funded Healthcare Entrepreneurship Program; and 7) collaboration and dissemination of program experience to other CTSA hubs in the Texas Regional CTSA Consortium, and the national CTSA Consortium. An important feature of our KL2 Scholars Program is its linked position within the continuum of career development, from graduate student training in our CTSA TL1 Training Core to the production of independently funded C&T faculty members. Our program is enhanced with by financial support from our Provost's office for scholar expenses, ITS education administrators, the ARM, and the Office of Faculty Affairs, which is focused on faculty development at UTMB. UTMB also ranks nationally in promoting diversity, which will enhance our recruitment of underrepresented minority scholars by the participation of faculty from our Hispanic Center of Excellence, and our Medical School Enrichment Program. Our KL2 Program is well-integrated with other institutional education activities, including our Human Pathophysiology and Translational Medicine graduate program, and courses targeted toward scientific writing, biostatistics, and study design. Early-career faculty as Phase 1 TRSP scholars can compete to become CTSA-supported KL2 Scholars, and with acquisition of their first mentored K-level grants (e.g., K08), advance to a Phase 2 TRSP Scholar, then focusing on the transition from mentored to independent grant funding. Upon acquisition of independent (e.g. R01) funding, scholars advance to become Phase 3 TRSP Scholars and Associate Members in the ARM, to facilitate their development of mentoring skills, and eventually to full ARM membership, with demonstrated success in C&T science mentoring. Our KL2 Scholars Program thus integrates novel team-based training, leadership, and mentoring approaches to foster the career development of future leaders in C&T research.

"OMOP information model for eMERGE phenotyping ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medical care informed by genomic information is beginning to move into clinical practice. The Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network through its initial phases has provided much of the groundwork for this transformation. The Geisinger Health System project, ""EMR-Linked Biobank for Translational Genomics"" intends to build on the knowledge and experience from eMERGE phase II to accelerate discovery and implementation while expanding our understanding of the sociocultural implications of genomics in medicine. We will accomplish this goal through three specific aims: 1) Use existing biospecimens, genotype and sequence data and EMR-generated phenotypes for discovery in the proposed disorders: familial hypercholesterolemia and chronic rhinosinusitis, 2) Develop and test approaches for implementation of genomic information in clinical practice, 3) Explore, develop and implement novel approaches for family-centered communication around clinically relevant genomic results. We currently have over 60,000 patients broadly consented for research with a large and increasing proportion consented for return of results and deposition in the electronic health record. Over 18,000 patients are genotyped on high density platforms. Our two proposed phenotypes, familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) were chosen because both conditions have a significant public health impact in the United States, but they are also ideally suited to the specific aims of the project. They provide opportunities for innovation and extension of current eMERGE methods. While many of these innovations will take advantage of the sequencing done as part of the project, there are several other areas emphasized in the funding opportunity that will broaden the scope of eMERGE research. One of the areas of emphasis for eMERGE III is exploring the familial return of actionable results. FH is well suited to this, as the current clinical recommendation is cascade testing of family members for all diagnosed patients. Currently this relies on the patient to contact at risk family members, but this is less than optimal. We will explore this issue using qualitative and quantitative methods and use the results to design and test novel family communication strategies. Gene-environment interactions play an important role in the development and severity of disease. These are very difficult to study. We propose novel approaches that leverage the assets of Geisinger Health System and the eMERGE Network to develop and apply methods to extend existing projects that study the impact of environment on CRS. This would include the first large scale environment-wide association studies (EWAS). Finally, we propose to lead efforts to apply the tools of economic modeling and analysis to eMERGE projects to begin to quantify the value of implementation of genomic medicine in the US healthcare system.

"Using clinical data to identify FDA-approved drugs for cancer prevention and therapeutic repurposing Project Summary/Abstract Clinical data collection is accelerating rapidly, and in the future it will include both provider- and patient- generated data. Hidden within this mass of noisy observational data are clues as to factors influencing disease onset and outcome. Finding ways to exploit this trove of disease data can unlock a new perspective on disease processes. We can tackle disease both from the bottom-up, from experimental data generated in the laboratory, and from the top down, from clinical phenomena observed across human populations. A particularly impactful and prevalent disease is cancer. Each tumor harbors a unique combination of mutations driving a distinct set of oncogenic processes. Targeted therapies have been proposed to pinpoint these mutations, potentially requiring a vast array of therapeutic options. Cancer treatment often fails when drug resistance arises, another result of the complex combinatorial nature of tumor alterations. Combination therapies have been proposed as an approach to interfere with multiple disease signals simultaneously. However, identifying effective drug combinations, and the cancer types in which they are effective, is experimentally infeasible, leading to a push for computational solutions. In this proposal, we combine methods from social sciences and biostatistics to find the causal effect of a drug on cancer onset from observational clinical data. Both increased and decreased cancer rates in drug-takers are of equal interest, as they can inform us of disease processes and provide clinical impact. We are particularly interested in finding drug combinations that impact cancer. These combination effects are unlikely to have been detected, and our clinical data provides a unique resource for observing the effects of tens of thousands of drug combinations. We will pool the resulting causal drug effect estimates across the many cancers present in our data. To gain insight into the cellular processes underlying clinical effect, we will examine the impact of known cancer-causing drugs in vitro, using large public cell line assays. The accompanying goal is to provide Dr. Rachel Melamed with a career development experience to become an independent scientist. Her research will use observational health data to understand the genesis of cancer, prevent the disease, and discover new therapeutic options. This proposal takes advantage of the interdisciplinary strengths of the University of Chicago in computation, biostatistics, and medicine, as well as institutional resources in terms of data access and infrastructure. Dr. Melamed has assembled a team consisting of complementary mentors and collaborators with expertise in computation, statistics, translational medicine, personalized therapy, and cancer therapy. The career development plan focuses on enhancing her statistics and machine learning skills with structured coursework and mentorship, and gaining experience in biomedical applications via applied work and mentorship. This will provide Dr. Melamed with skills to model observational data and to integrate the results with experimental data. Project Narrative Clinical data has been shown to hold patterns relating drugs to cancer onset. Using this data to find drugs that increase cancer rates will provide insight into the disease and an opportunity for preventing some cancer cases. Discovery of drugs, and particularly drug combinations, that reduce cancer rates could suggest low-cost new therapeutic options.",Using clinical data to identify FDA-approved drugs for cancer

"Reactome: An Open Knowledgebase of Human Pathways Project Summary  We seek renewal of the core operating funding for the Reactome Knowledgebase of Human Biological Pathways and Processes. Reactome is a curated, open access biomolecular pathway database that can be freely used and redistributed by all members of the biological research community. It is used by clinicians, geneti- cists, genomics researchers, and molecular biologists to interpret the results of high-throughput experimental studies, by bioinformaticians seeking to develop novel algorithms for mining knowledge from genomic studies, and by systems biologists building predictive models of normal and disease variant pathways.  Our curators, PhD-level scientists with backgrounds in cell and molecular biology work closely with in- dependent investigators within the community to assemble machine-readable descriptions of human biological pathways. Each pathway is extensively checked and peer-reviewed prior to publication to ensure its assertions are backed up by the primary literature, and that human molecular events inferred from orthologous ones in animal models have an auditable inference chain. Curated Reactome pathways currently cover 8930 protein- coding genes (44% of the translated portion of the genome) and ~150 RNA genes. We also offer a network of reliable ‘functional interactions’ (FIs) predicted by a conservative machine-learning approach, which covers an additional 3300 genes, for a combined coverage of roughly 60% of the known genome.  Over the next five years, we will: (1) curate new macromolecular entities, clinically significant protein sequence variants and isoforms, and drug-like molecules, and the complexes these entities form, into new reac- tions; (2) supplement normal pathways with alternative pathways targeted to significant diseases and devel- opmental biology; (3) expand and automate our tools for curation, management and community annotation; (4) integrate pathway modeling technologies using probabilistic graphical models and Boolean networks for pathway and network perturbation studies; (5) develop additional compelling software interfaces directed at both computational and lab biologist users; and (6) and improve outreach to bioinformaticians, molecular bi- ologists and clinical researchers. Project Narrative  Reactome represents one of a very small number of open access curated biological pathway databases. Its authoritative and detailed content has directly and indirectly supported basic and translational research studies with over-representation analysis and network-building tools to discover patterns in high-throughput data.

"Pharmaco Response Signatures and Disease Mechanism DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the HMS LINCS Center is to delineate the fundamental principles of cellular response to perturbagens at the level of single-cells and cell populations and to make response data routinely available via web-based browse, query and programmatic interfaces. This will involve the development and testing of new measurement methods, computational algorithms, and response signatures for diverse human cell types exposed to perturbations individually and in combination. We will emphasize the systematic collection of data not currently available in existing public databases including live and fixed-cell imaging, biochemical data on signaling proteins and multi-factorial drug-response phenotypes. A focus on diverse transformed and primary cells, including those derived from healthy and diseased donors, and on clinical grade small molecules (kinase inhibitors and epigenome drugs) will increase the translational impact of our work. The proposed LINCS Center represents a continuation of a program in operation for ~3.5 years under a LINCS pilot phase U54 award. We will expand the scope and sophistication of our Center, devoting  significant effort to (i) improving the quality of data analysis and visualization, particularly wih respect to the  complexities of perturbagen polypharmacy (ii) accelerating the release of perturbagen-response signatures  using methods that have been demonstrated to yield reliable and informative data, with a particular  emphasis on primary and non-transformed cells (iii) developing and applying new measurement methods,  particularly mass spectrometry for analysis of cell populations and live-cell imaging for analysis of single cells.  The work will involve nine complementary but independent aims. In Data Generation, Aim 1 will perform systematic analysis of perturbagen responses at a single-cell level. Aim 2 will collect multiplex protein and mRNA data on perturbagen response using a set of complementary imaging, mass spectrometry and bead-based assays. Aim 3 will apply LINCS methods to non-transformed immune cells and induced pluripotent stem cells, and explore if signatures can guide a detailed medicinal chemistry campaign. In Data Analysis, Aim 4 will construct perturbagen-response signatures using statistical modeling, network inference and machine learning methods. Aim 5 will develop new approaches to understanding and analyzing drug interactions on multiple phenotypes in single cells. Aim 6 will develop a novel compressed sensing framework for analyzing the poly-pharmacology of kinase inhibitors. Aim 7 will enhance the query, browse and explore functions of the HMS LINCS website and database and its integration with the UCSC Genome Browser. In Community Interaction and Outreach, Aim 8 will implement diverse training and outreach activities, including collaboration with LINCS and non-LINCS research groups. In Administration, Aim 9 will ensure effective management of the Center, sustained access to tools and data produced within the LINCS Project, and compliance with program goals. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Disease networks are complex interactions between multiple proteins. Precise understanding of the multifactorial perturbations imposed on multi-component networks is a crucial step in the development of a rational approach to drug discovery and personalization of therapy. The LINCS Center we propose will develop innovative computational and experimental methods for understanding cellular perturbagen-response networks and will make the resulting data and new knowledge

"Omics data integration and analysis for structure-based multi-target drug design Abstract Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS), whole genome sequencing, and high-throughput techniques have generated vast amounts of diverse omics and phenotypic data. However, these sets of data have not yet been fully explored to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of drug discovery, which continues along the one- drug-one-gene paradigm. Consequently, the cost of bringing a drug to market is staggering, and the failure rate is daunting. Our long-term goal is to revive the lagging pharmaceutical pipeline by identifying robust methods for achieving precision medicine. We will achieve this goal by developing a novel structural systems pharmacology approach to drug discovery, which integrates structure-based drug design with heterogeneous omics data integration and analysis in the context of the whole human and pathogen genome and interactome. An increasing body of evidence from both our group and others suggests that most drugs commonly interact with multiple receptors (targets). Both strong and weak multiple drug-target interactions can collectively mediate drug efficacy, toxicity, and resistance through the conformational dynamics of biomolecules. In order to rationally design potent, safe, and precision medicine, we face one of the major unsolved challenges in structure-based drug design: what are all the possible proteins and their conformational states interacting with a drug in an organism? This proposal attempts to address this challenge by developing, disseminating, and experimentally testing novel computational tools. Based on our successful preliminary results, we will develop an integrated computational pipeline to identify three-dimensional (3D) protein-chemical interaction models in the cellular context and on a structural proteome scale. Specifically, we will develop a quaternary structure- centric multi-layered network model by integrating heterogeneous data from genomics, proteomics, and phenomics. We will develop a novel collaborative one-class collaborative filtering algorithm to infer missing relations in the multi-layered network. We will combine tools derived from structural bioinformatics, biophysics, and machine learning to gain biological insights into the drug action. To facilitate the usability and reproducibility of the proposed algorithms, we will develop community-based web resources established by our previous experiences in developing the Protein Data Bank (PDB). More importantly, we will work closely with experimental laboratories to test the proposed computational tools using targeted kinase polypharmacology as a real-world example, and iteratively improve the performance and usability of algorithm, software, and web services. The successful completion of this project will provide the scientific community with: (1) new methods to enhance the scope and capability of high-throughput screening for structure-based multi-target drug design; (2) a user-friendly web service to support community-based drug discovery; and (3) potential novel anti-cancer targeted therapeutics. Together, these tools will advance drug discovery and precision medicine by providing a structural systems pharmacology toolkit. Relevance Statement The pharmaceutical industry is in a dire state. Both the cost to launch a new drug and the attrition rate are increasing. Methods that can correlate drug-target interactions with clinical outcomes will reduce both the cost of drug development and mortality rates during clinical trials and treatments.",Omics data

"Integrative Biology Approach to Identify and Characterize Roles of lncRNAs Associated with Psoriasis Pathology PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Candidate After the completion of my Ph.D. in Bioinformatics, I joined the Center for Statistical Genetics at the University of Michigan (U-M) as research fellow and acquired extensive training in analysis on high- dimensional biological data. I uncovered a strong interest in studying the genetics and genomics of psoriasis when working with Dr. James Elder at the U-M, and I developed a fascination in understanding the functional roles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in cutaneous diseases. I joined the Department of Dermatology at the U-M as a faculty in summer of 2015, with secondary appointments in the Department of Computational Medicine & Bioinformatics and the Department of Biostatistics. In addition, I direct the new Center for Cutaneous Bioinformatics within the Department of Dermatology, and serve to supervise and implement an analysis pipeline for studies investigating the immunological mechanisms for different skin diseases. Career Development Plan I aim to become a future leader in combining in silico discovery and bench experiments to advance biomedical research in autoimmune skin disorders. My objective in seeking a Mentored Research Scientist Development Award is to acquire the additional knowledge, training, and experience necessary for me to become an independent scholar in developing novel systems biology approaches to decipher the pathology and mechanisms of cutaneous diseases. The five year training proposed will provide knowledge and experience in aspects that are critical to my success, and they are: i) To develop knowledge and experimental skills in cutaneous biology --- achieved by guidance from Dr. Elder (investigative dermatology), intense research meetings/conferences, and practical laboratory experience in cutaneous research; ii) To develop knowledge and skills to study immunological systems of autoimmune skin diseases --- achieved by supervision from Dr. Johann Gudjonsson (skin immunology), attending formal Immunology courses and seminars, and earning laboratory experience from immunology experiments; iii) To advance skills in developing statistical and computational approaches --- accomplished by mentoring from Dr. Goncalo Abecasis (computational biologist), research meetings, and conducting research projects requiring advanced skills and knowledge in quantitative science; iv) To cultivate my professional development through enhancing scientific connections, grantsmanship skills, and educator portfolio --- achieved by establishing connections with colleagues during meetings, visiting King’s College London as scholar, attending a grantsmanship workshop and bootcamp, and learning mentoring skills through teaching formal classes and mentoring research students. Through the intensive and comprehensive training, I will be well grounded in conducting basic science experiments and also be able to capitalize my advanced knowledge in quantitative science to model mechanisms in cutaneous diseases. Research Project The research project will use psoriasis as a disease model to study the roles of lncRNAs in complex cutaneous disorders. I will test the hypotheses that (i): some lncRNAs are key causal elements and potentiate pathogenic inflammatory reactions in psoriasis development and (ii) by combining in silico predictions and in vitro validations we are able to provide comprehensive characterization of skin-expressing lncRNAs in keratinocytes and lymphocytes to infer their pathological implications for psoriasis. This work will demonstrate how we can take advantages of the genomic data to develop an integrative biology framework to provide novel biological insights and understand pathological roles of lncRNAs. Significance Psoriasis is a chronic immune-mediated skin disease with complex genetic architecture. It is estimated that over 4 million Americans and 100 million people worldwide suffer from this disease. While genetic association studies have revealed the disease loci are highly enriched in non-coding regions, it is very challenging to translate genetic signals to biologic effects. In fact, most of the causal genes have not yet been identified. Our preliminary results showed that lncRNA is a class of gene that has largely been understudied for their roles in psoriasis, and both genetic and transcriptomic data suggested they can play important functions in psoriasis pathogenesis. By combining in silico analysis and in vitro validation we can expand our knowledge of lncRNAs in skin biology, and generate important hypotheses for future experiments. The results of this project can also identify novel biomarkers, and ultimately assist in the therapeutic drug discovery.

"Psoriasis Center of Research Translation The Psoriasis Center of Research Translation at Case Western Reserve University (CORT) will advance translational discovery and application in psoriasis using a cutting-edge systems biology approach that integrates patient-centered data within a rich and synergistic /collaborative institutional environment. We will leverage extensive preclinical, clinical and translational resources with the expertise and experience of our CWRU interdisciplinary research team, which encompasses bioinformatics, micro/myocobiome, psoriasis patient care, cutaneous immunology and transgenic models.  The overall goal of the CORT is to combine new bioinformatic methodologies with advanced murine and human experimental approaches to translate scientific findings into clinical applications that more nimbly advance therapy for psoriasis and related inflammatory comorbidities. Our highly innovative, synergistic and cross-disciplinary CORT model will use a collaborative research project (CRP) as a central hub with bi- directional input from 2 highly interactive research cores, to refine and test hypotheses, identify and test drug leads and advance understanding of psoriasis and related inflammatory comorbidities. To do so, the CRP will integrate input from the: 1) Preclinical Modeling Core (PMC), that will provide and customize our many validated, unique transgenic psoriasiform animal models and translatable human xenograft approaches, essential to translating new mediator/pathway roles and drug leads; 2) Applied Meta-`Omics Core (AMC), that will apply multi-platform (transcriptome, metabolome, micro/mycobiome) bioinformatics to individual patient and murine samples to identify novel pathway-specific targets. Iterative experimental testing of these targets and feedback from the PMC and CRP will identify key novel pathways critical for psoriasis pathogenesis likely to benefit from intervention by new drugs or repurposed existing drugs for psoriasis therapy.  Our patient-centered translational approach will exploit and enhance a novel, comprehensive and highly annotated database of ~850 psoriasis/psoriatic arthritis single-patient case records that combines clinical information derived from CLEARPATH (an Ohio medical provider consortium-based unified EMR repository for research access), with inflammation markers that stratify subsets. Into each patient's EMR, we will directly integrate his/her meta'Omics data created by the AMC working with the CRP, to create an 'Omics-integrated EMR (EMRi) data set. These cohesive multi-platform personal data records will identify psoriasis patient endotypes based upon unique perturbations identified from their “meta'Omics” analyses. Our overarching hypothesis is that by powerfully combining existing and developing psoriasis basic science datasets, patient records, bioinformatics and computational systems biology with bi-directional mouse and human studies, we will identify new therapeutic targets and repurposed drugs that can be expeditiously moved to clinical trials, improving psoriasis treatment and patient care. The Psoriasis CORT at Case Western Reserve University and University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center uses emerging capabilities of data analyses that can assemble many aspects of a single psoriasis patient in great detail, including their gene expression in skin and blood cells, the skin microbes (both bacterial and fungal) and the clinical features that are recorded in their electronic medical record (EMR). Using advanced computer algorithms to compare in-house patient data against externally available large databases, we can identify drugs already approved by the FDA that may be repurposed to treat psoriasis, and validate/invalidate them in animal models and patient cells.",Psoriasis Center of Research Translation,9370683,P50AR070590,"['Psoriasis Arthropathica ', ' Arthritic Psoriasis ', '

"Overall NIDA Core ""Center of Excellence"" in Transcriptomics, Systems Genetics and the Addictome Addiction is a highly complex disease with risk factors that include genetic variants and differences in development, sex, and environment. The long term potential of precision medicine to improve drug treatment and prevention depends on gaining a much better understanding how genetics, drugs, brain cells, and neuronal circuitry interact to influence behavior. There are serious technical barriers that prevent researchers and clinicians from incorporating more powerful computational and predictive methods in addiction research. The purpose of the NIDA P30 Core Center of Excellence in Omics, Systems Genetics, and the Addictome is to empower and train researchers supported by NIH, NIDA, NIAAA, and other federal and state institutions to use more quantitative and testable ways to analyze genetic, epigenetic, and the environmental factors that influence drug abuse risk and treatment. In the Transcriptome Informatics and Mechanisms research core we assemble and upgrade hundreds of large genome (DNA) and transcriptome (RNA) datasets for experimental rodent (rat) models of addiction. In the Systems Analytics and Modeling research core, we are using innovative systems genetics methods (gene mapping) to understand the linkage between DNA differences, environmental risks such as stress, and the differential risk of drug abuse and relapse. Our Pilot core is catalyzing new collaborations among young investigator in the field of addiction research. In sum the Center is a national resource for more reproducible research in addiction. We are centralizing, archiving, distributing, analyzing and integrating high quality data, metadata, using open software systems in collaboration with many other teams of researchers.

"BIGDATA: Mid-Scale DCM: DA: ESCE: Discovering Molecular Processes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer is a disease of the genome, caused by disruptions in a person's DNA. Orders of magnitude decreases in price and increases in sequencing throughput enabled sequencing of hundreds of genomes. This will launch a new phase bf ""Precision Medicine,"" where molecular markers can guide therapies tailored to patients. The genomics revolution is now systematically characterizing every somatic change in every tumor for large cohorts (>300 patients). Despite some successes, predicting cancer outcomes based on molecular signatures remains a major challenge. This proposal aims at obliterating several key roadblocks stymieing progress. First, the raw sequence data is not particularly well-suited for use in developing predictive models. Therefore, gene- and pathway-level evidence will be derived from CGHub to significantly increase the utility of the information for biomedical discovery. The information will be collected in a Social Graph technology framework like Facebook to scale to billions of interconnected objects called the Biomedical Evidence Graph (BMEG). Second, the datasets are so large they are impractical to move around on the internet. Thus, an environment will be created within which researchers can move their code to the vast amounts of data within the BMEG. Third, prediction challenges will be created based on cancer genomics datasets and patient outcomes. While there have been a few successes in predicting outcomes, current approaches suffer from reproducibility and robustness when applied to unseen data. This activity will reach a broad community of algorithm developers, promote transparency and sharing of bioinformatics code, and create a strong network effect to crowd-source the development of the best models for biological discovery. The system constructed will be focused around the investigation of cancer outcomes but the entire pipeline will be of general utility for any number of genome-based projects including investigating any number of disease, stem cell properties, model organisms, and genome-wide association studies. RELEVANCE (See instructions): While we are accumulating vast amounts of information on cancer cells, we are still searching in the dark for clues about predicting treatment strategies. It is of paramount importance to accelerate computational discovery. The creation of the BMEG will catalyze community participation to uncover novel relationships to elucidate new fundamental biology on oncogenesis and therapeutic directions for treating this disease.

"A Modular Automated Platform for Large-scale Drosophila Experiments and Handling PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Animal model systems are a powerful tool researchers use to investigate almost all aspects of biology: genetics, development, neuroscience, disease, and more. And fruit flies – Drosophila melanogaster – with their small size, easy care, and remarkable array of available genetic toolkits, occupy a sweet spot on the model organism spectrum. Over 75% of human diseases with a genetic basis have an analogue in the fly, and Drosophila have been a part of the research for six Nobel prizes. Furthermore, the advent of CRISPR/cas9 and other modern genetic tools has opened the door to modeling other diseases and pathways, leading to greater use of Drosophila for drug screens. A great deal of the work (and the majority of the budget) involved in fly experiments is tedious manual labor, and with advances in computer vision, machine learning, and other analytic techniques, the stage is set to automate many phenotypic screens. In this Phase I SBIR, we propose a robotic system – modular automated platform for large-scale experiments (MAPLE) – that can accomplish a wide variety of fly-handling tasks in Drosophila labs. This robot is the fruit fly version of a liquid handling robot, with a large, open workspace that can house a plethora of modules and several manipulators that can move small parts and animals around that workspace. Building on a collaboration between the de Bivort Lab and FlySorter completed in 2017, we will design, fabricate and validate a commercial system that can collect virgin flies, run behavioral assays, conduct drug screens, and adapt to the needs of fly labs through easy-to-code Python scripts. By strategically combining modules and instructions to the robot, MAPLE can perform a wide variety of tasks in a fly lab, saving experimentalists from repetitive chores, cutting labor costs, and increasing scientific output. Just as pipette robots have become standard equipment in wet labs, we envision our fly handling robot will be the engine that powers Drosophila labs in academia and pharma, enabling new kinds of experiments and freeing researchers from the drudgery of fly pushing. PROJECT NARRATIVE Fruit flies – Drosophila melanogaster – are a powerful model organism used in the study of disease, neuroscience, development, genetics, and recently in drug screens, too, largely through phenotypic screening. This labor-intensive work is time consuming and expensive, and ripe for automation. We propose a fly-handling robot – analogous to a liquid pipetting robot in a wet lab – that can perform a variety of tasks in Drosophila labs, free researchers from the drudgery of fly pushing, and enable a broader spectrum of experiments that will increase scientific knowledge.",A Modular Automated Platform for Large-scale Drosophila Experiments and Handling,9623017,R43MH119092,"['Affect ', ' Air ', ' Anesthesia procedures ', ' Anesthesia ', ' Animals ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Automation ', ' Behavior ', ' Biology ', ' bone ', ' Budgets ', ' Carbon Dioxide ', ' Carbonic Anhydride ', ' CO2 ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Computers ', ' Data Collection ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Drosophila genus ', ' fruit fly ', ' Drosophila ', ' Drosophila melanogaster ', ' Equipment ', ' Feedback ', ' Genetic Screening ', ' Grant ', ' Hand ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Libraries ', ' Manuals ', ' Biological Models ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Modernization ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Nobel Prize ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Phenotype ', ' Reagent ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Robotics ', ' Running ', ' Savings ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' Universities ', ' Vacuum ', ' Work ', ' Caring ', ' Custom ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Surface ', ' Phase ', ' Pythons ', ' Ensure ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' analog ', ' Collaborations ', ' Liquid substance ', ' liquid ', ' fluid ', ' Genetic ', ' Deposition ', ' Deposit ', ' Robot ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scanning ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' health science research ', ' Performance ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' Transgenic Organisms ', ' transgenic ', ' Speed ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' graduate student ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Modeling ', ' repository ', ' drug discovery ', ' Address ', ' Academia ', ' Detection ', ' Disease Pathway ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' Update ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Flies ', ' fly ', ' Output ', ' Instruction ', ' cost ', ' Behavioral Assay ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' touchscreen panel ', ' touch screen panel ', ' touch screen ', ' touch panel ', ' touchscreen ', ' human disease ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' operation ', ' screening ', ' Genetic study ', ' Cas nuclease technology ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 technology ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 ', ' CRISPR/Cas method ', ' CRISPR-based tool ', ' CRISPR-based technology ', ' CRISPR-based technique ', ' CRISPR-based method ', ' CRISPR-CAS-9 ', ' CRISPR technology ', ' CRISPR technique ', ' CRISPR methodology ', ' CRISPR method ', ' CRISPR/Cas technology ', ' robotic control ', ' robot control ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' Drug Screening ', ' ']",NIMH,"FLYSORTER, LLC",R43,2018,348007,WA-07,-0.005338451170781782
"Knowledge Management Center for Illuminating the Druggable Genome The main goal of the Knowledge Management Center (KMC) for the Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) program is to aggregate, update and articulate protein-centric data, information and knowledge for the entire human proteome with emphasis on understudied proteins from the 3 families that are the focus of the IDG (“IDG List”). The long-term objective of the KMC is to encourage and support biomedical research aimed at understudied proteins by providing an extensive resource of data, information, knowledge, methods and reagents for the entire human proteome, and to support the growing online community focused on understudied proteins. With focus on the IDG List and human proteins, the KMC will enable support for expanded coverage for non-human proteins of therapeutic interest and other associated human health data, in order to catalyze novel biomedical discoveries. To support the overall IDG objective, and to maintain, update and improve these integrated resources, the KMC draws upon expertise from multiple knowledge domains, specifically biology, chemistry and medicine, as well as computer science, graphic design and web programming. Specifically, for the Phase 2 of the IDG KMC we propose 4 Aims:1. Create an automated workflow that captures relevant public data for the entire proteome and manual annotations for the IDG list. The KMC knowledge management system will be built around knowledge graphs, focused on five major branches of the target knowledge tree, tkt: Genotype, Phenotype, Expression, Structure & Function, and Interactions & Pathways, respectively. Aim 2: Design, develop and implement a protein knowledgebase with Data Analytics support. Our protein-centric biomedical knowledge base, TCKB (Target Central Knowledgebase) will be comprised of the data, knowledge and information container, together with its codebase and software pipelines. TCKB will be the repository for experimental, processed and computed data and reagents originating from the IDG DRGCs (Data and Resource Generation Centers). We will provide informatics and modeling support for DRGC activities. Aim 3: We will expand, improve and maintain Pharos. Particularly “knowledge packages,” support automated data summaries for Protein Dossiers, and actively seek feedback from our community. Aim 4. Outreach to scientific community. We will support a series of activities that will leverage TCKB, Pharos and other IDG resources to increase adoption of IDG work, while observing FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) principles for our knowledgebase, portal and pipelines. The KMC will engage in community outreach by leading tutorials and feedback sessions and dissemination of the Pharos system. To meet its goals, the KMC will coordinate all core activities in close coordination with the IDG Steering Committee and IDG Project Scientists (PS), and include members of the IDG Consortium (IDG- C), other NIH Common Fund programs, NIH Commons, as well as other initiatives.

"Development of Machine Learning Algorithms to Assess and Train Vesico-Urethral Anastomosis during Robot Assisted Radical Prostatectomy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT CANDIDATE (Andrew J. Hung, MD): My long-term goal is to establish a career in innovating training methods for robotic surgery which will lead to curtailing surgeon learning curve, and maximize patient safety. My first step towards that goal focuses on understanding objective metrics that measure surgeon performance, and how machine learning algorithms can process that data to guide training. I have developed a career development program that builds on my clinical training in robotic urologic surgery and prior research in surgical training. Through mentorship, a fellowship, and formal coursework, this K23 award will provide me the necessary support to develop expertise in 3 areas where I do not have formal training, yet are critical to my success: (1) Machine learning; (2) Surgical education; (3) Advanced statistical skills and study design. MENTORING TEAM: My career development and research plans leverage existing institutional resources, including the USC Machine Learning Center, led by co-primary mentor Dr. Yan Liu; and Keck Hospital of USC, the second busiest robotic center by volume in the United States and the USC Institute of Urology (led by co- primary mentor and chairman Dr. Inderbir Gill), home to pioneers of several urologic surgical techniques with a robust research apparatus supporting several NIH-funded clinical scientists. My mentoring team is complemented by co-mentor Dr. Robert Sweet, a DOD-funded expert on surgical education; career mentor Dr. Larissa Rodriguez, a federally funded clinician/scientist experienced in mentoring K awardees; educational psychology collaborator Dr. Kenneth Yates, an authority on cognitive task analysis; and consultant Dr. Anthony Jarc, at Intuitive Surgical who has supported much of the pilot data on objective performance metrics. The proposed K23 work truly requires the robust collaboration of experts in robotic surgery, education, and machine learning. RESEARCH: The learning curve for surgeons performing robot assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) is steep: over 100 cases. Current ‘gold standard’ methods of surgical assessment rely on subjective expert review, but such evaluations are time consuming and inconsistent. Nonetheless, credentialing a surgeon to perform robotic surgery has enormous implications - patient outcomes are at risk, and a surgeon’s career is on the line. Informed by my clinical expertise in robotic urological surgery and preliminary data, I will develop a novel method of utilizing machine learning (ML) algorithms to objectively assess robotic surgeon performance and to guide training for the vesico-urethral anastomosis (VUA), the most critical reconstructive part of the robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). I will develop and validate objective metrics directly captured from the da Vinci robot during the VUA (Aim 1), train machine learning algorithms to assess a surgeon’s performance of VUA (Aim 2), and utilize ML algorithms to guide surgeons learning the VUA (Aim 3). Armed with these data and skills from this award, I will be uniquely suited to utilize machine learning to generalize objective surgeon assessment for robot-assisted surgical procedures within and beyond urology. Finally, the results from this study will provide preliminary data for independent funding through mechanisms such as an NIH R01 grant. PROJECT NARRATIVE The learning curve for surgeons performing robot assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) for prostate cancer is steep, and current methods of evaluating surgeons require subjective and time-consuming expert review.

"Dissecting the pathogenesis and outcomes of PSC using multi-omics by studying the exposome and genome PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The major goal of this RC2 proposal is to generate the first, multi-omics translational study capturing the sum of environmental exposures (i.e. the exposome) and comprehensive data resource for Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC), a chronic, progressive liver disease without effective medical therapy. PSC shortens survival, is associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and strongly predisposes to cholangiocarcinoma (i.e. bile duct cancer) and colon cancer. Our recent genome wide association studies (GWAS) revealed the significant role of genetic variation in PSC, while also re-emphasizing the importance of environmental factors and gene-environment interactions in PSC pathogenesis. To further elucidate the role of exposures from our external environment and lifestyle (e.g., diet, stress, toxins, drugs, microbes), we have assembled a world-class, multi-disciplinary team that synergizes expertise and resources across four institutions: Mayo Clinic, Emory University, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), and University of Oslo, Norway. Our collaborative team will leverage large clinical databases and biorepositories, as well as expertise in PSC and related conditions, exposomics, metabolomics, methylomics, transcriptomics, metagenomics, genomics, and data analytics to develop the PSC Scientific Community Resource for hypothesis-generating science and simultaneously uncover factors contributing to PSC.  We now seek to define the bigger-picture cellular networks, rather than individual genes, driving disease processes. To do so, we will use unbiased network-based approaches designed to integrate multiple layers of omics data. Our proposal is predicated on the hypothesis that multi-omics analyses of data capturing environmental exposures and the associated biological responses, including the effect on the genome, will reveal networks or pathways influencing PSC pathogenesis and outcomes. To test this hypothesis, we will perform a series of sophisticated analyses to identify PSC-associated changes in and across the exposome, metabolome, methylome, and transcriptome in blood as well as the gut metagenome, exposome and metabolome.  Our collaboration and data generation are already underway with pilot studies demonstrating differences in blood exposomes and metabolomes and stool metagenomes between PSC patients and controls. Using a suite of bioinformatic tools and available genetic variation data, we aim to discover stable, detectable, omics-based disease signatures in blood (Aim 1) and stool (Aim 2) that when integrated with clinical data (Aim 3) will reveal biological pathways driving disease pathogenesis and outcomes. All data, residual specimens, and analytical details will be made freely available to the research community in accordance with NIDDK's mission. Furthermore, this effort responds to the NIDDK's call “to better understand the role of the microbiome, genetics, and exposome.” PROJECT NARRATIVE We seek to generate the first, multi-omics translational study and comprehensive data resource for Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC), a chronic, progressive liver disease without medical therapy.

"Developing a mechanistic neurobiological model of exposure therapy response based on fear extinction theory Project Summary I am applying for a Mentored Patient-Oriented Career Development Award (K23) to support my development into an independently funded translational clinical psychologist. My long-term career goal is to conduct a program of research that translates neurobiological models of anxiety and its treatment into guidance for real- life clinical decision-making. Currently, although exposure therapy is the best available treatment for anxiety disorders, 25% of patients do not respond to an adequate course of exposure therapy and we do not know why. A critical long-term goal is to improve exposure therapy response by tailoring therapy based on the neurobiological profile of each patient. Because the mechanism of exposure therapy is thought to be extinction learning, the proposed research aims to address this goal by directly linking exposure therapy response to extinction learning in a sample of adults with social anxiety disorder. Specifically, I aim to identify neurobiological features of extinction learning that predict successful recall, are associated with clinical symptoms, and predict therapy response. The project will use a paradigm that I developed and piloted to assess physiological and neuroimaging measures of extinction learning. The expected outcomes are an innovative mechanistic neurobiological model that can identify patients at risk of non-response, as well as specific, testable hypotheses for how to improve outcomes for these patients. In order for this project, and my broader career goals, to succeed, it is imperative that I have expertise related to exposure therapy, predictive modeling, analysis of self-report, physiological, and fMRI data, and traditional and biomarker-guided clinical trial designs. I already have expertise in the theory and implementation of exposure therapy, as well as the analysis of self-report and fMRI data. This K23 award would allow me to receive advanced training in (1) machine learning techniques for building and evaluating clinically relevant predictive models, (2) specific skills for analysis and interpretation of physiological data, and (3) traditional and biomarker-guided clinical trials. I have assembled an inter-disciplinary team of mentors at Stanford University that are ideally suited to guide my research and training. Dr. Leanne Williams (primary mentor, Department of Psychiatry) will provide expertise on using neurobiology to make treatment outcome predictions, and provide overall career development mentorship throughout the project. Dr. James Gross (co-mentor, Department of Psychology) will provide expertise on physiological data and its integration with self-report and fMRI data. Dr. Tze Lai (co-mentor, Department of Statistics) will provide expertise on predictive models and biomarker-guided clinical trial designs. The training and associated research will take place in the Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences Department at Stanford University, a world renowned hub of neuroscience and psychiatry research, and at Stanford's Center for Cognitive and Neurobiological Imaging, a state-of-the-art neuroimaging facility. Project Narrative Social anxiety disorder affects as many as 12% of Americans, resulting in significant distress and disability. Although exposure therapy is one of the best treatments available, as many as 25% of patients do not respond and we do not know why. Extinction learning is thought to be the mechanism of exposure therapy, and the neuroscience of extinction learning has advanced significantly since exposure therapy was developed; however, there has been little application towards improved clinical outcomes. This project aims to improve exposure therapy response for patients with social anxiety disorder by directly linking exposure therapy response to the neurobiology of extinction learning.",Developing a mechanistic neurobiological model of exposure therapy response based on fear extinction theory,9526722,K23MH113708,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdala ', ' Animals ', ' Anxiety ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Extinction (Psychology) ', ' behavioral extinction ', ' Extinction ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Future ', ' Galvanic Skin Response ', ' skin conductance ', ' Skin Electric Conductance ', ' Psychogalvanic Reflex ', ' Electrodermal Response ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Laboratories ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Physiology ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Psychologist ', ' Psychology ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' statistics ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' waitlist ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Mediating ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Loudness ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Anterior ', ' Dorsal ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Distress ', ' learning extinction ', ' Funding ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Exposure to ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Severities ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Techniques ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' American ', ' cingulate cortex ', ' skills ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' K23 Program ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Award ', ' Prediction of Response to Therapy ', ' treatment response prediction ', ' treatment prediction ', ' therapy prediction ', ' predict treatment response ', ' predict therapy response ', ' predict therapeutic response ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Research Training ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' Cognitive ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' scientific advances ', ' scientific accomplishments ', ' Scientific Advances and Accomplishments ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Outcome ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' unique treatment ', ' tailored treatment ', ' tailored therapy ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' individualized treatment ', ' individualized therapy ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' customized treatment ', ' customized therapy ', ' individualized medicine ', ' predictive molecular biomarker ', ' predictive biomarkers ', ' predictive marker ', ' anxious symptom ', ' anxiety symptoms ', ' social anxiety ', ' Social Anxiety Disorder ', ' treatment of anxiety disorders ', ' anxious individuals ', ' anxious ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' outcome prediction ', ' improved outcome ', ' recruit ', ' responsive patient ', ' patient response ', ' ']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K23,2018,186408,CA-18,-0.013298024673205133

"Reactome: An Open Knowledgebase of Human Pathways Project Summary  We seek renewal of the core operating funding for the Reactome Knowledgebase of Human Biological Pathways and Processes. Reactome is a curated, open access biomolecular pathway database that can be freely used and redistributed by all members of the biological research community. It is used by clinicians, geneti- cists, genomics researchers, and molecular biologists to interpret the results of high-throughput experimental studies, by bioinformaticians seeking to develop novel algorithms for mining knowledge from genomic studies, and by systems biologists building predictive models of normal and disease variant pathways.  Our curators, PhD-level scientists with backgrounds in cell and molecular biology work closely with in- dependent investigators within the community to assemble machine-readable descriptions of human biological pathways. Each pathway is extensively checked and peer-reviewed prior to publication to ensure its assertions are backed up by the primary literature, and that human molecular events inferred from orthologous ones in animal models have an auditable inference chain. Curated Reactome pathways currently cover 8930 protein- coding genes (44% of the translated portion of the genome) and ~150 RNA genes. We also offer a network of reliable ‘functional interactions’ (FIs) predicted by a conservative machine-learning approach, which covers an additional 3300 genes, for a combined coverage of roughly 60% of the known genome.  Over the next five years, we will: (1) curate new macromolecular entities, clinically significant protein sequence variants and isoforms, and drug-like molecules, and the complexes these entities form, into new reac- tions; (2) supplement normal pathways with alternative pathways targeted to significant diseases and devel- opmental biology; (3) expand and automate our tools for curation, management and community annotation; (4) integrate pathway modeling technologies using probabilistic graphical models and Boolean networks for pathway and network perturbation studies; (5) develop additional compelling software interfaces directed at both computational and lab biologist users; and (6) and improve outreach to bioinformaticians, molecular bi- ologists and clinical researchers. Project Narrative  Reactome represents one of a very small number of open access curated biological pathway databases. Its authoritative and detailed content has directly and indirectly supported basic and translational research studies with over-representation analysis and network-building tools to discover patterns in high-throughput data.

"Knowledge Management Center for Illuminating the Druggable Genome SUMMARY The understudied protein targets that are the focus of the implementation phase of the Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) project need to be placed in the contexts of gene-sets/pathways, drugs/small-molecules, diseases/phenotypes, and cells/tissues. By extending our previous methods, we will impute knowledge about the understudied potential target protein kinases, GPCRs, and ion channels listed in the RFA using machine learning strategies. To establish this classification system, we will organize data from many omics- and literature- based resources into attribute tables where genes are the rows and their attributes are the columns. Examples of such attribute tables include gene or protein expression in cancer cell lines (CCLE) or human tissues (GTEx), changes in expression in response to drug perturbations or single-gene knockdowns (LINCS), regulation by transcription factors based on ChIP-seq data (ENCODE), and phenotypes in mice observed when single genes are knocked out (KOMP). In total, we will process and abstract data from over 100 resources. We will then predict target functions, target association with pathways, small-molecules/drugs that modulate the activity and expression of the target, and target relevance to human disease. To further validate such predictions, we will employ text mining to identify knowledge that corroborates with the data mining predictions, perform molecular docking of predicted small molecules using homology modeling, and seek associations between variants and human diseases by mining electronic medical records (EMR) together with genomic profiling of thousands of patients. In addition, we will develop innovative data visualization tools to allow users to interact with all the collected data, and develop social networking software to build communities centered around proteins/genes/targets as well as biological topics including pathways, cell types, drugs/small-molecules, and diseases. Overall, we will develop an invaluable resource that will accelerate target and drug discovery. NARRATIVE The Knowledge Management Center (KMC) for the Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) project will facilitate translational research by integrating and mining data about understudied druggable targets from numerous repositories and other resources. The KMC for IDG team will develop novel tools to analyze these data for the purpose of finding connections between genes/proteins/targets and diseases/phenotypes, cells/tissues, pathways/gene-sets, and drugs/small-molecules in order to identify potential applications to treat diseases and for other biological contexts of clinical relevance.",Knowledge Management Center for Illuminating the Druggable Genome,9453421,U24CA224260,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Award ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Data Collection ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Ion Channel ', ' Membrane Channels ', ' Ionic Channels ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Methods ', ' Mining ', ' Mus ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Online Systems ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Paper ', ' Patients ', ' Peer Review ', ' Phenotype ', ' Phosphotransferases ', ' Transphosphorylases ', ' Phosphotransferase Gene ', ' Kinases ', ' Protein Kinase ', ' phosphorylase b kinase kinase ', ' hydroxyalkyl protein kinase ', ' glycogen synthase a kinase ', ' Kinase Family Gene ', ' ATP-protein phosphotransferase ', ' Proteins ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publishing ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Supervision ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' transcription factor ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Work ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Generations ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Social Network ', ' Public Domains ', ' base ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Null Mouse ', ' Knock-out Mice ', ' KO mice ', ' Knockout Mice ', ' Link ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' Gene Targeting ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' human tissue ', ' cell type ', ' System ', ' Visit ', ' success ', ' novel ', ' Graph ', ' outreach ', ' Information Resources Management ', ' Knowledge Management ', ' Gene Proteins ', ' Protein Gene Products ', ' response ', ' repository ', ' Adverse effects ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' drug discovery ', ' Transcriptional Regulation ', ' Transcriptional Control ', ' Transcription Regulation ', ' computerized data processing ', ' data processing ', ' protein expression ', ' text searching ', ' text mining ', ' literature searching ', ' literature mining ', ' discovery mining ', ' small molecule ', ' data mining ', ' datamining ', ' Data ', ' Homology Modeling ', ' Reproducibility ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research ', ' Update ', ' Molecular ', ' Knockout ', ' Knock-out ', ' Process ', ' Docking ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' disease phenotype ', ' knockdown ', ' knock-down ', ' data integration ', ' visualization tool ', ' Visualization software ', ' Cancer cell line ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' human disease ', ' biorepository ', ' biobank ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing ', ' ChIP Sequencing ', ' ChIP-seq ', ' data visualization ', ' community center ', ' virtual community ', ' online community ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' genomic profiles ', ' GTEx ', ' Genotype-Tissue Expression Project ', ' patient profile ', ' profiles in patients ', ' Trends over time ', ' Temporal trend ', ' Time trend ', ' data resource ', ' druggable target ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' ']",NCI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U24,2018,249999,NY-13,-0.012313245557353055
"2018 Image Science Gordon Research Conference & Gordon Research Seminar Project Summary: The proposal requests support for early-career investigators to attend the 2018 Gordon Research Conference on Image Science. The unique feature of this conference in its third offering compared with others in medical imaging is the bringing together of renown speakers from disparate application areas, including astronomy, biology, medicine, remote sensing, and security and defense industries, in a forum that encourages each to describe their greatest challenges and most promising solutions. All speakers are invited based on their leadership in their field and their willingness to debate fundamental issues shared by everyone developing, evaluating, and applying imaging in medicine and biology.

"Using clinical data to identify FDA-approved drugs for cancer prevention and therapeutic repurposing Project Summary/Abstract Clinical data collection is accelerating rapidly, and in the future it will include both provider- and patient- generated data. Hidden within this mass of noisy observational data are clues as to factors influencing disease onset and outcome. Finding ways to exploit this trove of disease data can unlock a new perspective on disease processes. We can tackle disease both from the bottom-up, from experimental data generated in the laboratory, and from the top down, from clinical phenomena observed across human populations. A particularly impactful and prevalent disease is cancer. Each tumor harbors a unique combination of mutations driving a distinct set of oncogenic processes. Targeted therapies have been proposed to pinpoint these mutations, potentially requiring a vast array of therapeutic options. Cancer treatment often fails when drug resistance arises, another result of the complex combinatorial nature of tumor alterations. Combination therapies have been proposed as an approach to interfere with multiple disease signals simultaneously. However, identifying effective drug combinations, and the cancer types in which they are effective, is experimentally infeasible, leading to a push for computational solutions. In this proposal, we combine methods from social sciences and biostatistics to find the causal effect of a drug on cancer onset from observational clinical data. Both increased and decreased cancer rates in drug-takers are of equal interest, as they can inform us of disease processes and provide clinical impact. We are particularly interested in finding drug combinations that impact cancer. These combination effects are unlikely to have been detected, and our clinical data provides a unique resource for observing the effects of tens of thousands of drug combinations. We will pool the resulting causal drug effect estimates across the many cancers present in our data. To gain insight into the cellular processes underlying clinical effect, we will examine the impact of known cancer-causing drugs in vitro, using large public cell line assays. The accompanying goal is to provide Dr. Rachel Melamed with a career development experience to become an independent scientist. Her research will use observational health data to understand the genesis of cancer, prevent the disease, and discover new therapeutic options. This proposal takes advantage of the interdisciplinary strengths of the University of Chicago in computation, biostatistics, and medicine, as well as institutional resources in terms of data access and infrastructure. Dr. Melamed has assembled a team consisting of complementary mentors and collaborators with expertise in computation, statistics, translational medicine, personalized therapy, and cancer therapy. The career development plan focuses on enhancing her statistics and machine learning skills with structured coursework and mentorship, and gaining experience in biomedical applications via applied work and mentorship. This will provide Dr. Melamed with skills to model observational data and to integrate the results with experimental data. Project Narrative Clinical data has been shown to hold patterns relating drugs to cancer onset.

"Spatial Genomics for in situ single cell expression analysis in the brain Summary Identifying the spatial organization of tissues at cellular resolution from single cell gene expression profiles is essential to understanding neurological systems. We have developed a spatial genomics approach that allows in situ 3D multiplexed imaging of many genes in single cells called sequential Fluorescence in situ hybridization (seqFISH). This technology can profile transcriptional states of single cells directly in their native tissue context with up to 249 genes multiplexed with single molecule sensitivity on each gene. We have demonstrated over 15,000 cells profiled in mouse brain slices. This SBIR project will be focused on the design, production and optimization of an instrument that allows hundreds of genes to be multiplexed and imaged in single cells within their native tissue context. The resulting machine will be commercially launched and targeted to imaging or sequencing cores at research institutions. We will design the hardware, code the control software, and build the prototype instrument. We will engineer the hardware component including automated fluidics and multiple camera imaging system with a parallel effort to develop software controls as well as integrated analysis tools. In phase II, we will beta-test the instrument, generate probe sets for gene panels targeting different brain samples, and receive valuable feedback from users and optimize our instrument design. Narrative A major challenge of the BRAIN initiative and international Human Cell Atlas project is to identifying distinct cell populations in the brain within their native spatial environment. Addressing this challenge is essential not only to fundamental biological questions of understanding how different cell types interact to form neural circuits, but also essential in investigating mechanisms of human diseases where small subpopulations of cells, such as microglial, play pivotal roles. We have developed an in situ 3D multiplexed imaging method called sequential Fluorescence in situ hybridization (seqFISH), that can profile transcriptional states of single cells directly in a mouse coronal section with up to 249 genes multiplexed in the hippocampus and the cortex (Shah et al., Neuron 2016, Frieda et al., Nature 2016). Delivering this technology as a robust platform that can be used by neuroscientists would enable breakthrough discoveries and treatment options. To make this technology available for a broad range of users and customers, this phase I SBIR project will be focused on the design, production and optimization of an instrument called seqFISH100 and the parallel development of the control software to operate the seqFISH100.",Spatial Genomics for in situ single cell expression analysis in the brain,9559516,R43MH115538,"['Adoption ', ' Algorithms ', ' Atlases ', ' Automation ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Feedback ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hippocampus ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hypothalamic structure ', ' hypothalamic ', ' Hypothalamus ', ' Institutes ', ' Methods ', ' Mus ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Neuroglia ', ' nerve cement ', ' Non-neuronal cell ', ' Neuroglial Cells ', "" Kolliker's reticulum "", ' Glial Cells ', ' Glia ', ' Neurons ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Play ', ' Production ', ' Reagent ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Work ', ' Custom ', ' Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization ', ' FISH assay ', ' FISH analysis ', ' FISH Technique ', ' FISH Technic ', ' Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization ', ' base ', ' Microscope ', ' Site ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Measurement ', ' Clinical Pathways ', ' Liquid substance ', ' liquid ', ' fluid ', ' Effector Cell ', ' Contracts ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' tool ', ' instrument ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' In Situ ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' neural circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' Sampling ', ' software development ', ' developing computer software ', ' develop software ', ' single molecule ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Genomics ', ' Manufacturer Name ', ' Manufacturer ', ' Drops ', ' Institution ', ' imaging modality ', ' imaging method ', ' image-based method ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' Address ', ' DNA Sequencing Facility ', ' Sequencing Core ', ' International ', ' Resolution ', ' Slice ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' touchscreen panel ', ' touch screen panel ', ' touch screen ', ' touch panel ', ' touchscreen ', ' visualization tool ', ' Visualization software ', ' scale up ', ' Population ', ' user-friendly ', ' human disease ', ' fluorescent imaging ', ' fluorescence imaging ', ' prototype ', ' operation ', ' genomic strategy ', ' genomic effort ', ' Genomic approach ', ' data visualization ', ' BRAIN initiative ', ' imaging system ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' ']",NIMH,"SPATIAL GENOMICS, INC.",R43,2018,885468,CA-27,-0.02082518040279404
"Elucidating the Role of the Genetic and Environmental Determinants of Preterm Birth Using Integrative Computational Approaches ABSTRACT Given the wealth and availability of genomic and environmental exposure data, computational methods provide a powerful opportunity to identify population-specific determinants of disease. Proper treatment of data types emerging from a diverse set of molecular and environmental profiling technologies cannot be analyzed using traditional statistical routines and new computational approaches are needed. In line with the President's Precision Medicine Initiative, the goal of this proposal is to develop computational methods and integrate large- scale genetic and environmental exposure datasets to elucidate factors that affect preterm birth (PTB) in diverse populations. Preterm birth, or the delivery of an infant prior to 37 weeks of gestation, is a major health concern. Infants born prematurely, comprising of about 12% of the US newborns, have elevated risks of neonatal mortality and a wide array of health problems. Preterm birth rates vary among different ethnic groups, with frequencies significantly elevated in African Americans and moderately elevated in Hispanics in comparison to Europeans. Environmental and socioeconomic factors alone may not explain these disparities and despite the evidence for a genetic basis to preterm birth, to date no causal genetic variants have been identified. In this proposal I aim to leverage the rich genetic and environmental variation data and develop computational approaches to advance our understanding of biology of preterm birth as it relates to all populations. To that extent, I propose three aims. In aim 1, I will develop computational methods to identify and validate novel genetic factors for preterm birth by genome-wide association (GWA) study in diverse ethnic populations. I obtained a comprehensive set of publicly available PTB case and control datasets consisting of ethnically diverse mothers and babies including 3,500 cases and nearly 16,000 controls from dbGAP and will carry out an ancestry-based case-control GWA study to identify genetic factors influencing PTB. In aim 2, I will develop analytical methodology to identify environmental and socioeconomic factors that impact preterm birth in diverse ethnic populations. I propose to integrate linked California State databases covering over 3 million births across diverse populations with geographical location data and pollution levels and UV exposure data from the Environmental Protection Agency in order to identify whether these exposures play a role in contributing to population-specific PTB risk. In aim 3, I will carry out integrative data analysis and build computational models in order to identify population specific interactions between the genetic and environmental factors affecting PTB risk. I hypothesize that gene-environment interactions contribute to population differences in preterm birth risk following environmental exposures. The proposed work will allow us to learn more about the etiology PTB, but could also be extended to other phenotypes of interest. This project is the logical next step for the study of the interaction of genetics and environment in the context of disease, which can be used to inform precise population-specific diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Given the wealth and availability of genomic and environmental exposure data, computational methods provide a powerful opportunity to identify population-specific determinants of disease. The goal of this proposal is to develop computational approaches to integrate diverse genetic and environmental exposure datasets to elucidate factors that affect disease in diverse populations and apply them to the study of preterm birth.

"Niche signals in HSC genesis PROJECT SUMMARY Hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) have well established clinical applications in the treatment of heritable and acquired blood disorders. However, their therapeutic potential could be significantly broadened by engineering novel methods to generate HSC de novo from pluripotent stem cells or from directly reprogrammed adult cells. Toward this goal, we have established endothelial cell (EC) niche based culture methods that provide the necessary conditions to support the specification and self-renewal of HSC from embryonic hemogenic precursors, and more recently, from adult ECs using transcription factor (TF)-mediated conversion that bypasses a pluripotent intermediate. We hypothesize that recreating the signals necessary and sufficient to develop a clinically meaningful system for HSC generation in vitro will necessitate a comprehensive, systems approach to deconstruct the niche provided signals required for HSC specification and self-renewal. Thus, the overall goal of this grant is to leverage unique expertise of the collaborating laboratories to elucidate the signaling interactions regulating HSC specification and self-renewal from embryonic hemogenic precursors or TF-reprogrammed adult EC in the context of the EC niche. Our approach consists of three overlapping aims. The first aim will identify EC niche-provided signals necessary for embryonic HSC specification and self-renewal. The second aim will identify the unique HSC programs induced by these signals that regulate the transition from embryonic hemogenic precursor to bone fide repopulating HSC. The third will identify comparable programs that regulate the transition from adult EC to HSC during TF-mediated reprogramming in the EC niche. Key to these studies will be innovative functional assays, transcriptional profiling methods, and computational approaches that will enable us to resolve cellular complexity of niche cells and their interactions with developing embryonic or reprogrammed HSC at the single cell level. The role of identified signal factors in stage-specific support of HSC specification will be validated and further refined in vitro by gain and loss of function studies in the context of niche EC. Furthermore, to extend these studies to stromal cell-free systems as a step toward clinical translation, we will also test the contribution of identified signal factors in HSC specification and self-renewal in the context of stage-specific modulation of Notch activation using engineered Notch agonists. To achieve the goals of this proposal, we have developed a multidisciplinary collaboration involving unique expertise in each of our laboratories, including basic HSC and EC niche cell biology, direct TF based cellular conversion, clinical HSC transplantation, genome wide assessment of rare stem cell populations at single cell resolution, and innovative computational approaches to deconstruct core signal pathways regulating developmental transitions. Altogether, we expect the proposed studies will ultimately guide the design of novel strategies for deriving and expanding HSC in vitro for therapeutic applications. NARRATIVE Hematopoietic stem cells are currently used in the treatment and cure of a variety of blood disorders. Methods to generate new or greater numbers of hematopoietic stem cells in the laboratory could expand the availability and therapeutic applications of these valuable cells, but currently such methods are lacking. The goal of this proposal is to use lessons from endothelial cells, which provide critical signals to support hematopoietic stem cells, to engineer novel systems for the development and expansion of hematopoietic stem cells in culture. !",Niche signals in HSC genesis,9547399,RC2DK114777,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Algorithms ', ' Aorta ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' blastomere structure ', ' Embryonic Cell ', ' Blastocytes ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' bone ', ' Cell Culture Techniques ', ' cell culture ', ' Cell-Free System ', ' Cellfree System ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Embryo ', ' Embryonic ', ' Embryonic Development ', ' Embryogenesis ', ' Embryo Development ', ' Engineering ', ' Goals ', ' Gonadal structure ', ' gonads ', ' gonad ', ' Grant ', ' Hematological Disease ', ' blood disorder ', ' Hematological Disorder ', ' Hematologic Diseases ', ' Blood Diseases ', ' Hematopoietic stem cells ', ' hematopoietic stem progenitor cell ', ' hematopoietic progenitor ', ' Hematopoietic Progenitor Cells ', ' Blood Precursor Cell ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' In Vitro ', ' indexing ', ' Laboratories ', ' Mesonephric structure ', ' Wolffian Body ', ' Mesonephros ', ' Methods ', ' Physiological Processes ', ' Physiologic Processes ', ' Organismal Process ', ' Organism-Level Process ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Testing ', ' transcription factor ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' Generations ', ' notch protein ', ' notch receptors ', ' notch ', ' Mediating ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Stromal Cells ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Endothelial Cells ', ' insight ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant ', ' HSC transplantation ', ' Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation ', ' Agonist ', ' Coculture ', ' Cocultivation ', ' Co-culture ', ' Coculture Techniques ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Cellular biology ', ' cell biology ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' embryonic stem cell ', ' stem cell of embryonic origin ', ' ES cell ', ' receptor ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' novel ', ' Sorting - Cell Movement ', ' sorting ', ' Bypass ', ' Gene Expression Profiling ', ' transcriptional profiling ', ' gene expression assay ', ' gene expression analysis ', ' Transcript Expression Analysis ', ' Transcript Expression Analyses ', ' Gene Expression Pattern Analysis ', ' Gene Expression Monitoring ', ' Pluripotent Stem Cells ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Address ', ' Molecular Analysis ', ' Resolution ', ' Stem Cell Development ', ' in vivo ', ' Signaling Molecule ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' stem cell specification ', ' stem cell fate specification ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Heritability ', ' clinical applicability ', ' clinical application ', ' loss of function ', ' self-renew ', ' self-renewal ', ' stem ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' genome-wide ', ' stem cell population ', ' Systems Development ', ' clinical translation ', ' single cell RNA-seq ', ' scRNA-seq ', ' single-cell RNA sequencing ', ' ']",NIDDK,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,RC2,2018,644332,WA-07,-0.003953525454029172
"Statistical Modeling of Multiparental and Genetic Reference Populations PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Genetic crosses in model organisms play an essential role in understanding how heritable factors affect medically relevant traits. Such crosses have traditionally tended to be on a small scale with limited power to detect genetic effects, limited ability to localize causal variants, and limited options for replication. In the last decade, however, the emergence of larger-scale interdisciplinary research, cheaper genotyping and parallel advances in human genetics, has spurred the development of more sophisticated and powerful experimental designs. Foremost are those that incorporate two modern genetic design concepts: the multiparental population (MPP), whereby each subject is descended from a small, well-characterized set of genetically diverse inbred strains, with the goal of efﬁciently exploring a wide genetic landscape; and the genetic reference population (GRP), whereby subjects are drawn from a large and genetically diverse set of inbred strains, with the goal that the study population, and thereby the studies themselves, can be inﬁnitely replicated. Their combination, the multiparental genetic refer- ence population (MP-GRP), represents the state-of-the-art in complex trait genetics and has been implemented in a number of model organisms, including plants, ﬂies, and rodents.  The proposed program of research focuses on the development of statistical and computational tools to advance the design and analysis of studies using MPPs, GRPs and MP-GRPs. It centers around addressing three interconnected questions.  1) How to take advantage of biological replicates in a genetically varying population? Directions consid- ered include: more stable methods to detect genetically-induced phenotypic outliers; use of genetically-induced heteroskedasticity to improve statistical power and ﬁnd variance-controlling genes; and more rigorous and ex- pansive characterization of gene-by-treatment effects by using principles from causal inference.  2) How to navigate the complex design space of MP-GRPs and their derived crosses? Directions considered include: use of decision theory applied to Bayesian analysis of pilot data; incorporation of variance heterogeneity to control likely reproducibility.  3) How to approach quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis in MPPs and MP-GRPs? Directions considered in- clude: making haplotype-based association more robust to uncertainty in haplotype state; combining haplotype- based with variant-based mapping; adaptive modeling of QTL complexity; machine learning of the allelic series; familywise error rate control through descent-based permutation.  Progress on these fronts will not only ﬁll signiﬁcant gaps in studies using MPPs, GRPs and MP-GRPs, but will also provide tools and insights that will allow these designs to be used in new and more powerful ways. PROJECT NARRATIVE (RELEVANCE) The proposed research will lead to improvements in the analysis and design of genetic studies on experimental models of human disease. Because the project focuses on statistical methodology applied to experimental model organism populations (including mouse, rats and Drosophila) the scientiﬁc output of the project is expected to be applicable to basic research focusing on any medical condition that can be studied in model organisms.",Statistical Modeling of Multiparental and Genetic Reference Populations,9485688,R35GM127000,"['Affect ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Genetic Crosses ', ' Decision Theory ', ' Drosophila genus ', ' fruit fly ', ' Drosophila ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Genes ', ' Population Genetics ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Haplotypes ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Human Genetics ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Statistical Models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Modernization ', ' Mus ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Phenotype ', ' Plants ', ' Play ', ' Rattus ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Rat ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Research ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Rodentia ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Experimental Models ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' insight ', ' Bayesian statistics ', ' Bayesian statistical inference ', ' Bayesian statistical analysis ', ' Bayesian spatial analysis ', ' Bayesian network analysis ', ' Bayesian inference ', ' Bayesian Analysis ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Quantitative Trait Loci ', ' QTL ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' trait ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Modeling ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Inbred Strain ', ' Reproducibility ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Output ', ' Complex Genetic Trait ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' Heritability ', ' treatment effect ', ' human disease ', ' Genetic study ', ' study population ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R35,2018,336445,NC-04,-0.0253641931283459
"The Center for Innovation in Intensive Longitudinal Studies (CIILS) PROJECT SUMMARY Significance. The Intensive Longitudinal Behavior Network (ILHBN) provides an unprecedented opportunity to advance and shape the future landscape of health behavior science and related intervention practice. The proposed Research Coordinating Center, the Center for Innovation in Intensive Longitudinal Studies (CIILS), housed at the Pennsylvania State University (Penn State), will bring together an interdisciplinary team to synergistically support and coordinate research activities across a diverse portfolio of anticipated U01 projects to accomplish the Network’s larger goal of sustained innovation in the use of intensive longitudinal data (ILD) and associated methods in the study of health behavior change, and in informing prevention and intervention designs. Innovation. The proposed organizational structure of the ILHBN as a small-world network is motivated by our team’s collective decades of experience with multidisciplinary and multi-site collaborations, and is designed to facilitate information flow, collective decision making, and coordination of goals and effort within the ILHBN.

"Phamarcogenomics of Statin Therapy (SUPPLEMENT) PARENT ABSTRACT The overall objective of the Center ""Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy"" (POST) is to apply genomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic analyses, together with studies in cellular and animal models, and innovative informatic tools, to identify and validate biomarkers for efficacy of statin drugs in reducing risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), and for adverse effects of statins, specifically myopathy and type 2 diabetes. This multidisciplinary approach is enabled by a team of investigators with expertise in genomics (human, mouse, and molecular), statistics and informatics, and clinical medicine and pharmacology. The Center is comprised of three Projects, two Research Cores, and an Administrative Core. A major aim of Project 1 is the identification of cellular transcriptomic and metabolomic markers for clinical efficacy and adverse effects of statins. This will be accomplished by analyses in statin-exposed lymphoblast cell lines derived from patients with major adverse coronary events, or onset of myopathy or type 2 diabetes on statin treatment, compared with unaffected statin-treated controls. In addition, using genome wide genotypes from these patients, DNA variants will be identified that are associated with statin-induced changes in the transcripts and metabolites that most strongly discriminate affected patients and controls. Project 2 will use a unique, well- characterized panel of 100 inbred mouse strains to discover genetic variation associated with statin- induced myopathy and dysglycemia. Mechanisms underlying these effects will be investigated, with emphasis on the role of dysregulation of autophagy by statin treatment. Projects 1 and 2 will also use relevant cellular and mouse models, respectively, to perform functional studies to validate effects of genes identified in all POST projects as strong candidates for modulating statin efficacy or adverse effects. In Project 3, information derived from genome-wide genotypes, electronic health records, and pharmacy data in a very large and diverse population-based patient cohort will be leveraged to identify and replicate genetic associations with statin efficacy (lipid lowering and CVD event reduction) and adverse effects (myopathy and type 2 diabetes), as well as to assess the overall heritability of these responses. The Clinical Core, based in Kaiser Permanente of Northern California, will provide the clinical information and biologic materials for both Projects 1 and 3. Investigators in the Informatics Core will optimize data analysis and integration of results across all projects. The Administrative Core will provide scientific leadership and management of the Center, and foster scientific interactions and training opportunities. Overall, the research program of this Center provides an innovative model for a ""systems"" approach to pharmacogenomics that incorporates complementary investigative tools to discover and validate genetically influenced determinants of drug response. Moreover, the findings have the potential for guiding more effective use of statins for reducing CVD risk and minimizing adverse effects, and identifying biomarkers of pathways that modulate the multiple actions of this widely used class of drugs. ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPLEMENT ABSTRACT In response to NOT-AG-18-008, our goal is to extend the validation and application of our data integration methodologies into Alzheimer’s disease research. This administrative supplement is designed to extend the work of the existing subaward to the University of Pennsylvania subcontract for the POST Informatics Core. The PGRN POST Informatics Core serves as the central hub for data sharing and coordination across the three POST projects in the PGRN P50 award. One of our jobs is annotating the extensive information that will be collected and providing analysis expertise to the projects as needed. However, to make great strides in scientific progress and ensure that the collective whole of the Center is greater than the sum of the parts, a key function of the Informatics Core is to serve as ‘The Integrator’ to combine these data and information. We and others have shown that integration of complementary omics-based data can provide emergent insights into biological processes compared to what can be learned through any single approach alone. The methods that we are developing to integrate data for statin pharmacogenomic phenotypes will be equally applicable in the area of Alzheimer’s disease. Additionally, recent emphasis on open data science by Alzheimer’s disease researchers provides ample data for us to interrogate our method. We have developed novel statistical analysis tools such as the Analysis Tool for Heritable and Environmental Network Associations (ATHENA), and data visualization tools, such as PhenoGram, both of which are designed to collect and combine information from diverse data sources. With these tools, we will leverage publicly available Alzheimer’s disease datasets to maximize the knowledge gleaned about disease risk for Alzheimer’s diseases. The methodologies that we have been developing as part of the PGRN POST award for the past 2.5 years are clearly applicable to the study of Alzheimer’s disease risk. An important validation step of the application of our methodologies is to apply them to different types of datasets and in different phenotypic areas. This administrative supplement focused on extended research into having an Alzheimer’s disease focus is a great mechanism to simultaneously allow us to validate our methodologies with different types of data and potentially identify important risk factors and pathways toward a better understanding of the etiology of Alzheimer’s disease. Finally, we may have the opportunity to identify cross biological implications due to the known pleiotropic relationships between Alzheimer’s disease and cardiovascular disease.

"SPORE in Skin Cancer The incidence of melanoma has risen dramatically in recent years, but no therapy has improved overall survival for the majority of patients with unresectable metastatic disease. The University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute (UPCI) Melanoma and Skin Cancer Program (MSCP) will continue to conduct a Specialized Program of Research Excellence (SPORE) to improve our understanding of molecular and immunologic mechanisms of cancer progression and to validate prognostic and predictive biomarkers for personalized treatment of advanced melanoma and cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL). Of our 4 Projects, 1 is continued from the prior funding period, and 3 new projects have been derived from developmental research conducted in the last period; 1 of the prior SPORE projects will be continued with independent ROI funding. Our highly integrated approach leverages complementary expertise in melanoma, oncology, dermatology, immunology, biostatistics, bioinformatics, machine learning, genomics, proteomics, and biomarker discovery to test hypotheses central to the improvement of therapeutic outcome in skin cancers. Regardless of clinical outcomes, these Projects will also generate urgently needed mechanistic data to inform development of new therapeutic strategies and pathways through which to monitor relapse and progression. Our 4 Projects will evaluate: (1) the prognostic and predictive value of the pro-inflammatory response and markers of immune suppression in relation to ipilimumab and interferon (IFN)¿ adjuvant therapy (leveraging an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group-led adjuvant trial); (2) an engineered, 3-antigen dendritic cell vaccine and IFN¿ boost in patients with metastatic melanoma; (3) the safety and efficacy of vemurafenib modulation of immunotherapy with IFN¿2b in patients with metastatic melanoma; and (4) an entirely new personalized microneedle vaccination technology in patients with melanoma and CTCL. The Administrative Core (A) coordinates the clinical research and provides scientific and fiscal oversight of the entire SPORE. The Biospecimen Core (B) is housed in the UPCI Immunologic Monitoring and Cellular Products Laboratory, where all tissue banking, biospecimen processing, and immune assays are conducted. The Biostatistics Core (C) and Informatics Core (D) support all projects with data analysis and management, respectively. We will continue to solicit, review, and fund applications for the career development and developmental research programs, which in the prior funding period led to the design of a new full project in this application (Project 3)  and the promotion of career development recipients to co-investigators and a project leader. The goal of this application is to use a multi-disciplinary approach to improve outcomes in skin cancer and in particular, metastatic melanoma, a disease with a 15% 5-year survival rate. We will improve treatment and outcomes for skin cancer patients by identifying new ways to treat the disease based on the biology of the individual patient's tumor and new biomarkers that predict risk and response to therapy to prevent recurrence based on an individual patient's genetics and the tumor impact upon the microenvironment.",SPORE in Skin

"HERCULES: Exposome Research Center PROJECT SUMMARY: HERCULES The vision of the HERCULES P30 is to demonstrably advance the role of environmental health sciences in clinical and public health settings using the platform of the exposome. Healthcare and biomedical research have become increasingly genome-centric. While much of this is due to the impressive achievements in genomics, which have consistently outpaced gains in environmental health, it is our contention that a more persuasive case needs to be made for environmental factors. Science and intuition support the idea that the environment plays just as large of a role as genetics for the majority of diseases. The exposome, which embraces a strategy and scale similar to genomic research, is poised to elevate the environment in discussions of health and disease. We will continue to grow and enhance the environmental health science research portfolio at Emory through cutting-edge technologies and innovative data solutions. We will build upon the superb relationships we have built with the local community and continue to push the mission of NIEHS on campus and across the scientific landscape. Based on the extraordinary progress over our first three years, we propose to retain our theme to use exposome-related concepts and approaches to improve human health. This simple and unifying vision will continue to stimulate discovery, promote collaboration, and enhance communication through the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. To marshal physical and intellectual resources to support exposome-related approaches (high-resolution metabolomics, analytical chemistry, systems biology, machine learning, bioinformatics, high-throughput toxicology, and spatial and temporal statistical models) through cores, pilot funding, mentoring, and research forums. Specific Aim 2. To make major contributions towards exposome and environmental health science research. Specific Aim 3. To provide career development activities around innovative and emerging concepts and approaches related to the exposome. Specific Aim 4. To enhance and expand existing relationships with community partners to resolve environmental health issues in the community using exposome principles. Specific Aim 5. To provide infrastructure and resources to facilitate rapid translation of novel scientific findings into the development of prevention and treatment strategies in humans. Pursuit of HERCULES' aims will advance environmental health sciences within our institutions and in the scientific community.

"Developing Risk Algorithms of Internalizing Disorder Etiology and Course ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Anxiety and mood disorders (internalizing disorders [IDs]) are common and debilitating conditions. The proposed Career Development Award will provide the candidate with the necessary skills to develop an independent research program focused on identifying how psychological/personality, environmental, and biomarker vulnerabilities predict the development and course of IDs using prospective observational survey designs. The applicant's prior research training involved studying the influence of psychological/personality vulnerabilities on ID severity and course in patient samples. In order to expand his research program, the applicant is seeking advanced training in two key areas (psychiatric epidemiology; machine learning methods) and supplemental training in two additional areas (self-assessed biomarkers; environmental vulnerabilities). Collectively, this training will provide the applicant with the skills (1) to study ID onset and course using prospective survey designs, and (2) to use machine learning methods to develop clinically-useful risk algorithms of ID onset and course using multiple vulnerability domains (psychological/ personality; environmental; biomarker). These skills will be developed through a combination of didactic training, guided readings, and mentored research projects. Training will occur in the Department of Health Care Policy at Harvard Medical School under the mentoring of Dr. Ronald Kessler (an expert in psychiatric epidemiology) and Dr. Sherri Rose (an expert in machine learning). The proposed research plan involves two phases. In Phase 1, machine learning methods will be used to analyze cross-sectional ID data from the World Mental Health (WMH) Surveys in order to develop risk algorithms that predict the onset of major depression, bipolar disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder (Specific Aim 1). Machine learning methods will also be applied to WMH Survey data to develop subtypes of bipolar disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder that maximize the prediction of their long-term course (Specific Aim 2). The proposed Phase 1 studies are highly innovative; in contrast to other areas of medicine, virtually no studies have attempted to develop ID risk algorithms or subtypes using machine learning methods. However, Phase 1 studies are also preliminary; replication and expansion of the algorithms is needed in prospective samples. Accordingly, Phase 2 of the research plan (Specific Aim 3) aims to test the feasibility of conducting a large prospective web-based survey study of psychological/personality (assessed via self-report and behavior), environmental (assessed via self-report), and biomarker (assessed via self-administered salivary assays) vulnerabilities of ID onset and course. Participants will be recruited online to complete a baseline survey and those determined to have an ID or be at high-risk of developing an ID will be asked to complete bimonthly follow-ups over the course of one year. The Phase 2 study is also innovative. Despite being called ""the future"" of epidemiological research, web-based survey studies of the IDs are rare. In addition, existing prospective epidemiological studies coarsely (i.e., dichotomously) assess IDs and their vulnerabilities, and have long gaps (1-4 years) between follow-ups. The use of bimonthly online surveys of the severity of IDs and their vulnerabilities will address these limitations. Phase 2 exploratory analyses will also be conduct in which latent ID trajectories are predicted using machine learning methods. Overall, the outlined training activities and mentored research projects will be used to develop an R01 application for a prospective epidemiological study that uses machine learning methods to develop clinically useful algorithms of ID onset and course using a broad range of psychological/personality, environmental, and biomarker vulnerabilities factors. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research aims to use cutting-edge statistical methods to develop clinically-useful (1) risk algorithms to identify who is at greatest risk of developing different internalizing disorders, and (2) subtypes of internalizing disorders that identify who is most likely to experience a persistence and chronic long-term disorder course. This research has important clinical and public health implications. With this research, individuals at risk of developing internalizing disorders can be targeted using early detection and prevention efforts, while those at risk of experiencing a persistent and chronic long-term course can be targeted using tailored/intensive internalizing disorder interventions.",Developing Risk Algorithms of Internalizing Disorder Etiology and Course,9544317,K01MH106710,"['Algorithms ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Appointment ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Data Collection ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Dropout ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Future ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Surveys ', ' Literature ', ' Maintenance ', ' Medicine ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Online Systems ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Patients ', ' Personality ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Public Health ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sampling Studies ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Societies ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' PTSD ', ' Stressful Event ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Activity ', ' training module ', ' forest ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Training ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition ', ' DSM4 ', ' DSM-4 ', ' DSM-IV ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Personality Traits ', ' Individual ', ' Logistics ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Generalized Anxiety Disorder ', ' disorder onset ', ' disease onset ', ' Onset of illness ', ' Baseline Surveys ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' interest ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' experience ', ' Rare Diseases ', ' orphan disorder ', ' Rare Disorder ', ' Orphan Disease ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Prevention ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' disorder subtype ', ' disease subtype ', ' disease subgroups ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' major depression disorder ', ' major depression ', ' clinical depression ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Research Training ', ' Self-Administered ', ' Validation ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' salivary assay ', ' cost ', ' self reported behavior ', ' virtual ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' prospective ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' population based ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' follow up assessment ', ' longitudinal course ', ' Phase I Study ', ' phase 1 study ', ' phase II study ', ' phase 2 study ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' Psychiatric epidemiology ', ' secondary analysis ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIMH,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),K01,2018,164330,MA-07,-0.011902416949545363
"The HMS Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology PROJECT SUMMARY  Systems and computational biologists, physician-scientists, pharmacologists, biochemists and cell biologists will collaborate in a new Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology (LSP) to apply a measure-model approach to understanding the mechanisms of action of therapeutic drugs in multiple disease areas. The LSP will pioneer the development of quantitative network-centric approaches to pharmacology and toxicology that include analysis of dose-time-response relationships at a single-cell level, modeling of cellular network dynamics and their perturbation by drugs, development of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic models in mouse and ultimately in man and use of systematic approaches to identify and qualify new drug targets. Our approach combines mathematical modeling with empirical measurement (including work with clinical samples and data) and aims to create quantitative and predictive drug response models at different temporal and physical scales. We aim to reinvigorate pharmacology and toxicology as foundational disciplines of translational medicine, develop the conceptual underpinning for personalized and precision medicine and lower the cost of drug discovery by improving its predictability. Close interactions with industry and the FDA will help address the productivity gap in drug discovery and development. The LSP is innovative with respect to its goal of using problems in basic and translational pharmacology to link three disciplines (cell and molecular biology, computational biology and medicine) and its aim of advancing therapeutic science in the Boston area and beyond. Students and postdocs supervised by 18 faculty members, 2 independent postdoctoral fellows and two PhD-level staff from 7 institutions will work in immediate proximity in a new custom-designed laboratory. The lab will host a new graduate program in therapeutics and multi-factored outreach activities that will promote systems pharmacology internationally.  These goals will be achieved through four inter-linked research programs (Aims 1-4), a core dedicated to efficient translation of LSP research (Aim 5), an education core and administrative/outreach activities (Aims 6-8). Aim 1 will focus on the determinants of dose-response at a single-cell level, including the role of cell-to-cell variability in fractional response and of timing and order-of-exposure in combination therapy. Aim 2 will take a network-level approach to understanding therapeutic, toxic and paradoxical drug responses by kinase inhibitors in three types of cancer. The mechanistic basis and consequences of poly-pharmacology will also be examined along with differential drug responsiveness by normal and diseased tissues. Aim 3 will address PK-PD by developing multi-scale models of drug actions at the level of cells, tissues and organisms and new methods for measuring drug distribution at the cellular and subcellular levels. Aim 4 will apply machine learning and causal reasoning to target discovery from clinical records in asthma, inflammatory disease and fibrosis and pursue a structure-guided approach to identifying regulators of ""undruggable "" targets. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The computational biologists, physician-scientists and pharmacologists in the Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology will apply a combined measure-model approach to understanding the mechanisms of action of therapeutic drugs in multiple disease areas. They will develop and apply new tools to (i) investigate the factors that determine the therapeutic index of drugs at a single cell level and in tissues (ii) apply knowledge of cellulr networks to develop a rational approach to combination therapy (iii) identify and qualify new drug targets for significant unmet medical needs.

"Improving Prediction of Medical Responsiveness and Clinical Outcomes in Crohn's Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a K23 career development award resubmission for Dr. Ryan Stidham, a gastroenterologist at the University of Michigan. Dr. Stidham's long-term career goal is to develop objective prognostics to personalize treatment decisions for patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The immediate goals of the proposal are to evaluate both analytic morphomics, an image analysis platform to quantify CT scan findings, and serum glycoproteomic profiles to predict therapeutic response in patients with Crohn's disease. Dr. Stidham's integrated research and career development plan align with goals of developing himself as a collaborative translational investigator, skilled in statistical analysis o large datasets, applying novel prognostics to improve clinical outcomes in Crohn's disease. Crohn's disease (CD) affects over 700,000 patients in the United States. Nearly 60% of CD patients require surgical resection for medically-unresponsive disease within 10 years of diagnosis. Frequently, patients present with deep bowel injury composed of both medically-responsive inflammatory and non- responsive fibrotic injury. Despite the presence of an inflammatory target, medical therapy may be futile and timely surgical management should be pursued. Further, strategies using early high-intensity immunosuppression to prevent future fibrostenotic disease are likely to over treat portions of the CD population. Therefore, therapeutic decisions are predicated on (1) the probability that existing disease activity will respond to medical therapy and (2) the probability of developing future fibrostenotic complications. Assessment using colonoscopy and surrogates of inflammation including imaging, blood, and stool-based biomarkers fail to provide comprehensive and quantitative assessments of bowel injury, including fibrosis. Despite its importance, there are no measures to account for deep bowel wall injury and intestinal fibrosis. This research proposal will utilize quantitative imaging findings of deep bowel injury in conjunction with blood-based biomarkers reflecting disease phenotypes to predict medical failure, defined as requiring future bowel resection, hospitalization, and prolonged steroid use. To achieve our imaging aims (Aim 1) we will use analytic morphomics, a computer image analysis method, to quantify body and bowel composition from over 4,000 CT-enterographies in a longitudinal 1200 patient CD cohort. In Aim 2, serum glycoproteome variance will be characterized in carefully phenotyped inflammatory and stricturing subjects to refine our preexisting biomarkers of fibrosis. We have demonstrated that variations of the serum glycoproteome reflect the degree of intestinal fibrosis present and expect that serum glycoproteomics can differentiate inflammatory from fibrotic phenotypes in CD. Optimized serum glycoproteome profiles will be used to predict future conversion from B1- inflammatory disease to B2/3 fibrostenotic disease in a pediatric prospective-inception cohort (RISK study). Aim 3 entails a prospective study combining analytic morphomics and serum glycoproteome profiles to predict therapeutic response and clinical outcomes; providing preliminary data for future R03/R01 studies. Dr. Stidham is a Lecturer of Medicine at the University of Michigan Division of Gastroenterology. He earned his medical degree from the University of Virginia (AOA), completed an internal medicine residency at the University of Pennsylvania, and was a T-32 research fellow at the University of Michigan (2011). His research background combines laboratory and clinical experience with Dr. Peter Higgins (primary mentor), focusing on novel biomarker development. Dr. Stidham has been awarded several prior grants for pilot work, including a MICHR-CTSA T32 Pilot Grant for Proteomics and a Crohn's and Colitis Foundation Career Development Award for ultrasound imaging research. He is in the process of completing a Masters program in Clinical Research Design and Statistical Analysis at the University of Michigan School of Public Health (matriculation in April 2015). He has published in several gastroenterology journals, presented research internationally, and has built the independent collaborations featured in this proposal. Central to this career development award, the candidate will leverage the expertise of several mentors and collaborators to develop deep foundational skillsets in analytic imaging, translational proteomics, bioinformatics, and machine learning methods. The University of Michigan houses a nationally recognized Inflammatory Bowel Disease Program, internationally recognized proteomics expertise, and a dedicated Analytic Morphomics Group focused on computational image analysis of organs. The mentored research training will be supplemented with focused graduate-level coursework in bioinformatics, medical image analysis, machine learning methodologies, and decision support systems provided through the University of Michigan Center for Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics and the School of Public Health. The Division of Gastroenterology and Department of Medicine have a history of strong support for Dr. Stidham and will provide the time, resources, and mentorship necessary to achieve his professional and research goals. The training provided through this career development award will be pivotal for the candidate's development as an independent translational investigator focused on individualizing therapeutic management. This research will provide the foundation for future collaborative studies to further develop these and other prognostic tools for the inflammatory bowel diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed work evaluates the capabilities of quantitative image analysis and serum glycoproteome profiles to predict the probability of medical response in Crohn's disease. Improved prediction of therapeutic response would tailor Crohn's disease management such that patients unlikely to benefit from medical therapy can proceed to timely surgical management and be spared

"Role of State Medicaid Policies in Improving Access to Dental Care among Low-Income Adults PROJECT SUMMARY The purpose of this study is to examine how access to dental care among low-income adults is impacted by state Medicaid policies regarding eligibility, dental coverage, cost-sharing and dentist reimbursement. Oral health is integral to overall health, economic productivity and well-being. Yet access to dental care continues to be a major public health problem for low-income adults, leading to untreated disease, pain, poor systemic health and substantial economic burden. In recent years, several policy changes under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) such as Medicaid expansion and dependent care coverage could significantly impact access to dental care among the poor non-elderly adults. In addition, there is extensive cross-state variation in terms of dental benefits covered for Medicaid adults. These variations provide natural experiments to examine the effect of Medicaid policies on access to dental care. Moreover, under the current health reform discussions, state Medicaid programs are anticipated to gain autonomy in resource allocation, yet may receive significantly less federal funding, making the need for robust evidence on relative effectiveness of Medicaid policy alternatives available to the states paramount. The overarching goal of this application is to advance the research career of the candidate (Dr. Singhal) by protecting her time for training and research on these critical issues in oral health policy. This goal will be accomplished through additional training in complementary disciplines of econometrics and machine learning, and their application to estimate the impacts of Medicaid coverage and payment generosities on access to dental care. The project brings together complementary secondary data from multiple sources including: large national survey data (National Health Interview Survey), administrative enrollment and claims data (Medicaid Analytic eXtract) and linked survey and claims data. Leveraging these data and training resources, this project will: 1) develop synthetic indices of Medicaid dental coverage and payment generosities; 2) estimate the effect of each policy alternative and combined generosity indices on various measures of access to dental care; and 3) predict the relative effectiveness of policy alternatives and their combinations on access to dental care. We will use econometric methods including instrumental variables, difference-in-difference and regression discontinuity models to develop the generosity indices and to estimate the impact of Medicaid generosity. To develop and validate the predictive model, we will use supervised machine learning approaches (e.g. decision tree learning) using linked survey and claims data. The results will provide evidence needed to inform future strategies to ensure efficient use of health care resources to reduce oral health disparities. The completion of this project will also enable Dr. Singhal to establish a research program as an independent research investigator with support from her multi-disciplinary mentoring and advising teams and the vibrant research community at Boston University. PROJECT NARRATIVE Access to dental care is a major public health problem among low-income adults, as evidenced by declining rates of dental care utilization, high unmet dental need, and the increasing rate of emergency department visits for dental problems by this vulnerable population. The research plan of this career development award aims to: 1) examine how state Medicaid policies regarding eligibility, coverage and dentist reimbursement impact access to dental care among low-income adults, and 2) develop a model to predict the impact of hypothetical policy changes. A clearer understanding of the relative effectiveness of policy alternatives available to states is critical to ensuring the efficient use of healthcare resources and achieving NIDCR’s strategic goal to reduce income-based disparities in access to and outcomes of oral health care services.",Role of State Medicaid Policies in Improving Access to Dental Care among Low-Income Adults,9504868,K08DE027720,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Boston ', ' Communities ', ' Cost Control ', ' Cost Containment ', ' Decision Trees ', ' Dental Care ', ' dental service ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' Dental Health Services ', ' Dentists ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Economics ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Environment ', ' Expenditure ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Services ', ' Health Services Research ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' indexing ', ' Learning ', ' Low Income Population ', ' Medicaid ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' pressure ', ' Production ', ' Productivity ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Policy ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Supervision ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Measures ', ' Cost Sharing ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Resource Allocation ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' career ', ' population survey ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' Healthcare Reform ', ' Health Reform ', ' Health Care Reform ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Dental ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' Policies ', ' Development Plans ', ' Funding ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Structure ', ' payment ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Economic Burden ', ' Improve Access ', ' National Health Interview Survey ', ' National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research ', ' National Institute of Dental Research ', ' NIDR ', ' NIDCR ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' cost ', ' health economics ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Natural experiment ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' evidence base ', ' population health ', ' BigData ', ' Big Data ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' Obamacare ', ' Affordable Care Act ', ' healthcare service ', ' health care service ', ' relative effectiveness ', ' ']",NIDCR,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,K08,2018,131517,MA-07,0.002198622639929274
"Measuring, Modeling and Controlling Heterogeneity ABSTRACT - Overall The overall goal of the Measuring, Modeling and Controlling Heterogeneity Center in the Cancer Systems Biol- ogy Consortium (M2CH-CSBC Center) is to improve management of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) by developing systems level strategies to prevent the emergence of cancer subpopulations that are resistant to treatment. We postulate that heterogeneity arising from epigenomic instability intrinsic to cancer cells and di- verse signals from extrinsic microenvironments in which cancer cells reside are root causes of resistance. We will learn how intrinsic and extrinsic factors influence differentiation state, proliferation and therapeutic re- sponse in TNBC through experimental manipulation and computational modeling of cancer cell lines, 3D engi- neered multicellular systems, xenografts and clinical specimens. We will deploy single cell `omic and imaging technologies that allow quantitative assessment of molecular, cellular, and structural heterogeneity. We will interpret these data using computational models that define control networks and structures in heterogeneous systems as well as transitions between states of therapeutic resistance and sensitivity. This will be accom- plished in three related Projects and three Cores. Project 1 will focus on measuring and managing resistance- associated heterogeneity intrinsic to cancer cells. Project 2 will focus on identifying resistance-associated sig- nals from the microenvironment and on mitigating effects from these signals on therapeutic response. Project 3 will apply spatial systems biology approaches to TNBC specimens and multicell type models thereof to dis- cover molecular control networks that influence how cell intrinsic plasticity and microenvironment signaling al- ter therapeutic responses in complex tissues. All three Projects will include analysis of 5 core cell lines (HCC1143, HCC1599, MDA-MB-468, SUM149PT, and HCC1806), 5 patient derived cultures, and 6 FDA ap- proved, pathway-targeted drugs (afatinib, ruxolotinib, trametinib, BYL719, cabozantinib, and everolimus). The computational network discovery, data integration, spatial systems analysis and modeling approaches are the same in all Projects and serve to integrate the work of the overall M2CH-CSBC Center. Multiple integrative computational strategies are proposed to identify candidate heterogeneity control networks. These include analysis of existing genomic, epigenomic, pharmacologic response, and metabolomic characteristics of prima- ry tumors and models thereof. An Imaging Management and Analysis Core will provide infrastructure and image analytics that will enable efficient image data management, quantitative analysis of image features, and visualization of images and metadata generated using multiscale light and electron microscopy. An Outreach Core will make educational materials, experimental and computational tools and data available to the CSB Consortium, to the CSBC/PS-ON Coordinating Center and to the broader scientific community. An Administrative Core serves as the organization, integration, and evaluation hub of the M2CH-CSBC Center.

"Psoriasis Center of Research Translation The Psoriasis Center of Research Translation at Case Western Reserve University (CORT) will advance translational discovery and application in psoriasis using a cutting-edge systems biology approach that integrates patient-centered data within a rich and synergistic /collaborative institutional environment. We will leverage extensive preclinical, clinical and translational resources with the expertise and experience of our CWRU interdisciplinary research team, which encompasses bioinformatics, micro/myocobiome, psoriasis patient care, cutaneous immunology and transgenic models.  The overall goal of the CORT is to combine new bioinformatic methodologies with advanced murine and human experimental approaches to translate scientific findings into clinical applications that more nimbly advance therapy for psoriasis and related inflammatory comorbidities. Our highly innovative, synergistic and cross-disciplinary CORT model will use a collaborative research project (CRP) as a central hub with bi- directional input from 2 highly interactive research cores, to refine and test hypotheses, identify and test drug leads and advance understanding of psoriasis and related inflammatory comorbidities. To do so, the CRP will integrate input from the: 1) Preclinical Modeling Core (PMC), that will provide and customize our many validated, unique transgenic psoriasiform animal models and translatable human xenograft approaches, essential to translating new mediator/pathway roles and drug leads; 2) Applied Meta-`Omics Core (AMC), that will apply multi-platform (transcriptome, metabolome, micro/mycobiome) bioinformatics to individual patient and murine samples to identify novel pathway-specific targets. Iterative experimental testing of these targets and feedback from the PMC and CRP will identify key novel pathways critical for psoriasis pathogenesis likely to benefit from intervention by new drugs or repurposed existing drugs for psoriasis therapy.  Our patient-centered translational approach will exploit and enhance a novel, comprehensive and highly annotated database of ~850 psoriasis/psoriatic arthritis single-patient case records that combines clinical information derived from CLEARPATH (an Ohio medical provider consortium-based unified EMR repository for research access), with inflammation markers that stratify subsets. Into each patient's EMR, we will directly integrate his/her meta'Omics data created by the AMC working with the CRP, to create an 'Omics-integrated EMR (EMRi) data set. These cohesive multi-platform personal data records will identify psoriasis patient endotypes based upon unique perturbations identified from their “meta'Omics” analyses. Our overarching hypothesis is that by powerfully combining existing and developing psoriasis basic science datasets, patient records, bioinformatics and computational systems biology with bi-directional mouse and human studies, we will identify new therapeutic targets and repurposed drugs that can be expeditiously moved to clinical trials, improving psoriasis treatment and patient care. The Psoriasis CORT at Case Western Reserve University and University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center uses emerging capabilities of data analyses that can assemble many aspects of a single psoriasis patient in great detail, including their gene expression in skin and blood cells, the skin microbes (both bacterial and fungal) and the clinical features that are recorded in their electronic medical record (EMR). Using advanced computer algorithms to compare in-house patient data against externally available large databases, we can identify drugs already approved by the FDA that may be repurposed to treat psoriasis, and validate/invalidate them in animal models and patient cells.",Psoriasis Center of Research Translation,9568310,P50AR070590,"['Psoriatic Arthritis ', ' Psoriasis Arthropathica ', '

"In situ transcriptome profiling in single cells Summary We have recently developed intron seqFISH (sequential Fluorescence in situ hybridization) to multiplex 10,421 genes directly in single cells. We showed that the 10,421 gene nascent transcriptome profile can identify cell types as well as capture the trajectory of the cells. We further demonstrated that we can perform mRNA seqFISH as well as immunostaining in the same cells following the 10,421 gene intron seqFISH measurement. We propose to develop this technology as a potential alternative approach to single cell RNAseq for the HuBMAP to characterize cell types directly in situ in tissues. In particular, we will adept in situ amplification methods such as hybridization chain reaction (HCR) to intron seqFISH. We had previously shown that mRNA seqFISH with HCR amplification performs exceptionally in tissues in overcoming autofluorescence background and enable robust decoding seqFISH barcodes. We will validate the integrated intron and mRNA seqFISH protocol in the mouse hippocampus in the UG3 phase of the project. Also in UG3 phase, we will develop computational tools to integrate intron seqFISH data with mRNA seqFISH as well as single cell RNAseq data. In the UH3 phase, we will translate the technology to human tissues, with a focus on human mammary tissues provided by Dr. Seewaldt at City of Hope. We will also work with the tissue mapping centers in the HuBMAP program to accelerate the translation of this technology to many tissue types. In the UH3 phase, we will generate million cell spatial atlas of human tissues containing intron profiles, mRNA profiles and protein abundances in each single cell. We will further develop computational tools to analyze for spatial enrichment of genes in the tissue and generate a pseudotime of developmental trajectories using the nascent transcriptome data. Taken together, we will develop a high throughput in situ imaging based platform to characterize cell types and future trajectories of cells using intron and mRNA seqFISH technologies. Narrative Transcriptome profiling in situ at the single cell level has transformative potential for understanding healthy versus diseased tissues in the human body. We propose an integrative approach profiling the nascent transcriptome as well as hundreds of mature transcripts in single cells in tissues. We will generate million cell spatial atlas for the mouse hippocampus as well as the human mammary tissue. We will gain unprecedented insight into the developmental of neurons in the brain as well as the duct cells in the breast.

"Integration and Visualization of Diverse Biological Data ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The onset of most human disease involves multiple, molecular-level changes to the complex system of interacting genes and pathways that function differently in specific cell-lineage, pathway and treatment contexts. While this system has been probed by the thousands of functional genomics and quantitative genetic studies, careful extraction of signals relevant to these specific contexts is a challenging problem. General integration of these heterogeneous data was an important first step in detecting signals that be used to build networks to generate experimentally-testable hypotheses. However, only by dealing with the fact that disease happens at the intersection of multiple contexts and by integrating functional genomics with quantitative genetics will we be able to move toward a molecular-level understanding of human pathophysiology, which will pave the way to new therapy and drug development.  The long-term goal of this project is to enable such discoveries through the development of innovative bioinformatics frameworks for integrative analysis of diverse functional genomic data. In the previous funding periods, we developed accurate data integration and visualization methodologies for most common model organisms and human, created methods for tissue-specific data analysis, and applied these methods to make novel insights about important biological processes. We further enabled experimental biological discovery by implementing these methods in publicly accessible interactive systems that are popular with experimental biologists.  Leveraging our prior work, we now will directly address the challenge of enabling data-driven study of molecular mechanisms underlying human disease by developing novel semi-supervised and multi-task machine learning approaches and implementing them in a real-time integration system capable of predicting genome-scale functional and mechanism-specific networks focused on any biological context of interest. This will allow any biomedical researcher to quickly make data-driven hypotheses about function, interactions, and regulation of genes involved in hypertension in the kidney glomerulus or to predict new regulatory interactions relevant to Parkinson's disease that affect the ubiquitination pathway in Substantia nigra. Furthermore, we will develop methods for disease gene discovery that leverage these highly specific networks for functional analysis of quantitative genetics data. Our deliverable will be a general, robust, user-friendly, and automatically updated system for user-driven functional genomic data integration and functional analysis of quantitative genetics data. Throughout this work, we (with our close experimental and clinical collaborators) will also apply our methods to chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease/hypertension, and autism spectrum disorders both as case studies for the iterative improvement of our methods and to make direct contribution to better understanding of these diseases.

"Functional and transcriptional analysis of embryonic hematopoietic stem cell development at the single cell level PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The therapeutic potential of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) could be significantly enhanced by methods to generate HSC de novo from pluripotent stem cells (PSC) or reprogrammed adult cells. Thus, there has been great interest in understanding the embryologic origin of HSC and the signal pathways that guide HSC development and self-renewal, such that the process of HSC genesis can be recapitulated in vitro, a goal which has yet to be realized. Given the heterogeneity and developmental asynchrony in hemogenic precursors during their emergence in the embryo, to achieve this it will be necessary to develop better strategies to isolate and characterize the rare precursors capable of giving rise to HSC and to understand the signals that drive their development to functional, engrafting HSC. To this end, I have established that endothelial cells (EC) derived from the aorta-gonad-mesonephros region (AGM), the niche in which the first HSC emerge, can promote the in vitro specification and self-renewal of engrafting HSC from hemogenic precursors, including recent studies at the single cell level. Furthermore, I have shown that the Notch pathway functions in both specification and self-renewal of HSC in the EC niche, and that use of immobilized Notch ligands to activate the Notch pathway, along with hematopoietic cytokines, is sufficient to induce expansion of embryonic HSC. Building upon this work, the goals of this proposal are to utilize this novel in vitro AGM-EC system to elucidate the phenotypic, molecular, and functional properties of HSC precursors as they transition to functional HSC capable of long-term, multilineage engraftment. This will require isolation and functional characterization of HSC precursors across different stages of their development at the single cell level (Aim 1), followed by single cell transcriptional analysis to determine the gene regulatory networks and molecular signals promoting their development to functional HSC (Aim 2A). In studies working toward the engineering of stromal cell-free systems for HSC generation, agonists of identified signaling pathways will be functionally tested for their capacity to support HSC development in conjunction with the known requirement for Notch signaling activation (Aim 2B). Altogether, these studies will provide novel insight into the unique properties of HSC precursors, as well at the signaling mechanisms governing their maturation to functional HSC, which will have important implications in advancing our ability to generate HSC from PSC. To accomplish these aims, I will leverage the wealth of resources available in the mentoring laboratory of Dr. Bernstein, as well as key resources available at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, the University of Washington, and Seattle Children’s Hospital, and opportunities for co-mentorship from Dr. Shahin Rafii at the Ansary Stem Cell Institute at Weill Cornell Medical College. A key aspect of my career development plan is to also acquire new skills that will facilitate my research objectives, including techniques in single cell RNA-seq and bioinformatics analysis which will be performed in collaboration with and under the co-mentorship of Dr. Cole Trapnell in Genome Sciences at the University of Washington. This type of interdisciplinary training will provide me with the tools necessary to apply innovative technologies in unravelling the complexity of niche- stem cell interactions that instruct HSC fates. My research experience studying hematopoietic stem cell development has provided me with a strong background to facilitate success in the proposed research goals. My clinical experience in caring for children undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has cemented a strong passion to expand scientific knowledge of HSC and translate this knowledge to improve therapies for children with hematologic, immunologic, and oncologic diseases. Success in my research and career development goals outlined in this proposal will enable me to establish an independent academic career as a physician-scientist with the skills to lead a diverse research team and collaborate broadly to address essential questions in stem cell biology. Ultimately, my long-term goal is to develop a laboratory-based career with focus on taking fundamental principles discovered through basic research in developmental HSC biology toward clinical applications in hematopoietic stem cell therapeutics.

"Neuroimaging Analysis Center (NAC) Project Summary/Abstract The ability to access huge cohorts of patient medical records and radiology data, the emergence of ever-more detailed imaging modalities, and the availability of unprecedented computer processing power marks the pos- sibility for a new era in neuroimaging, disease understanding, and patient treatment. To unlock the full medical potential made possible by these new technologies, new algorithms and clinically-relevant techniques must be developed by close collaboration between computer scientists, physicians, and medical researchers. We are excited to propose a national resource center with the goal of finding new ways of extracting disease characteristics from advanced imaging and computation, and to make these methods available to the larger medical community through a proven methodology of world-class research, open-source software, and exten- sive collaboration. The overarching theme for this P41 renewal is the discovery and analysis of novel imaging phenotypes to characterize disease. We use the term imaging phenotypes to describe patterns or features of disease that can be detected through imaging (predominantly MRI) followed by machine learning, statistical analysis, feature detection, and correlation with other indicators of disease such as structured patient infor- mation. The three proposed Technology Research & Development (TR&D) projects address this common question us- ing a variety of complementary approaches and clinical testbeds. TR&D 1 addresses microstructure of tissue, including novel imaging methods to detect tumor microstructure. TR&D 2 investigates rich spatial patterns of disease extracted from clinical imaging with a focus on cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative conditions such as stroke. Finally, TR&D 3 proposes novel image and connectivity-based features that can be correlated with a variety of diseases, with a clinical emphasis on pediatric brain development. Technical innovation will be driven by intense collaboration between the TR&Ds and key collaborators in neurosurgery, neurology, and pe- diatrics. The TR&Ds will leverage recent important developments in the fields of image acquisition, machine learning, and data science to identify and exploit novel imaging phenotypes of disease. Building on our long history of developing clinically-relevant methods, each TR&D includes a translational and clinical validation aim to ensure our work is clinically relevant and effective at meeting the driving clinical goals. NAC's proven software engi- neering, translation, and dissemination infrastructure, along with its established network of academic, medical, and industrial partners, enhance the center's value as a national resource.

"HERCULES: Exposome Research Center PROJECT SUMMARY: HERCULES The vision of the HERCULES P30 is to demonstrably advance the role of environmental health sciences in clinical and public health settings using the platform of the exposome. Healthcare and biomedical research have become increasingly genome-centric. While much of this is due to the impressive achievements in genomics, which have consistently outpaced gains in environmental health, it is our contention that a more persuasive case needs to be made for environmental factors. Science and intuition support the idea that the environment plays just as large of a role as genetics for the majority of diseases. The exposome, which embraces a strategy and scale similar to genomic research, is poised to elevate the environment in discussions of health and disease. We will continue to grow and enhance the environmental health science research portfolio at Emory through cutting-edge technologies and innovative data solutions. We will build upon the superb relationships we have built with the local community and continue to push the mission of NIEHS on campus and across the scientific landscape. Based on the extraordinary progress over our first three years, we propose to retain our theme to use exposome-related concepts and approaches to improve human health. This simple and unifying vision will continue to stimulate discovery, promote collaboration, and enhance communication through the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. To marshal physical and intellectual resources to support exposome-related approaches (high-resolution metabolomics, analytical chemistry, systems biology, machine learning, bioinformatics, high-throughput toxicology, and spatial and temporal statistical models) through cores, pilot funding, mentoring, and research forums. Specific Aim 2. To make major contributions towards exposome and environmental health science research. Specific Aim 3. To provide career development activities around innovative and emerging concepts and approaches related to the exposome. Specific Aim 4. To enhance and expand existing relationships with community partners to resolve environmental health issues in the community using exposome principles. Specific Aim 5. To provide infrastructure and resources to facilitate rapid translation of novel scientific findings into the development of prevention and treatment strategies in humans. Pursuit of HERCULES' aims will advance environmental health sciences within our institutions and in the scientific community.

"Comprehensive but simple encoding of bioassays to accelerate translational drug discovery PROJECT SUMMARY Collaborative Drug Discovery, Inc. (CDD) proposes to extend its innovative software platform — BioAssay Express (BAE, version 1.0) — which helps biologists to quickly and easily encode their plain-text biological assay protocols into formats suitable for computational processing. In Phase 2B, CDD will further enhance BAE so that it can markup a bioassay with a comprehensive, detailed set of annotations that completely specifies the protocol, step by step. In its current state of development in Phase 2, BAE 1.0 enables scientists to summarize the English language text that specifies an experimental protocol, supplementing it with machine-interpretable descriptors. At the end of Phase 2B, BAE 2.0 will output a detailed machine- interpretable version that will be completely equivalent to, and can optionally substitute for, the traditional English language method description. The enhanced BAE 2.0 software will enable scientists engaged in early stage drug discovery to efficiently and accurately document experimental procedures and intelligently aggregate datasets across research groups. An important benefit will be facilitating improved access, use and reproducibility by (1) flagging differences between closely related assays; (2) correlating differences in protocols with differences in results; and (3) improving the reproducibility of experiments conducted in different laboratories, to highlight potential causes of divergences. The project will continue to leverage the related broad initiatives at NIH and elsewhere that are working to promote translational research, gather screening data via open repositories, and apply sophisticated ontologies to classify these datasets. Our project targets the intersection of these disparate initiatives and unifies them by making their complex standards and guidelines for praxis realistically accessible to researchers who want to focus on their scientific work To encourage adoption, the software will prioritize intuitive ease of use by scientists who are not informatics experts, harmonize with existing laboratory workflows, minimize the extra effort of annotation, integrate seamlessly into preclinical data management platforms (including but not limited to CDD’s own CDD Vault), and deliver clear and immediate benefits to the user as part of an integrated experience. This combination of new capabilities and extreme ease of use will accelerate translational drug discovery efforts by empowering software platforms that bridge the divide between biologists and medicinal chemists to apply sophisticated tools — long available on the chemistry side — for the first time also to the biological side, and thus across both domains. Existing software can already easily connect screening results to chemical structures. This new platform will further connect these data to the purpose and methodology of the screens. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will create novel computational tools that will help researchers to efficiently and accurately document experimental procedures, thereby facilitating improved access, use and reproducibility of data and assays. This fundamental capability ultimately accelerates translating new experimental discoveries into the development of novel and improved drugs against a wide range of diseases. These tools will particularly benefit networks of researchers working on diseases that leading pharmaceutical companies have largely ignored because they are not perceived as highly profitable opportunities, despite the fact that in many cases they afflict millions of people.",Comprehensive but simple encoding of bioassays to accelerate translational drug discovery,9464228,R44TR000185,"['Adoption ', ' Algorithms ', ' Awareness ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Chemistry ', ' Communities ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Government ', ' Incentives ', ' Industry ', ' Institutes ', ' Laboratories ', ' Manuals ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Robotics ', ' Semantics ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Standardization ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Texas ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Guidelines ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Ensure ', ' Chemical Structure ', ' Training ', ' Intuition ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' Policies ', ' Data Quality ', ' Collaborations ', ' Descriptor ', ' Letters ', ' tool ', ' scaffold ', ' scaffolding ', ' English Language ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Side ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' System ', ' empowered ', ' data management ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' repository ', ' drug discovery ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Academia ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Retrieval ', ' Ontology ', ' Screening Result ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research ', ' Text ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Output ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' PubChem ', ' Instruction ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' prospective ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' biomedical ontology ', ' screening ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' ']",NCATS,"COLLABORATIVE DRUG DISCOVERY, INC.",R44,2018,744321,CA-14,-0.022238811559540776
"C-PAC: A configurable, compute-optimized, cloud-enabled neuroimaging analysis software for reproducible translational and comparative ABSTRACT The BRAIN Initiative is designed to leverage sophisticated neuromodulation, electrophysiological recording, and macroscale neuroimaging techniques in human and non-human animal models in order to develop a multilevel understanding of human brain function. However, the necessary tools for organizing, processing and analyzing neuroimaging data generated through these efforts are not widely available as coherent and easy-to- use software packages. Gaps are particularly apparent for nonhuman data (i.e., monkey, rodent), as most of the existing processing and analytic software packages are specifically designed for human imaging. Methods have been proposed for addressing the challenges inherent to the processing of nonhuman data (e.g., brain extraction, tissue segmentation, spatial normalization, brain parcellation, temporal denoising); to date, these have not been readily integrated into an easy-to-use, robust, and reproducible analysis package. Similarly, many of the sophisticated machine learning and modeling methods developed for neuroimaging analyses are inaccessible to most researchers because they have not been integrated into easy-to-use pipeline software. As a result, translational and comparative neuroimaging researchers patch together neuroinformatics pipelines that use various combinations of disparate software packages and in-house code. We propose to extend the Configurable Pipeline for the Analysis of Connectomes (C-PAC) open-source software to provide robust and reproducible pipelines for functional and structural MRI data. We will integrate the various disparate image processing and analysis methods used to handle the challenges of nonhuman imaging data, into a single, open source, configurable, easy-to-use end-to-end analysis pipeline package that is accessible locally or via the cloud. The end product will not only improve the quality, transparency and reproducibility of nonhuman translational and comparative imaging, but also enable new avenues of scientific inquiry through our inclusion of methods that are yet to be applied to nonhuman imaging data (e.g., gradient- based cortical parcellation methods, hyperalignment). Specific aims of the proposed work include to: 1) Integrate neuroimaging processing and analysis methods optimized for BRAIN Initiative data, 2) Implement strategies for carrying out comparative studies of human and non-human populations, and 3) Extend C-PAC to include cutting-edge analytical strategies for identifying mechanisms of brain function. All development will occur “in the open” using GitHub and other collaborative tools to maximally involve participation in the C-PAC project. Annual hackathons will be held to collaborate with investigators from BRAIN Initiative awards and other neuroinformatics development projects to integrate their tools with C-PAC. Hands-on training will be held to train investigators on optimal use of the newly developed tools. NARRATIVE New neuroimaging analysis software is needed to process and analyze the various human and non-human neuroimaging data collected through the BRAIN Initiative. We will address this need by extending the already mature C-PAC human brain imaging data analysis pipeline to include support for animal data, with a particular focus on providing methods for conducting comparative studies between species.

"Integrative Biology Approach to Identify and Characterize Roles of lncRNAs Associated with Psoriasis Pathology PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Candidate After the completion of my Ph.D. in Bioinformatics, I joined the Center for Statistical Genetics at the University of Michigan (U-M) as research fellow and acquired extensive training in analysis on high- dimensional biological data. I uncovered a strong interest in studying the genetics and genomics of psoriasis when working with Dr. James Elder at the U-M, and I developed a fascination in understanding the functional roles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in cutaneous diseases. I joined the Department of Dermatology at the U-M as a faculty in summer of 2015, with secondary appointments in the Department of Computational Medicine & Bioinformatics and the Department of Biostatistics. In addition, I direct the new Center for Cutaneous Bioinformatics within the Department of Dermatology, and serve to supervise and implement an analysis pipeline for studies investigating the immunological mechanisms for different skin diseases. Career Development Plan I aim to become a future leader in combining in silico discovery and bench experiments to advance biomedical research in autoimmune skin disorders. My objective in seeking a Mentored Research Scientist Development Award is to acquire the additional knowledge, training, and experience necessary for me to become an independent scholar in developing novel systems biology approaches to decipher the pathology and mechanisms of cutaneous diseases. The five year training proposed will provide knowledge and experience in aspects that are critical to my success, and they are: i) To develop knowledge and experimental skills in cutaneous biology --- achieved by guidance from Dr. Elder (investigative dermatology), intense research meetings/conferences, and practical laboratory experience in cutaneous research; ii) To develop knowledge and skills to study immunological systems of autoimmune skin diseases --- achieved by supervision from Dr. Johann Gudjonsson (skin immunology), attending formal Immunology courses and seminars, and earning laboratory experience from immunology experiments; iii) To advance skills in developing statistical and computational approaches --- accomplished by mentoring from Dr. Goncalo Abecasis (computational biologist), research meetings, and conducting research projects requiring advanced skills and knowledge in quantitative science; iv) To cultivate my professional development through enhancing scientific connections, grantsmanship skills, and educator portfolio --- achieved by establishing connections with colleagues during meetings, visiting King’s College London as scholar, attending a grantsmanship workshop and bootcamp, and learning mentoring skills through teaching formal classes and mentoring research students. Through the intensive and comprehensive training, I will be well grounded in conducting basic science experiments and also be able to capitalize my advanced knowledge in quantitative science to model mechanisms in cutaneous diseases. Research Project The research project will use psoriasis as a disease model to study the roles of lncRNAs in complex cutaneous disorders. I will test the hypotheses that (i): some lncRNAs are key causal elements and potentiate pathogenic inflammatory reactions in psoriasis development and (ii) by combining in silico predictions and in vitro validations we are able to provide comprehensive characterization of skin-expressing lncRNAs in keratinocytes and lymphocytes to infer their pathological implications for psoriasis. This work will demonstrate how we can take advantages of the genomic data to develop an integrative biology framework to provide novel biological insights and understand pathological roles of lncRNAs. Significance Psoriasis is a chronic immune-mediated skin disease with complex genetic architecture. It is estimated that over 4 million Americans and 100 million people worldwide suffer from this disease. While genetic association studies have revealed the disease loci are highly enriched in non-coding regions, it is very challenging to translate genetic signals to biologic effects. In fact, most of the causal genes have not yet been identified. Our preliminary results showed that lncRNA is a class of gene that has largely been understudied for their roles in psoriasis, and both genetic and transcriptomic data suggested they can play important functions in psoriasis pathogenesis. By combining in silico analysis and in vitro validation we can expand our knowledge of lncRNAs in skin biology, and generate important hypotheses for future experiments. The results of this project can also identify novel biomarkers, and ultimately assist in the therapeutic drug discovery.

"2018 OSA Optics and the Brain Conference FOA: PA-16-294 Opportunity Title: NIH Support for Conferences and Scientific Meetings (R13/U13) Agency: NIH - NINDS Proposal Title: 2018 OSA Optics and the Brain Conference Principal Investigator: Gregory J. Quarles, Ph.D., Chief Scientist, The Optical Society  2010 Massachusetts Ave, NW, Washington, DC  gquarles@osa.org, 202-416-1954 Project Summary /Abstract:  The 2018 OSA Biophotonics Congress: Biomedical Optics, 3-6 April 2018, Hollywood, FL, consists of four topical meetings. Within this congress, the Optics and the Brain Conference is specifically focused on cutting-edge research and innovative new tools and techniques that seek to increase fundamental knowledge about the brain and nervous system. This proposal is to provide registration and travel support for students, early career professionals, and underrepresented speakers that will present on optics and the brain topics within this meeting.  The 2018 OSA Optics and the Brain conference was founded in 2015 in response to the USA BRAIN Initiative and the European Human Brain Project. These initiatives have identified the urgent need for new technologies that can probe the working brain across all levels from single neurons to entire behaving organisms. Optics offers a unique toolkit for multiscale imaging the living and intact brain, while new genetic labeling strategies provide optical contrast to neural function and optogenetics permits the control of cellular function with light. Optics and the Brain is thus an important, highly interdisciplinary area of research that combines broad aspects of neuroscience, biology, medicine, physics, chemistry and engineering. This year the program is adding more topics to be able to better explore new tools, the use of artificial intelligence in machine learning and technologies that will allow doctors to explore larger, deeper sections of the brain.  The general purpose of this congress with co-located meetings is to create an inclusive, open forum for the presentation of high-quality scientific research through plenary and technical sessions, short courses, panels, networking and special events. This method of face-to-face information sharing allows researchers to learn what others in their field and related disciplines are doing and to efficiently learn about new research, tools, and techniques that might be relevant to their work. It allows conversations with colleagues from different institutions around the world and engenders far reaching scientific collaborations – both domestic and international. In addition, this meeting provides an opportunity for students and early career professionals to present their work, participate in professional development activities, and to hear from and network with internationally-renowned invited speakers who represent the broad diversity of optics and the brain related research. Ultimately this meeting, where best-in-class research is presented and discussed will advance knowledge in the field of biomedical optics and biophotonics and propel technological development forward.

"Neuroimaging Analysis Center (NAC) Project Summary/Abstract The ability to access huge cohorts of patient medical records and radiology data, the emergence of ever-more detailed imaging modalities, and the availability of unprecedented computer processing power marks the pos- sibility for a new era in neuroimaging, disease understanding, and patient treatment. To unlock the full medical potential made possible by these new technologies, new algorithms and clinically-relevant techniques must be developed by close collaboration between computer scientists, physicians, and medical researchers. We are excited to propose a national resource center with the goal of finding new ways of extracting disease characteristics from advanced imaging and computation, and to make these methods available to the larger medical community through a proven methodology of world-class research, open-source software, and exten- sive collaboration. The overarching theme for this P41 renewal is the discovery and analysis of novel imaging phenotypes to characterize disease. We use the term imaging phenotypes to describe patterns or features of disease that can be detected through imaging (predominantly MRI) followed by machine learning, statistical analysis, feature detection, and correlation with other indicators of disease such as structured patient infor- mation. The three proposed Technology Research & Development (TR&D) projects address this common question us- ing a variety of complementary approaches and clinical testbeds. TR&D 1 addresses microstructure of tissue, including novel imaging methods to detect tumor microstructure. TR&D 2 investigates rich spatial patterns of disease extracted from clinical imaging with a focus on cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative conditions such as stroke. Finally, TR&D 3 proposes novel image and connectivity-based features that can be correlated with a variety of diseases, with a clinical emphasis on pediatric brain development. Technical innovation will be driven by intense collaboration between the TR&Ds and key collaborators in neurosurgery, neurology, and pe- diatrics. The TR&Ds will leverage recent important developments in the fields of image acquisition, machine learning, and data science to identify and exploit novel imaging phenotypes of disease. Building on our long history of developing clinically-relevant methods, each TR&D includes a translational and clinical validation aim to ensure our work is clinically relevant and effective at meeting the driving clinical goals. NAC's proven software engi- neering, translation, and dissemination infrastructure, along with its established network of academic, medical, and industrial partners, enhance the center's value as a national resource.

"Microdata for Analysis of Early Life Conditions, Health, and Population Project Summary This project will enhance and develop the only source of data that provides core information about work, education, income, and migration for the entire U.S. population. This unique resource allows us to observe today's late-life population when they were young. This allows a prospective view of the impact of early-life environments and socioeconomic status on health and well-being in later life. The massive database describes the characteristics of all 133 million persons who resided in the United States in 1940. The data have been available for only a brief period, but are already having a profound impact on scientific research. They are the primary data source for at least 19 sponsored projects, including nine funded by NIH and seven funded by NSF. Through May 2017, 104 investigators had produced 95 papers based on the data, including 22 articles, four books, three PhD dissertations, and 66 working papers. This project will improve the quality and usability of the database by correcting transcription errors; improving the coding, editing, and allocation of key variables; and introducing new data dissemination tools designed to simplify access to the data. The project will undertake three major activities to meet these objectives. 1. Incorporate new verified census information on name, age, sex, family relationship, race, marital status,  birthplace, and residence five years ago. 2. Improve coding, editing, and allocation for geographic variables, migration, occupation, and numerically-  coded variables such as income. 3. Apply new technologies to democratize access to the data through new data access tools and a virtual data  enclave for a restricted version of the data that contains names. This project is a highly cost-effective use of scarce resources to develop shared infrastructure for research, education, and policy-making on health and aging.

"Precision Medicine by Targeting Cell Adhesion in Melanoma PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In the proposed research, we address a problem that is common not just to melanoma, but also to other forms of cancer, such as prostate cancer, and that has been widely discussed recently. While we as dermatologists encourage patients to undergo skin cancer screening exams to detect melanoma early, it remains challenging to differentiate the truly aggressive from the indolent or nonclinical pigmented lesions. This is true even after a melanoma has been biopsied and examined under the microscope. As a result, there is massive over-diagnosis and overtreatment, specifically with respect to sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsies, that is costly, has side effects, requires precious hospital infrastructure and induces substantial patient anxiety. Surprisingly, and despite decades of research on cancer, assessment of metastasis risk in primary cutaneous melanoma continues to be based primarily on tumor invasion depth (also referred to Breslow depth), a method that was introduced 45 years go. While Breslow depth tends to work well at the extreme ends of the spectrum, most melanomas fall into a grey zone where Breslow depth with or without additional tissue-derived and clinical variables (such as patient age) does not predict the true biology of melanoma well. Breslow depth continues to be popular because alternative methods, including molecular-based methods, are either ineffective, have not been appropriately validated or lack a strong biological rationale. This in turn inhibits the development of new and innovative therapies. Here we will study a method that quantifies changes in integrin-linked cell adhesion to better differentiate high-risk (defined as SLN positive melanoma) from biologically indolent melanoma. First, we will study consecutive cases of cutaneous melanoma from across the United States and Europe and correlate a molecular profile of cell adhesion with SLN status. Second, we will study how the inhibition of certain aspects of integrin adhesion affects melanoma growth and metastasis in vivo. We expect that our research will validate methods to identify high-risk melanoma that outperform the standard of care, reduce the rate of unnecessary SLN procedures and identify patients with high-risk melanoma overlooked by current procedures. Moreover, a better understanding of the molecular machinery that drives metastasis will create new therapeutic opportunities. The candidate’s long term goal is discover novel characteristics of malignant melanocytes that enable the development of new and innovative diagnostic methods and therapies. The mentored career development award will help the candidate acquire new methodological, professional and leadership skills to independently, successfully and meaningfully contribute to the fields of cell adhesion/cancer/melanoma research in the years to come. Specifically, the plan is to pursue the following training activities: 1.) Acquire expertise in studying melanoma using mouse models; use these models to test and optimize drugs and drugs combinations. 2.) Acquire experience in interpreting the histological features of melanoma; broaden my understanding of the biological concepts used by dermatopathologists to characterize melanoma. 3.) Acquire expertise in designing diagnostic biomarker studies; learn statistical methods, specifically methods that can be used to analyze complex datasets. 4.) Build the professional and leadership skills to bring together and lead an international consortium of melanoma investigators. The candidate will be mentored by a team of national experts in the field of cancer research. Mentoring and research will be carried out at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN.

"An Integrative Bioinformatics Approach to Study Single Cancer Cell Heterogeneity DESCRIPTION:  My long term career goal is to become a leading expert in translational bioinformatics who creates, develops and applies computational and statistical methods to reveal landscapes of cancers and to identify strategies to cure cancers. Human cancers are highly heterogeneous. Such heterogeneity is the major source of the ultimate failure of most cancer agents. However, due to the limit of technologies, the intercellular heterogeneity has not been investigated genome wide, at single-cell level until recently. New technologies such as single-cell transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) and exome have revealed new insights and more profound complexity than was previously thought. However, so far these technologies are limited to one assay per cell. It remains a grand challenge to perform multiple, integrative assays from the same single tumor cell, in particular, from those derived from small tumor biopsies. Given the stochasticity at the single cell resolution, reproducibility and sensitivity ar daunting tasks. To overcome this challenge, I have started the single cancer cell sequencing analysis project, in collaboration with Dr. Sherman Weissman at Yale University, who is also my co-mentor of this K01 proposal. My immediate career goal is to identify genome-wide heterogeneity among single cancer cells, using the erythroleukemia K562 cell line. Towards this, I am proposing a research project on an integrative bioinformatics approach to analyze multiple types of genomics data generated from the same single leukemia cells, a timely and critical topic. Specifically, I am interested in studying the following specific aims: (1) buildinga bioinformatics pipeline to study heterogeneity of single-cell RNA-Seq, (2) building a bioinformatics pipeline to study CpG methylome of single cells, (3) building a bioinformatics pipeline to study single-cell Exome-Seq, and (4) integrate the RNA-Seq, methylome and Exome-Seq data generated from the same single cells. These single cells genomic data are provided by Dr. Sherman Weissman's lab from 30 single K562 erythroleukemia cells. I will first construct and validate in parallel, the RNA-Seq, methylome, and Exome-Seq bioinformatics pipelines optimized for single-cell analysis, and then develop and validate an integrative platform to analyze these multiple types of high-throughput data. To accomplish the research project, and to successfully transit from a junior faculty to an expert of the field, I have developed a career plan with my mentoring committee composed of four world-class experts in different fields relevant to Big Data Science: Primary Mentor Dr. Jason Moore in Bioinformatics from Dartmouth College, Co-mentor Dr. Sherman Weissman in Single-cell Genomics and Genetics from Yale University, Co-mentor Dr. Herbert Yu in Cancer Epidemiology from University of Hawaii Cancer Center and Co-mentor Dr. Jason Leigh in Big Data Visualization from the Information and Computer Science Department of University of Hawaii Manoa. I will primarily work with my four co-mentors for planning the development of my career during this award. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this K01 proposal is to integrate multiple types of high-throughput data, in particular, the transcriptome, exome-sequencing and CpG methylome data generated from single cancer cells. The proposed project is designed to address the urgent need for an integrative bioinformatics platform for mega-data generated from next-generation sequencing applications.

"Integrating multidimensional genomic data to discover clinically-relevant predictive models The goal of this NIH Pathway to Independence award is to provide Dr. Brittany Lasseigne with an extensive training program to prepare her to be an effective independent investigator who uses computational genomics to study complex human diseases. We propose a formal one-year training and mentoring program in genomics, computer science, statistics, and career development to build on her 8+ years of hands-on training, followed by a three-year structured and independent research program. Research will focus on the integration of multidimensional genomic data sets in the context of complex human diseases. A critical barrier in genomic research is the complexity of data integration: the ability to leverage overlapping and unique information captured by different genomic assays would improve our understanding of data integration and generate clinically relevant genomic signatures. To meet this need, we propose to integrate a combination of genomic data we generated with public data to (1) infer genomic instability signatures from different data types, (2) improve clinically relevant phenotype prediction by building multi-omics machine learning classifiers and reducing phenotype heterogeneity, and (3) create a cloud-enabled R package and associated Shiny application to accelerate future research. The proposed work will advance our understanding of data integration, allow inference of genomic instabilities across data sets, and generate high performance classifiers for assessing clinically relevant phenotypes in both cancer and psychiatric disease using frameworks that will be broadly applicable across other complex diseases. It will also facilitate prioritization of experiments in future studies by informing on the orthogonality of genomic assays, thereby allowing more efficient study designs to capture as much information as possible within a given sample size or scope of experimentation. Collectively, this additional training will allow Dr. Lasseigne to develop new multidimensional data integration approaches and translational questions applicable across complex diseases when independent. Dr. Richard Myers (HudsonAlpha) and Dr. Gregory Cooper (HudsonAlpha), leaders in applying genetics and genomics to complex human diseases, and an Advisory Committee of additional experts including Dr. Barbara Wold (Caltech), Dr. Eddy Yang (UAB), and Dr. Timothy Reddy (Duke), will provide mentoring throughout this award. The mentored phase will take place at the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology, an ideal environment for this training with extensive translational science collaborations, expert faculty and staff, and state-of-the art computational and laboratory resources devoted to genomics. This combination will maximize Dr. Lasseigne's training program, facilitating her transition to an independent, tenure-track investigator at a university with a strong commitment to data-driven approaches to complex human disease research, i.e. strong genomics research programs with clinical collaborators, ideally at, or affiliated with, an academic medical center. Project Narrative The major outcome of this project will be a scientist with the necessary research, mentoring, teaching, and career development training to run an independent research program in computational genomics. The research proposed will apply novel strategies to further develop integrative machine learning analyses of multidimensional genomic data, discover clinically relevant predictive models, and create computational tools to accelerate future research.",Integrating multidimensional genomic data to discover clinically-relevant predictive models,9526698,K99HG009678,"['Academic Medical Centers ', ' University Medical Centers ', ' Award ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biotechnology ', ' Biotech ', ' Budgets ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chromosomes ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Environment ', ' Faculty ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Institutes ', ' Laboratories ', ' Mentors ', ' Methodology ', ' Methylation ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Neurons ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Phenotype ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Running ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Standardization ', ' statistics ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Testing ', ' Training Programs ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' promoter ', ' promotor ', ' Yang ', ' Lasso ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Visualization ', ' Imagery ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Sample Size ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' programs ', ' Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure ', ' cancer chemotherapy ', ' Quimioterapia ', ' Combination Chemotherapy Regimen ', ' Chemotherapy, Cancer, General ', ' Chemotherapy Regimen ', ' Chemotherapy Protocol ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' Cell Proliferation ', ' Cellular Proliferation ', ' Cell Multiplication ', ' Cell Growth in Number ', ' Performance ', ' computer science ', ' Structure ', ' Gene Proteins ', ' Protein Gene Products ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' Genomics ', ' Genomic Instability ', ' Genome Instability ', ' Microsatellite Instability ', ' MicroRNAs ', ' miRNAs ', ' miRNA ', ' Micro RNA ', ' Chromosomal Instability ', ' Chromosome Instability ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Copy Number Polymorphism ', ' copy number variation ', ' copy number variant ', ' CpG Island Methylator Phenotype ', ' CIMP ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' molecular signature ', ' molecular profile ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Clinical Data ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' protein metabolite ', ' Instruction ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' data integration ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' Coupling ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' Bioconductor ', ' human disease ', ' data reduction ', ' single cell sequencing ', ' tenure process ', ' tenure track ', ' multi-omics ', ' multiple omics ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic classifier ', ' genomic signature ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' biomarker utility ', ' biomarker performance ', ' ']",NHGRI,HUDSON-ALPHA INSTITUTE FOR BIOTECHNOLOGY,K99,2018,112117,AL-05,0.031555263478326635
"A BRAIN Initiative Resource: The Neuroscience Multi-omic Data Archive Project Summary The Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative promotes the development and application of technologies to describe the temporal and spatial dynamics of cell types and neural circuits in the brain. The Principal Investigator, senior personnel and staff of this project have diverse expertise required to marshall data across the BRAIN Initiative consortium, including experience in data collection from multiple institutions, large-scale quality control and analysis processing capability, familiarity with NIH policy and public archive deposition strategies. To promote smooth interactions across a large research consortium, we will develop the Neuroscience Multi-Omic Archive (NeMO Archive), a data repository that is specifically focused on the storage and dissemination of omic data from the BRAIN Initiative and related brain research projects. We will utilize a federated model for data storage such that the physical location of data can be distributed between the NeMO local file system, public repositories, and a cloud-based storage system (e.g. Amazon S3). We will leverage this capability and distribute BRAIN Initiative data between our local filesystem and the cloud. The Nemo Archive will be a data resource consistent with the principles advanced by research community members who are launching resources in next generation NIH data ecosystem. These practices include FAIR Principles, documentation of APIs, data-indexing systems, workflow sharing, use of shareable software pipelines and storage on cloud-based systems. The information incorporating into the NeMO archive will, in part, enable understanding of 1) genomic regions associated with brain abnormalities and disease; 2) transcription factor binding sites and other regulatory elements; 3) transcription activity; 4) levels of cytosine modification; and 5) histone modification profiles and chromatin accessibility. It will enable users to answer diverse questions of relevance to brain research, such as identifying diagnostic candidates, predicting prognosis, selecting treatments, and testing hypotheses. It will also provide the basic knowledge to guide the development and execution of predictive and machine learning algorithms in the future.   Project Narrative The Neuroscience Multi-Omic Archive (NeMO Archive) is a data repository that is specifically focused on the storage and dissemination of omic data from the BRAIN Initiative and related brain research projects.",A BRAIN Initiative Resource: The Neuroscience Multi-omic Data Archive,9565669,R24MH114788,"['Algorithms ', ' Archives ', ' Atlases ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Combining Site ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Chromatin ', ' Communities ', ' Cytosine ', ' Data Collection ', ' Elements ', ' Future ', ' indexing ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Patients ', ' Personnel Staffing ', ' Phenotype ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prognosis ', ' Quality Control ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Running ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Standardization ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' transcription factor ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Ecological Systems ', ' Ecologic Systems ', ' Ecosystem ', ' Visualization ', ' Imagery ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Ensure ', ' Ingestion ', ' Individual ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' Policies ', ' data storage ', ' data retrieval ', ' Data Storage and Retrieval ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' Deposition ', ' Deposit ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' cell type ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Services ', ' data management ', ' experience ', ' Familiarity ', ' member ', ' neural circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' Modeling ', ' repository ', ' Documentation ', ' complex R ', ' cis-(Rh(biq)2Cl2)Cl ', "" Rh (2,2'-biquinoline) complex "", ' histone modification ', ' computerized data processing ', ' data processing ', ' Institution ', ' Data ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Reproducibility ', ' genomic region ', ' Genomic Segment ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Process ', ' Docking ', ' Modification ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' meta data ', ' Metadata ', ' work group ', ' working group ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' data integration ', ' Data Coordination Center ', ' Data Coordinating Center ', ' next generation ', ' visualization tool ', ' Visualization software ', ' Bioconductor ', ' brain research ', ' data base structure ', ' database structure ', ' operation ', ' cloud based ', ' data visualization ', ' multi-omics ', ' multiple omics ', ' data archive ', ' brain abnormalities ', ' web-based resource ', ' web resource ', ' online compendium ', ' on-line resource ', ' on-line compendium ', ' internet resource ', ' online resource ', ' cloud-based storage ', ' cloud storage ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' data resource ', ' innovative neurotechnologies ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Banks ', ' data warehouse ', ' data deposition ', ' data submission ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R24,2018,1293101,MD-07,-0.02155119663253706
"Health, Neighborhood Context, and Mobility Neighborhood context may be an upstream cause of economic mobility, yet few neighborhood studies are experimental, weakening causal inference and limiting policy translation. Our study proposes to analyze newly- available data from a large, federal government initiated social experiment of voluntary neighborhood relocation using housing vouchers in 5 US cities (the Moving to Opportunity, MTO, Study). Our project will test whether, how, and among whom random assignment of an offer to move to a lower-poverty neighborhood influenced the economic mobility of 4600 low-income families over a 15 year period. The goal of MTO was to interrupt the cascading effects of neighborhood poverty for minority low-income families, by increasing area- based access to opportunities, and thereby promote economic mobility. Although the MTO voucher intervention did not consistently affect economic outcomes, it did profoundly affect health. Unfortunately, health researchers have had limited access to MTO data, compromising the scientific payoff of the $70+ million investment. So as of yet, we have no clear understanding of why results might differ across outcomes, groups, or what mechanisms are at play, since few studies have tested mediation or moderation. Since health is one of the most important barriers to economic self-sufficiency among low-income parents, it is conceivable that economic and employment gains were concentrated among families who first experienced health improvements. However testing whether factors that occurred after random assignment are precursors for other outcomes is methodologically challenging. Fortunately, recent methodological developments in the epidemiology discipline offer cogent solutions to model this complexity and bound any bias. We propose secondary data analyses with newly available 15 year follow-up data from this experiment, to test whether health influenced the economic effects of the randomized MTO housing voucher treatment. Paired with this experimental design, we propose to apply innovative causal methods and machine learning techniques for assessing mediation and effect modification, to overcome limitations and potential bias of traditional approaches, and strengthen causal inference. Our R01 project builds on a productive, interdisciplinary team, experienced with the MTO data, and draws on a barriers-to-employment framework. We propose 4 aims to determine: whether the effect of MTO on economic outcomes was modified by baseline health vulnerability; whether MTO improved parental economic outcomes, if they or their children experienced health gains; whether MTO improved children’s employment and education, if they experienced health gains; whether MTO improved economic outcomes, if families moved to neighborhoods with fewer spatial barriers to employment. Our findings have direct policy relevance since they address a key policy question in housing voucher implementation: incorporating elements from non-housing sectors (e.g., health, employment, education) to promote moves to higher opportunity neighborhoods, to ultimately improve outcomes for low income families. This project will test whether health-related barriers to employment mediate and moderate the effects of a social experiment of housing and neighborhood relocation on economic mobility, among adolescents, young adults, and their mothers. This knowledge will inform the next generation of social policy, e.g., to provide guidance on augmenting housing counseling assistance services to include health-related additional program supports and cross-sectoral services (e.g. health management or substance use treatment services) for vulnerable families.","Health, Neighborhood Context, and Mobility",9567602,R01HD090014,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Budgets ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Development ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Cities ', ' Counseling ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Economics ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Elements ', ' Employment ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Family ', ' Federal Government ', ' National Government ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Housing ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' indexing ', ' Investments ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mothers ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Parents ', ' Play ', ' Poverty ', ' Privatization ', ' Public Housing ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Wages ', ' Salaries ', ' Social Policies ', ' Testing ', ' Translations ', ' Weight ', ' Measures ', ' Data Compromising ', ' Mediating ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Discipline ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' interdisciplinary collaboration ', ' transdisciplinary collaboration ', ' cohort ', ' Family health status ', ' Family Health ', ' Participant ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' voucher ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Low income ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Interruption ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Modification ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' next generation ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' treatment effect ', ' volunteer ', ' economic outcome ', ' treatment group ', ' improved outcome ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' lower income families ', ' welfare ', ' treatment services ', ' healthcare management ', ' health management ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2018,485287,MN-05,-0.016401010235932014
"HERCULES: Exposome Research Center PROJECT SUMMARY: HERCULES The vision of the HERCULES P30 is to demonstrably advance the role of environmental health sciences in clinical and public health settings using the platform of the exposome. Healthcare and biomedical research have become increasingly genome-centric. While much of this is due to the impressive achievements in genomics, which have consistently outpaced gains in environmental health, it is our contention that a more persuasive case needs to be made for environmental factors. Science and intuition support the idea that the environment plays just as large of a role as genetics for the majority of diseases. The exposome, which embraces a strategy and scale similar to genomic research, is poised to elevate the environment in discussions of health and disease. We will continue to grow and enhance the environmental health science research portfolio at Emory through cutting-edge technologies and innovative data solutions. We will build upon the superb relationships we have built with the local community and continue to push the mission of NIEHS on campus and across the scientific landscape. Based on the extraordinary progress over our first three years, we propose to retain our theme to use exposome-related concepts and approaches to improve human health. This simple and unifying vision will continue to stimulate discovery, promote collaboration, and enhance communication through the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. To marshal physical and intellectual resources to support exposome-related approaches (high-resolution metabolomics, analytical chemistry, systems biology, machine learning, bioinformatics, high-throughput toxicology, and spatial and temporal statistical models) through cores, pilot funding, mentoring, and research forums. Specific Aim 2. To make major contributions towards exposome and environmental health science research. Specific Aim 3. To provide career development activities around innovative and emerging concepts and approaches related to the exposome. Specific Aim 4. To enhance and expand existing relationships with community partners to resolve environmental health issues in the community using exposome principles. Specific Aim 5. To provide infrastructure and resources to facilitate rapid translation of novel scientific findings into the development of prevention and treatment strategies in humans.

"Spatial Genomics for in situ single cell expression analysis in the brain Summary Identifying the spatial organization of tissues at cellular resolution from single cell gene expression profiles is essential to understanding neurological systems. We have developed a spatial genomics approach that allows in situ 3D multiplexed imaging of many genes in single cells called sequential Fluorescence in situ hybridization (seqFISH). This technology can profile transcriptional states of single cells directly in their native tissue context with up to 249 genes multiplexed with single molecule sensitivity on each gene. We have demonstrated over 15,000 cells profiled in mouse brain slices. This SBIR project will be focused on the design, production and optimization of an instrument that allows hundreds of genes to be multiplexed and imaged in single cells within their native tissue context. The resulting machine will be commercially launched and targeted to imaging or sequencing cores at research institutions. We will design the hardware, code the control software, and build the prototype instrument. We will engineer the hardware component including automated fluidics and multiple camera imaging system with a parallel effort to develop software controls as well as integrated analysis tools. In phase II, we will beta-test the instrument, generate probe sets for gene panels targeting different brain samples, and receive valuable feedback from users and optimize our instrument design. Narrative A major challenge of the BRAIN initiative and international Human Cell Atlas project is to identifying distinct cell populations in the brain within their native spatial environment. Addressing this challenge is essential not only to fundamental biological questions of understanding how different cell types interact to form neural circuits, but also essential in investigating mechanisms of human diseases where small subpopulations of cells, such as microglial, play pivotal roles. We have developed an in situ 3D multiplexed imaging method called sequential Fluorescence in situ hybridization (seqFISH), that can profile transcriptional states of single cells directly in a mouse coronal section with up to 249 genes multiplexed in the hippocampus and the cortex (Shah et al., Neuron 2016, Frieda et al., Nature 2016). Delivering this technology as a robust platform that can be used by neuroscientists would enable breakthrough discoveries and treatment options. To make this technology available for a broad range of users and customers, this phase I SBIR project will be focused on the design, production and optimization of an instrument called seqFISH100 and the parallel development of the control software to operate the seqFISH100.",Spatial Genomics for in situ single cell expression analysis in the brain,9748985,R43MH115538,"['Adoption ', ' Algorithms ', ' Atlases ', ' Automation ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Feedback ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hippocampus ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hypothalamic structure ', ' hypothalamic ', ' Hypothalamus ', ' Institutes ', ' Methods ', ' Mus ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Neuroglia ', ' nerve cement ', ' Non-neuronal cell ', ' Neuroglial Cells ', "" Kolliker's reticulum "", ' Glial Cells ', ' Glia ', ' Neurons ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Play ', ' Production ', ' Reagent ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Work ', ' Custom ', ' Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization ', ' FISH assay ', ' FISH analysis ', ' FISH Technique ', ' FISH Technic ', ' Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization ', ' base ', ' Microscope ', ' Site ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Measurement ', ' Clinical Pathways ', ' Liquid substance ', ' liquid ', ' fluid ', ' Effector Cell ', ' Contracts ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' tool ', ' instrument ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' In Situ ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' neural circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' Sampling ', ' software development ', ' developing computer software ', ' develop software ', ' single molecule ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Genomics ', ' Manufacturer Name ', ' Manufacturer ', ' Drops ', ' Institution ', ' imaging modality ', ' imaging method ', ' image-based method ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' Address ', ' DNA Sequencing Facility ', ' Sequencing Core ', ' International ', ' Resolution ', ' Slice ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' touchscreen panel ', ' touch screen panel ', ' touch screen ', ' touch panel ', ' touchscreen ', ' visualization tool ', ' Visualization software ', ' scale up ', ' Population ', ' user-friendly ', ' human disease ', ' fluorescent imaging ', ' fluorescence imaging ', ' prototype ', ' operation ', ' genomic strategy ', ' genomic effort ', ' Genomic approach ', ' data visualization ', ' BRAIN initiative ', ' imaging system ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' ']",NIMH,"SPATIAL GENOMICS, INC.",R43,2018,30000,CA-27,-0.02082518040279404
"Development of tools for site-directed analysis of gene function The overarching goal of this application is to create tools and efficient methods to define genes that can promote human health. While a tremendous amount of data has been cataloged on gene mutation and changes in gene expression associated with complex human disease, our understanding of those genes that could be co-opted to restore patient health is lacking. To address this need and test for genes that when restored to wild type function promote health, we propose develop mutagenic, revertible and conditional alleles that provide spatial and temporal control of gene expression. The ability to make site-specific, untagged mutant alleles in zebrafish and other models has been greatly advanced by custom nucleases that include TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9 systems. These systems operate on the same principle: they are designed to bind to specific sequences in the genome and create a double strand break. The goals of this proposal leverage the activities of TALEN and CRISPR/Cas9 technologies to make site-specific double strand breaks. First, we propose to develop a suite of vectors to make integration alleles that are highly mutagenic and allow production of conditional and revertible alleles. Second, we propose to develop methods to generate predictable alleles in zebrafish at TALEN- and CRISPR/Cas9-induced double strand break sites by invoking the microhomology mediated end-joining pathway. Third, leveraging our preliminary data, we propose to improve methods for homology directed repair with oligonucleotides to create disease associated alleles in zebrafish and for site-specific integration using homologous recombination at TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9 cut sites. Fourth, we propose use single-strand annealing at TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9 cut sites to promote precise transgene integration to make tagged and highly mutagenic allele. These tools and techniques will have direct implications for providing precise gene editing techniques to assess the roles of genes in disease and their ability to promote health following disease progression. While we will develop these methodologies in zebrafish due to their ease of gene delivery, we anticipate these methodologies will not only enhance the efficiency of gene editing but will be readily adaptable for use in other model organisms and large animals. In our opinion, this will have important implications for modeling human disease and health in animal systems by greatly enhancing the ability to make predictible alleles, small nucleotide polymorphisms similar to those associated with human disease, and conditional alleles to test for the ability of a gene to restore health. The central goal for this application is to define genes that can promote or restore human health. For this, we propose to develop efficient integration of highly mutagenic and conditional cassettes into genes in a site-directed manner. The strategies proposed employ the ability of designer nucleases to create DNA double strand breaks and to site-specifically direct biochemical activities to genes of interest. The technologies developed will have important implications for modeling human disease in animal systems.",Development of tools for site-directed analysis of gene function,9748677,R24OD020166,"['Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Animals ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communities ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Embryo ', ' Embryonic ', ' Gene Expression ', ' gene therapy ', ' genetic therapy ', ' gene-based therapy ', ' Genetic Intervention ', ' Gene Transfer Clinical ', ' DNA Therapy ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Promotion ', ' promoting health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Laboratories ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Microinjections ', ' Biological Models ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Nucleotides ', ' Oligonucleotides ', ' oligos ', ' Oligo ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Patients ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' polymorphism ', ' Production ', ' Proteins ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publishing ', ' Reagent ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Work ', ' Zebrafish ', ' Zebra Fish ', ' Zebra Danio ', ' Danio rerio ', ' Brachydanio rerio ', ' recombinase ', ' Generations ', ' Mutagenesis ', ' Mutagenesis Molecular Biology ', ' Genetics-Mutagenesis ', ' Mediating ', ' Custom ', ' method development ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' repair ', ' repaired ', ' Biochemical ', ' insight ', ' Recovery ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Systems Integration ', ' Collaborations ', ' Transgenes ', ' gene function ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Catalogs ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' Gene Mutation ', ' Gene Alteration ', ' mutant ', ' nuclease ', ' homologous recombination ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' Modeling ', ' functional genomics ', ' Genomics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Binding ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Regenerative Medicine ', ' Address ', ' DNA Double Strand Break ', ' Data ', ' Mutate ', ' gene modification ', ' Gene-Modified ', ' Validation ', ' Modification ', ' Gene Delivery ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Operating System ', ' vector ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Genome engineering ', ' site-specific integration ', ' human disease ', ' therapeutic target ', ' iPSCs ', ' iPSC ', ' iPS ', ' induced pluripotent stem cell ', ' tool development ', ' therapeutic agent development ', ' therapeutic development ', ' Cas nuclease technology ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 technology ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 ', ' CRISPR/Cas method ', ' CRISPR-based tool ', ' CRISPR-based technology ', ' CRISPR-based technique ', ' CRISPR-based method ', ' CRISPR-CAS-9 ', ' CRISPR technology ', ' CRISPR technique ', ' CRISPR methodology ', ' CRISPR method ', ' CRISPR/Cas technology ', ' TALENs ', ' TALEN technology ', ' TALE nuclease ', ' TAL endonuclease ', ' TAL effector nuclease ', ' transcription activator-like effector nucleases ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' human model ', ' ']",OD,IOWA STATE UNIVERSITY,R24,2018,61319,IA-04,-0.007549041916967939
"Omics data integration and analysis for structure-based multi-target drug design Abstract Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS), whole genome sequencing, and high-throughput techniques have generated vast amounts of diverse omics and phenotypic data. However, these sets of data have not yet been fully explored to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of drug discovery, which continues along the one- drug-one-gene paradigm. Consequently, the cost of bringing a drug to market is staggering, and the failure rate is daunting. Our long-term goal is to revive the lagging pharmaceutical pipeline by identifying robust methods for achieving precision medicine. We will achieve this goal by developing a novel structural systems pharmacology approach to drug discovery, which integrates structure-based drug design with heterogeneous omics data integration and analysis in the context of the whole human and pathogen genome and interactome. An increasing body of evidence from both our group and others suggests that most drugs commonly interact with multiple receptors (targets). Both strong and weak multiple drug-target interactions can collectively mediate drug efficacy, toxicity, and resistance through the conformational dynamics of biomolecules. In order to rationally design potent, safe, and precision medicine, we face one of the major unsolved challenges in structure-based drug design: what are all the possible proteins and their conformational states interacting with a drug in an organism? This proposal attempts to address this challenge by developing, disseminating, and experimentally testing novel computational tools. Based on our successful preliminary results, we will develop an integrated computational pipeline to identify three-dimensional (3D) protein-chemical interaction models in the cellular context and on a structural proteome scale. Specifically, we will develop a quaternary structure- centric multi-layered network model by integrating heterogeneous data from genomics, proteomics, and phenomics. We will develop a novel collaborative one-class collaborative filtering algorithm to infer missing relations in the multi-layered network. We will combine tools derived from structural bioinformatics, biophysics, and machine learning to gain biological insights into the drug action. To facilitate the usability and reproducibility of the proposed algorithms, we will develop community-based web resources established by our previous experiences in developing the Protein Data Bank (PDB). More importantly, we will work closely with experimental laboratories to test the proposed computational tools using targeted kinase polypharmacology as a real-world example, and iteratively improve the performance and usability of algorithm, software, and web services. The successful completion of this project will provide the scientific community with: (1) new methods to enhance the scope and capability of high-throughput screening for structure-based multi-target drug design; (2) a user-friendly web service to support community-based drug discovery; and (3) potential novel anti-cancer targeted therapeutics. Together, these tools will advance drug discovery and precision medicine by providing a structural systems pharmacology toolkit. Relevance Statement The pharmaceutical industry is in a dire state. Both the cost to launch a new drug and the attrition rate are increasing. Methods that can correlate drug-target interactions with clinical outcomes will reduce both the cost of drug development and mortality rates during clinical trials and treatments.",Omics data

"The Nomenclature of Human and Vertebrate Genes PROJECT SUMMARY - HGNC The core objective of the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) is to enable effective communication and data exchange between everyone with an interest in human genes, by providing a unique, concise and standardized gene symbol and name for every human gene. As usage of genomic data increases in healthcare the need for a consistent language for genes becomes ever more vital. Aim 1 of this proposal will ensure the continuity of standardized naming of novel human protein-coding genes, long and small non-protein-coding RNA (ncRNA) genes, and pseudogenes. In particular all putative novel protein coding loci will require careful consideration; as active members of the Consensus Coding Sequence (CCDS) consortium, HGNC can ensure that named loci accurately reflect the current expert manual annotations provided by consortium members. Aim 2 concentrates on renaming newly characterized human genes that are currently assigned a placeholder symbol; some genes with a phenotype-based nomenclature will also be considered for reassignment. These updates will reflect functional information, aid name transferal to orthologous genes, and avoid confusion. This round of revision will be a precursor to a nomenclature freeze for the majority of protein coding genes. Aim 3 focusses on coordinating gene naming across vertebrates, collaborating with the six existing vertebrate gene nomenclature committees (mouse, rat, chicken, Anolis, Xenopus, zebrafish) which base their naming on human gene nomenclature. As the Vertebrate Gene Nomenclature Committee (VGNC) this effort will be extended to naming genes in vertebrates lacking a nomenclature authority, such as cow, dog and horse. Recent gene naming in chimpanzee enabled creation of the necessary tools, pipelines and databases required for naming in other species. Assignments will reflect homologous relationships to human genes. Aim 4 will investigate the utility of machine learning in automated assignment of systematic nomenclature to long ncRNA genes and vertebrate orthologs, and potentially to pseudogenes. Models will be trained on manually curated datasets to learn both explicit and implicit practices, and then applied at scale. Aim 5 will ensure consistent naming across vertebrates in complex and divergent gene families, which can reveal some of the most interesting evolutionary biology and account for key diversity between species, but require careful manual curation. HGNC will collaborate with experts to expand the successful gene naming in the pharmacologically relevant cytochrome P450 (CYP) family to further species, also working across species on two other complex key families involved in detoxification, the glutathione S-transferases (GST) and UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs). HGNC will also work with experts to expand gene naming of olfactory receptors, the largest vertebrate gene family, from mammals to other well- studied model organisms such as zebrafish, Xenopus and chicken. HGNC is the only group worldwide providing systematic and user-friendly names for genes that are used throughout biomedical science and clinical practice; this is a crucial facility, with increasing importance and direct benefits for public health. To ensure effective communication between basic and clinical researchers, practicing clinicians and patients, there has to be a consistent well managed set of names for all human genes, which HGNC has provided since 1979. Having these names enables new discoveries, avoids confusion and prevents patient harm, by helping to ensure that everyone refers to a given gene using the same name.",The Nomenclature of Human and Vertebrate Genes,9527894,U24HG003345,"['Vertebrate Animals ', ' Work ', ' Xenopus ', ' clawed frog ', ' Xenopus sp.

"Pharmaco Response Signatures and Disease Mechanism DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the HMS LINCS Center is to delineate the fundamental principles of cellular response to perturbagens at the level of single-cells and cell populations and to make response data routinely available via web-based browse, query and programmatic interfaces. This will involve the development and testing of new measurement methods, computational algorithms, and response signatures for diverse human cell types exposed to perturbations individually and in combination. We will emphasize the systematic collection of data not currently available in existing public databases including live and fixed-cell imaging, biochemical data on signaling proteins and multi-factorial drug-response phenotypes. A focus on diverse transformed and primary cells, including those derived from healthy and diseased donors, and on clinical grade small molecules (kinase inhibitors and epigenome drugs) will increase the translational impact of our work. The proposed LINCS Center represents a continuation of a program in operation for ~3.5 years under a LINCS pilot phase U54 award. We will expand the scope and sophistication of our Center, devoting  significant effort to (i) improving the quality of data analysis and visualization, particularly wih respect to the  complexities of perturbagen polypharmacy (ii) accelerating the release of perturbagen-response signatures  using methods that have been demonstrated to yield reliable and informative data, with a particular  emphasis on primary and non-transformed cells (iii) developing and applying new measurement methods,  particularly mass spectrometry for analysis of cell populations and live-cell imaging for analysis of single cells.  The work will involve nine complementary but independent aims. In Data Generation, Aim 1 will perform systematic analysis of perturbagen responses at a single-cell level. Aim 2 will collect multiplex protein and mRNA data on perturbagen response using a set of complementary imaging, mass spectrometry and bead-based assays. Aim 3 will apply LINCS methods to non-transformed immune cells and induced pluripotent stem cells, and explore if signatures can guide a detailed medicinal chemistry campaign. In Data Analysis, Aim 4 will construct perturbagen-response signatures using statistical modeling, network inference and machine learning methods. Aim 5 will develop new approaches to understanding and analyzing drug interactions on multiple phenotypes in single cells. Aim 6 will develop a novel compressed sensing framework for analyzing the poly-pharmacology of kinase inhibitors. Aim 7 will enhance the query, browse and explore functions of the HMS LINCS website and database and its integration with the UCSC Genome Browser. In Community Interaction and Outreach, Aim 8 will implement diverse training and outreach activities, including collaboration with LINCS and non-LINCS research groups. In Administration, Aim 9 will ensure effective management of the Center, sustained access to tools and data produced within the LINCS Project, and compliance with program goals. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Disease networks are complex interactions between multiple proteins. Precise understanding of the multifactorial perturbations imposed on multi-component networks is a crucial step in the development of a rational approach to drug discovery and personalization of therapy. The LINCS Center we propose will develop innovative computational and experimental methods for understanding cellular perturbagen-response networks and will make the resulting data and new knowledge accessible to the diverse community of molecular and computational biologists, medicinal chemists and clinical investigators through outreach.",Pharmaco Response Signatures and Disease

"EMR-Linked Biobank for Translational Genomics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medical care informed by genomic information is beginning to move into clinical practice. The Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network through its initial phases has provided much of the groundwork for this transformation. The Geisinger Health System project, ""EMR-Linked Biobank for Translational Genomics"" intends to build on the knowledge and experience from eMERGE phase II to accelerate discovery and implementation while expanding our understanding of the sociocultural implications of genomics in medicine. We will accomplish this goal through three specific aims: 1) Use existing biospecimens, genotype and sequence data and EMR-generated phenotypes for discovery in the proposed disorders: familial hypercholesterolemia and chronic rhinosinusitis, 2) Develop and test approaches for implementation of genomic information in clinical practice, 3) Explore, develop and implement novel approaches for family-centered communication around clinically relevant genomic results. We currently have over 60,000 patients broadly consented for research with a large and increasing proportion consented for return of results and deposition in the electronic health record. Over 18,000 patients are genotyped on high density platforms. Our two proposed phenotypes, familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) were chosen because both conditions have a significant public health impact in the United States, but they are also ideally suited to the specific aims of the project. They provide opportunities for innovation and extension of current eMERGE methods. While many of these innovations will take advantage of the sequencing done as part of the project, there are several other areas emphasized in the funding opportunity that will broaden the scope of eMERGE research. One of the areas of emphasis for eMERGE III is exploring the familial return of actionable results. FH is well suited to this, as the current clinical recommendation is cascade testing of family members for all diagnosed patients. Currently this relies on the patient to contact at risk family members, but this is less than optimal. We will explore this issue using qualitative and quantitative methods and use the results to design and test novel family communication strategies. Gene-environment interactions play an important role in the development and severity of disease. These are very difficult to study. We propose novel approaches that leverage the assets of Geisinger Health System and the eMERGE Network to develop and apply methods to extend existing projects that study the impact of environment on CRS. This would include the first large scale environment-wide association studies (EWAS). Finally, we propose to lead efforts to apply the tools of economic modeling and analysis to eMERGE projects to begin to quantify the value of implementation of genomic medicine in the US healthcare system. These proposed innovations will magnify the already significant impact that the eMERGE program has had in moving genomic medicine from a dream to a reality. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Through this application GHS seeks to continue its participation in the eMERGE Network for Phase III - Study Investigators U01 (RFA-HG-14-025) funding opportunity. We propose 3 specific aims: 1) use existing biospecimens, genotype and sequence data and EMR-generated phenotypes for discovery and validation of gene-phenotype associations; 2) develop and test approaches for implementation of genomic information in clinical practice;

"Accelerating the diagnosis of bipolar disorder using genetic and phenotypic signatures PROJECT SUMMARY The diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder (BPD), a heritable disorder characterized by periods of depression and mania, is extremely challenging in clinical practice and takes on average 5-10 years. One of the main reasons for this delay is that the majority of patients first manifest depressive symptoms (depression-first BPD), often resulting in misdiagnosis with major depressive disorder (MDD). Misdiagnosis can lead to poor clinical outcomes, increased burden for patients and high healthcare costs. The goal of this proposal is to identify genetic and phenotypic signatures that distinguish depression-first BPD from MDD, in order to accelerate BPD diagnosis. During the mentored phase (K99) of the award, the PI will perform a genome wide association study to characterize the genetic architecture of differences between depression-first BPD and MDD, using available data from the collaborative Psychiatrics Genetics Consortium (Aim 1a). In a Dutch BPD cohort (n=1,750 cases) she will use machine learning methods to identify molecular, neuro-cognitive and behavioral profiles to classify depression-first BPD versus mania-first BPD (BPD with first onset of mania) and identify causal relations among predictive features (Aim 1b). During the independent phase (R00) of the award, the PI will study BPD diagnosis in a genotyped and extensively phenotyped Colombian cohort of ~5,000 cases with severe mood disorders, for which high quality electronic health records (EHR) have been collected since 2005. She will i) predict if and when patients will switch from MDD to BPD diagnosis, ii) distinguish BPD from matched MDD patients, and iii) classify BPD patients into depression-first and mania-first categories (Aims 2 and 3). She will estimate heritability of identified signatures and integrate results from both Dutch and Colombian cohorts. Building upon her expertise in complex trait genetics and method development, this award will allow the PI to extend her knowledge-base of clinical phenotyping in psychiatry; grow her expertise in statistical modeling; and strengthen her communication, mentoring, and leadership skills to prepare for a successful career as an independent researcher. The PI will complete the K99 phase of the award at UCLA, which fosters an ideal training environment. The strong advisory committee with Drs. Freimer, Ophoff, and Eskin (UCLA) and Dr. Sabatti (Stanford) will facilitate her scientific and personal development and promote her long-term career goal of tackling clinically relevant problems in psychiatric illness through the study of genetic, neuro-cognitive and behavioral mechanisms. The PI will first focus on the diagnosis of BPD, and then expand, in the future, into other psychiatric trait-mechanisms, such as disease severity and drug response. This award will be fundamental in support of her career goals. Successful completion of the specific aims of this proposal is likely to significantly improve the time to BPD diagnosis, and thereby reduce the burden of this debilitating disorder for patients and society. ! PROJECT NARRATIVE Because the majority of patients with bipolar disorder initially manifest depressive symptoms and are misdiagnosed with major depressive disorder, they often receive several years of sub-optimal treatment and experience poor clinical outcomes, until they obtain the correct diagnosis. I aim to identify genetic and phenotypic signatures that predict which patients diagnosed with depression are likely to develop bipolar disorder, which may accelerate diagnosis and reduce the burden of this disorder on patients and society.",Accelerating the diagnosis of bipolar disorder using genetic and phenotypic signatures,9505794,K99MH116115,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Antidepressive Agents ', ' anti-depressive agents ', ' anti-depressants ', ' anti-depressant drugs ', ' anti-depressant agent ', ' Antidepressants ', ' Antidepressant Drugs ', ' Antidepressant Agent ', ' Award ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communication ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Leadership ', ' Literature ', ' Mentors ', ' Methodology ', ' Statistical Models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Moods ', ' mortality ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Sampling Studies ', ' Societies ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Unipolar Depression ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' psychogenetics ', ' psychiatric genetics ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' base ', ' career ', ' method development ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' hypomanic ', ' hypomania ', ' Fostering ', ' Funding ', ' disorder onset ', ' disease onset ', ' Onset of illness ', ' Genetic ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Manic ', ' Manic State ', ' Manias ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Frequencies ', ' Source ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' Severity of illness ', ' disease severity ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' knowledge base ', ' knowledgebase ', ' trait ', ' skills ', ' member ', ' Categories ', ' Modality ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' functional disability ', ' Functional impairment ', ' Genomics ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' major depression disorder ', ' major depression ', ' clinical depression ', ' Behavioral Mechanisms ', ' behavior mechanism ', ' Mechanisms of Behavior and Behavior Change ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' Behavioral ', ' clinical phenotype ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' Complex Genetic Trait ', ' suicide morbidity ', ' suicide death ', ' suicidal morbidity ', ' severe mental disorder ', ' serious mental illness ', ' serious mental disorder ', ' persistent mental illness ', ' chronic mental illness ', ' severe mental illness ', ' Outcome ', ' Heritability ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' genome-wide ', ' clinical practice ', ' Genetic study ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' phenotypic data ', ' Colombian ', ' predictive signature ', ' optimal therapies ', ' optimal treatments ', ' genetic architecture ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K99,2018,128072,CA-33,-0.004060316442807976
"Identifying phenomic patterns of dental anomalies in orofacial clefting Project Summary/Abstract Background and Candidate: Children with orofacial clefting present with increased rate of dental anomalies in shape, size, number, symmetry, abnormal eruption and malposition of teeth both inside and outside the cleft area, leading to dental problems and reduction of quality of life. Although the scientific community has recognized these findings for a long time, the specific etiological factors underlying such anomalies still remain elusive. An important step to understanding etiology is via careful phenotypic approaches that can detect the co-occurrence of such anomalies in discernable patterns that can simplify the identification of risk factors. Dr. Brian Howe is a Clinical Assistant Professor at the College of Dentistry of the University of Iowa. His primary research focus is on the identification and characterization of oral phenotypes in an effort to identify etiological factors underlying the oral phenotypic spectrum of nonsyndromic orofacial clefting. Career Goals: Dr. Howe's short term goals are to deepen is knowledge of complex craniofacial phenotypes and expand his current understanding of craniofacial development. His long term goals are to become a funded independent researcher and a leading clinician and educator in the field of craniofacial phenomics and dentistry as a tenure track faculty at a University of Iowa. His research plan is innovative in that it leverages unique bioinformatics algorithms to identify complex oral phenotypic patterns amenable for studies of risk factors and causality. Environment: The University of Iowa has an established reputation for the successful training of graduate and postdoctoral students in research and clinical areas. It offers learning and development seminars focused on career development and advancement with particular benefits from training opportunities from its Institute for Clinical and Translational Sciences (ICTS). Career Development Plan: Dr. Howe is committed to attend courses, tutorials, seminars and relevant conferences as well as meeting regularly with his mentors, collaborators, and advisory committee to fulfill is training aims and gain the knowledge necessary to achieve his future research goals and become an independent clinical researcher. Research Study: This research aims to identify oral phenotypic patterns in orofacial clefting using modern and traditional pattern mining methods in a diverse international population with existing environmental and genetic variables. This knowledge will have key implications in our understanding of the etiology of orofacial clefting as well as driving the implementation of innovative treatment approaches to improve dental outcomes and future preventive strategies. Project Narrative  Individuals with nonsyndromic orofacial clefting present with a wide range of dental anomalies leading to more intricate oral rehabilitation procedures which increases dental morbidity and reduces quality of life in those affected. In the largest international cohort of families with orofacial clefting and controls to date, this project will utilize pattern mining approaches to detect the co-occurrence of particular dental anomalies in discernable patterns that will likely simplify the search for the etiological factors underlying these anomalies. This research will aid in our understanding of the etiology of orofacial clefting by expanding and further defining oral phenotypes which will drive biologically meaningful strategies for the identification of genetic risk factors as well as helping to improve clinical care.",Identifying phenomic patterns of dental anomalies in orofacial clefting,9582428,K08DE028012,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Awareness ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Career Mobility ', ' career transition ', ' career advancement ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Communities ', ' Dental crowns ', ' Crowns ', ' Dental Enamel ', ' tooth enamel ', ' Enamel ', ' Dentistry ', ' Environment ', ' Faculty ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Institutes ', ' Iowa ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Maxilla ', ' maxillary ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Mining ', ' Modernization ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Odontogenesis ', ' dental development ', ' Phenotype ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Students ', ' Surgical Flaps ', ' Island Flaps ', ' Flaps ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tooth structure ', ' teeth ', ' Tooth ', ' Tooth Germ ', ' Tooth Bud ', ' Universities ', ' Primary Dentition ', ' Deciduous Dentition ', ' Gender ', ' symposium ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' Mesenchymas ', ' Mesenchyme ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Calcified ', ' calcification ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' repair ', ' repaired ', ' Biological ', ' Training ', ' Mouth ', ' Cavitas Oris ', ' Buccal Cavity Head and Neck ', ' Buccal Cavity ', ' Oral cavity ', ' Dental ', ' Individual ', ' Development Plans ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Genetic ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' permanent tooth ', ' Secondary Dentition ', ' Permanent Dentition ', ' Adult Dentition ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Side ', ' Oral ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Pattern ', ' Robin bird ', ' Robin ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' meetings ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' craniofacial ', ' craniofacies ', ' professor ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' research study ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' genetic risk factor ', ' inherited factor ', ' career development ', ' Vascular blood supply ', ' vascular supply ', ' blood supply ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Preventive ', ' Age-Months ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' High Prevalence ', ' International ', ' Mesenchymal ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research ', ' trend ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' palatogenesis ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' analytical tool ', ' craniofacial complex ', ' high risk ', ' clinical care ', ' phenomics ', ' risk locus ', ' risk loci ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk gene ', ' risk allele ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' risk variant ', ' craniofacial development ', ' orofacial clefting ', ' orofacial cleft ', ' tenure process ', ' tenure track ', ' training opportunity ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,K08,2018,150636,IA-02,0.0065986589890655555
"Improving the efficiency of randomized trials of behavioral interventions for acute and chronic respiratory failure The goal of this Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research is to enhance the ability of Dr. Scott Halpern to mentor students, residents, post-doctoral fellows, and junior faculty in developing and testing behavioral economic interventions to prevent and improve outcomes following, acute and chronic respiratory failure. Patients with many forms of acute and chronic respiratory failure, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), respectively, are at high risk of death and suffer considerable short- and long-term impairments in quality of life and functioning. Behavioral interventions, including those informed by behavioral economic principles, hold great promise for preventing these conditions and improving outcomes. Yet the knowledge produced by randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of such interventions is limited due to impediments to patient accrual, patient-centered outcomes ascertainment, and the abilities of traditional analyses to determine which interventions work best for which patients. By leveraging the conceptual models, research infrastructures, and data collected in 5 of Dr. Halpern's ongoing or recently completed RCTs including 40,000 patients, Dr. Halpern and his mentees will develop and test ways to surmount each of these three barriers to producing greater knowledge on how to prevent and treat acute and chronic respiratory failure. First, they will conduct randomized trials of “nudges” to improve enrollment and retention in real RCTs. Second, they will learn and apply state-of-the-art natural language processing and machine learning techniques to enhance the ability to extract patient-centered outcomes from electronic health records, thereby identifying more efficient methods for outcome ascertainment in large, pragmatic RCTs. Third, they will learn and apply modern methods in causal inference and the detection of heterogeneous treatment effects to better understand how effective behavioral interventions are overall, how efficacious they would be if more patients adhered to them, and which interventions work best for which patients. These scientific aims will be completed within the context of a structured training program designed to improve Dr. Halpern's skills in mentoring junior patient-oriented researchers. Dr. Halpern has already successfully mentored more than two dozen patient-oriented researchers. However, by enabling him to reduce his clinical and administrative commitments, this award will increase the time he commits to mentoring, and will improve his mentoring skills by supporting didactic training in influence and leadership and “mentor-the-mentor” meetings with more senior mentors. The award will also enable him to develop a “Junior Faculty Visiting Professor Program in Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine,” thereby enhancing opportunities for his and other established investigators' mentees to network with other leaders in the field, receive external feedback and mentorship, and gain the confidence that comes with speaking to less familiar audiences. NARRATIVE Randomized clinical trials of behavioral interventions are essential to the prevention and treatment of acute and chronic respiratory failure. However, the efficiency of such trials, defined as the knowledge gained divided by the costs of completing the trials, is often quite low due to impediments to patient accrual, patient-centered outcome ascertainment, and the abilities of traditional analytic approaches to determine which interventions work best for which patients. This mid-career investigator award in patient-oriented research will develop and test methods to surmount these three barriers in the context of a multifaceted training program that will make the Principal Investigator a more effective mentor and team leader.",Improving the efficiency of randomized trials of behavioral interventions for acute and chronic respiratory

"Accelerating Multi-modal Biomarker Discovery in Translational Research with Cloud Data Integration Project Summary/Abstract Cytobank is the leading cloud-based platform for analysis and storage of single cell flow and mass cytometry data, technologies that are essential for investigating the interplay between the immune system and disease conditions including cancer. There are numerous data analysis steps between raw data and insight especially for many single-cell technologies, where the data analysis is complex, highly expert-driven and/or reliant on novel computational methodologies. Cytobank already makes major contributions (1) centralizing single-cell cytometry data, (2) providing data analysis traceability that removes knowledge sharing complexities, and (3) establishing a platform that increases access to cutting edge algorithms and makes complex machine learning methods easy for biologists to use. However, as the amount, complexity, and different types of single cell data and other associated data increases and the number of workflows and single-cell algorithms to analyze the data also increases, the need for open and easy access to existing and new tools and secure, complete storage of the workflows and the resulting data has increased to the point of being critical for supporting basic and translational research collaborations and enabling them to efficiently achieve their objectives including biomarker discovery and development. The proposed project significantly extends the capabilities of the Cytobank platform. This will benefit the community by (1) enabling scalable and secure access to a number of new single-cell data analysis tools that will result in new automated workflows, and (2) enable more efficient cross platform knowledge generation with increased meta-analysis capabilities across experiments and data types. The potential of this project is that thousands of scientists around the world will be able to more easily leverage additional single-cell cytometry, transcript, and other data in their translational research data analysis including automating analysis that has primarily been dominated by expert-driven annotation, thus providing a central repository and knowledge management framework that will accelerate biomarker discovery and precision medicine. Project Narrative Single-cell biology and Immunotherapy are exploding and generating larger and more complex datasets in combination clinical trials. To take full advantage of these revolutions, the iteration and dissemination of advanced single-cell data analysis algorithms (many of whose development was funded by the NIH) needs to scale at the same rate as single-cell data generation technologies are scaling, and multi-omics data analysis and visualization must be integrated and automated. This project will greatly accelerate scientific research, transparency, and reproducibility by significantly lowering the barrier to perform complex data analysis of multiple types of high-dimensional data, providing the biomedical research community with access to powerful tools needed in immuno-oncology, autoimmunity and other high-impact disease areas.",Accelerating Multi-modal Biomarker Discovery in Translational Research with Cloud Data Integration,9464486,R44GM117914,"['Algorithms ', ' Autoimmunity ', ' Autoimmune Status ', ' B-Lymphocytes ', ' Bursa-Equivalent Lymphocyte ', ' Bursa-Dependent Lymphocytes ', ' B-cell ', ' B-Cells ', ' B cells ', ' B cell ', ' B blood cells ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Foundations ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' Immune System Diseases ', ' Immunological System Dysfunction ', ' Immunological Dysfunction ', ' Immunological Diseases ', ' Immunologic Diseases ', ' Immunodeficiency and Immunosuppression Disorders ', ' Immune System and Related Disorders ', ' Immune System Dysfunction ', ' Immune System Disorder ', ' Immune Dysfunction ', ' Immune Disorders ', ' Immune Diseases ', ' Immunotherapy ', ' immuno therapy ', ' immune-based treatments ', ' immune-based therapies ', ' immune therapy ', ' immune therapeutic interventions ', ' Immunologically Directed Therapy ', ' Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia ', ' acute lymphomatic leukemia ', ' acute lymphogenous leukemia ', ' acute lymphatic leukemia ', ' Precursor Lymphoblastic Leukemia ', ' Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia ', ' Acute Lymphoid Leukemia ', ' Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia ', ' ALL -

"Development of mosaic mouse models of HCC for genetic interspecies inference DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a menace for human health for the lack of any effective treatment. HCC is usually the end result of chronic liver diseases associated with diverse risk factors. Furthermore, non- alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) induced HCC, which is projected to be the leading cause of new cases, remains poorly characterized. Although many mouse models of HCC have been developed, it is unclear how well they represent different subgroups of human HCCs. This research plan proposes to transform HCC animal modeling by establishing a novel in vivo platform to accurately replicate the somatic molecular profiles of human HCC in mice. To do this, three independent HCC mouse models will be exhaustively characterized through exome sequencing and gene expression profiling. Using bioinformatics techniques including machine- learning and network analysis, these datasets will be compared with human HCC datasets from TCGA and the ICGC to identify subgroups of patients with similar somatic molecular profiles to the HCC mouse models as well as refined minimum sets of characteristic genetic aberrations. A derived transposon system will be used to generate mosaic mouse models replicating human HCC genetic subgroups faithfully. These models will enable 1) experimental dissection of the molecular mechanisms underlying distinct etiologies of HCC, 2) systematic assessment of candidate HCC therapies and 3) investigation of therapeutic resistances. This K99/R00 career development award proposal describes a two-year mentored and three-year independent research program essential for the development of Dr. Font-Burgada as an independent investigator. Dr. Font-Burgada received his PhD at University of Barcelona, Spain, for the work he performed to investigate basic chromatin regulatory and epigenetic mechanisms. He then moved to University of California, San Diego where he joined Dr. Michael Karin's laboratory to train in mouse models of cancer and signal transduction. For the accomplishment of this research proposal, Dr. Font-Burgada has designed a strong training and career development plan consisting of: 1- the continued mentorship of Dr. Michael Karin to gain additional expertise in mouse models of HCC and signal transduction, 2- Training in bioinformatics, specifically in methods to identify cancer driver genetic aberrations and network-based approaches for comparative genomic analysis of mouse and human HCCs, to be overseen by co-mentor Dr. Hannah Carter, an Assistant Professor of Medicine, at UCSD. 3- Training in application of emerging transposon vector technologies to generate mosaic mouse models for in vivo analysis of oncogenic pathways. 4- Career development courses and seminars in a supportive academic environment in the Department of Pharmacology at UCSD to complement other aspects of the training program. This training plan will be overseen by an advisory committee comprising 4 members, mentor, co-mentor, and additional experts in mouse models of cancer and bioinformatics, Inder Verma and Trey Ideker, providing key scientific insights and essential guidance in critical steps in Dr. Font-Burgada transition to independence. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has a 5-year survival rate of less than 10% and leads to 700000 deaths globally each year. The genetic causes of this disease are poorly understood and the only available targeted therapy extends life expectancy by a mere 3 months. In order to improve these dismal statistics, I am developing a novel class of mouse models capable of reproducing the spectrum of mutations observed in a given human tumor, to enable study of HCC

"Transformative Computational Infrastructures for Cell-Based Biomarker Diagnostics Project Summary The presence of abnormal cell populations in patient samples is diagnostic for a variety of human diseases, especially leukemias and lymphomas. One of the main technologies used for cell-based diagnostic evaluation is flow cytometry, which employs fluorescent reagents to measure molecular characteristics of cell populations in complex mixtures. While cytometry evaluation is routinely used for the diagnosis of blood-borne malignancies, it could be more widely applied to the diagnosis of other diseases (e.g. asthma, allergy and autoimmunity) if it could be reproducibly used to interpret higher complexity staining panels and recognize more subtle cell population differences. Flow cytometry analysis is also widely used for single cell phenotyping in translational research studies to explore the mechanisms of normal and abnormal biological processes. More recently, the development of mass cytometry promises to further increase the application of single cell cytometry evaluation to understand a wide range of physiological, pathological and therapeutic processes. The current practice for cytometry data analysis relies on “manual gating” of two-dimensional data plots to identify cell subsets in complex mixtures. However, this process is subjective, labor intensive, and irreproducible making it difficult to deploy in multicenter translational research studies or clinical trials where protocol standardization and harmonization are essential. The goal of this project is to develop, validate and disseminate a user-friendly infrastructure for the computational analysis of cytometry data for both diagnostic and discovery applications that could help overcome the current limitations of manual analysis and provide for more efficient, objective and accurate analysis, through the following aims: Specific Aim 1 – Implement a novel computational infrastructure – FlowGate – for cytometry data analysis that includes visual analytics and machine learning; Specific Aim 2 – Assess the utility of FlowGate for cell population characterization in mechanistic translational research studies (T1); Specific Aim 3 – Assess the robustness and accuracy of FlowGate for clinical diagnostics in comparison with the current standard-of-care analysis of diagnostic cytometry data (T2); Specific Aim 4 – Develop training and educational resources and conduct directed outreach activities to stimulate adoption and use of the resulting FlowGate cyberinfrastructure. The project will have a major impact in advancing translational science by overcoming key hurdles for adoption of these computational methods by facilitating analysis pipeline optimization, providing intuitive user interfacing, and delivering directed training activities. The application of the developed computational infrastructure for improved diagnostics of AML and CLL will contribute to the new emphasis on precision medicine by more precisely quantifying the patient-specific characteristics of neoplastic and normal reactive cell populations. Although FlowGate will be developed by the UC San Diego, UC Irvine, and Stanford CTSAs, the resulting computational infrastructure will be made freely available to the entire research community. Project Narrative Flow cytometry analysis is widely used for single cell phenotyping in the translational research lab to explore the mechanisms of normal and abnormal biological processes and in the clinical diagnostic lab for the identification and classification of blood-borne malignancies. However, the current practice for cytometry data analysis using “manual gating” based on two-dimensional data plots is subjective, labor-intensive and unreliable, especially when using more complex high content staining panels.

"Development of tools for site-directed analysis of gene function The overarching goal of this application is to create tools and efficient methods to define genes that can promote human health. While a tremendous amount of data has been cataloged on gene mutation and changes in gene expression associated with complex human disease, our understanding of those genes that could be co-opted to restore patient health is lacking. To address this need and test for genes that when restored to wild type function promote health, we propose develop mutagenic, revertible and conditional alleles that provide spatial and temporal control of gene expression. The ability to make site-specific, untagged mutant alleles in zebrafish and other models has been greatly advanced by custom nucleases that include TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9 systems. These systems operate on the same principle: they are designed to bind to specific sequences in the genome and create a double strand break. The goals of this proposal leverage the activities of TALEN and CRISPR/Cas9 technologies to make site-specific double strand breaks. First, we propose to develop a suite of vectors to make integration alleles that are highly mutagenic and allow production of conditional and revertible alleles. Second, we propose to develop methods to generate predictable alleles in zebrafish at TALEN- and CRISPR/Cas9-induced double strand break sites by invoking the microhomology mediated end-joining pathway. Third, leveraging our preliminary data, we propose to improve methods for homology directed repair with oligonucleotides to create disease associated alleles in zebrafish and for site-specific integration using homologous recombination at TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9 cut sites. Fourth, we propose use single-strand annealing at TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9 cut sites to promote precise transgene integration to make tagged and highly mutagenic allele. These tools and techniques will have direct implications for providing precise gene editing techniques to assess the roles of genes in disease and their ability to promote health following disease progression. While we will develop these methodologies in zebrafish due to their ease of gene delivery, we anticipate these methodologies will not only enhance the efficiency of gene editing but will be readily adaptable for use in other model organisms and large animals. In our opinion, this will have important implications for modeling human disease and health in animal systems by greatly enhancing the ability to make predictible alleles, small nucleotide polymorphisms similar to those associated with human disease, and conditional alleles to test for the ability of a gene to restore health. The central goal for this application is to define genes that can promote or restore human health. For this, we propose to develop efficient integration of highly mutagenic and conditional cassettes into genes in a site-directed manner. The strategies proposed employ the ability of designer nucleases to create DNA double strand breaks and to site-specifically direct biochemical activities to genes of interest. The technologies developed will have important implications for modeling human disease in animal systems.",Development of tools for site-directed analysis of gene function,9457505,R24OD020166,"['Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Animals ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communities ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Embryo ', ' Embryonic ', ' Gene Expression ', ' gene therapy ', ' genetic therapy ', ' gene-based therapy ', ' Genetic Intervention ', ' Gene Transfer Clinical ', ' DNA Therapy ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Promotion ', ' promoting health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Laboratories ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Microinjections ', ' Biological Models ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Nucleotides ', ' Oligonucleotides ', ' oligos ', ' Oligo ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Patients ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' polymorphism ', ' Production ', ' Proteins ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publishing ', ' Reagent ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Work ', ' Zebrafish ', ' Zebra Fish ', ' Zebra Danio ', ' Danio rerio ', ' Brachydanio rerio ', ' recombinase ', ' Generations ', ' Mutagenesis ', ' Mutagenesis Molecular Biology ', ' Genetics-Mutagenesis ', ' Mediating ', ' Custom ', ' method development ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' repair ', ' repaired ', ' Biochemical ', ' insight ', ' Recovery ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Systems Integration ', ' Collaborations ', ' Transgenes ', ' gene function ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Catalogs ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' Gene Mutation ', ' Gene Alteration ', ' mutant ', ' nuclease ', ' homologous recombination ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' Modeling ', ' functional genomics ', ' Genomics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Binding ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Regenerative Medicine ', ' Address ', ' DNA Double Strand Break ', ' Data ', ' Mutate ', ' gene modification ', ' Gene-Modified ', ' Validation ', ' Modification ', ' Gene Delivery ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Operating System ', ' vector ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Genome engineering ', ' site-specific integration ', ' human disease ', ' therapeutic target ', ' iPSCs ', ' iPSC ', ' iPS ', ' induced pluripotent stem cell ', ' tool development ', ' therapeutic agent development ', ' therapeutic development ', ' Cas nuclease technology ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 technology ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 ', ' CRISPR/Cas method ', ' CRISPR-based tool ', ' CRISPR-based technology ', ' CRISPR-based technique ', ' CRISPR-based method ', ' CRISPR-CAS-9 ', ' CRISPR technology ', ' CRISPR technique ', ' CRISPR methodology ', ' CRISPR method ', ' CRISPR/Cas technology ', ' TALENs ', ' TALEN technology ', ' TALE nuclease ', ' TAL endonuclease ', ' TAL effector nuclease ', ' transcription activator-like effector nucleases ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' human model ', ' ']",OD,IOWA STATE UNIVERSITY,R24,2018,739983,IA-04,-0.007549041916967939
"Integrative Bioinformatics Approaches to Human Brain Genomics and Connectomics Project Summary (Abstract)  Human brain connectomics and imaging genomics are two emerging research fields enabled by recent advances in multi-modal neuroimaging and high throughput omics technologies. Integrating brain imaging genomics and connectomics holds great promise for a systematic characterization of both the human brain connectivity and the connectivity-based neurobiological pathway from its genetic architecture to its influences on cognition and behavior. Rich multi-modal neuroimaging data coupled with high density omics data are available from large-scale landmark studies such as the NIH Human Connectome Project (HCP) and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). The unprecedented scale and complexity of these data sets, however, have presented critical computational bottlenecks requiring new concepts and enabling tools.  To bridge the gap, this project is proposed to develop and validate novel integrative bioinformatics approaches to human brain genomics and connectomics, and has three aims. Aim 1 is to develop a novel computational pipeline for a systematic characterization of structural connectome optimized for imaging genomics, where special consideration will be taken to address important issues including reliable tractography and network construction, systematic extraction of network attributes, identification of important network components (e.g., hubs, communities and rich clubs), prioritization of network attributes towards genomic analysis, and identification of outcome-relevant network measures. Aim 2 is to develop novel bioinformatics strategies to determining genetic basis of structural connectome, including novel approaches for analyzing graph-based phenotype data and learning outcome-relevant associations, and an ensemble of effective learning modules to handle a comprehensive set of scenarios on mining genome-connectome associations at the genome-wide connectome-wide scale. Aim 3 is to develop a visual analytic software system for interactive visual exploration and mining of fiber-tracts and brain networks with their genetic determinants and functional outcomes, where new visualization and exploration methods will be implemented for seamlessly combining human expertise and machine intelligence to enable novel contextually meaningful discoveries.  This project is expected to produce novel bioinformatics algorithms and tools for comprehensive joint analysis of large scale genomics and connectomics data. The availability of these powerful methods and tools is critical for full knowledge discovery and exploitation of major connectomics and imaging genomics initiatives such as HCP and ADNI. In addition, they can also help enable new computational applications in many other biomedical research areas where integrative analysis of connectomics and genomics data are of interest. Via thorough test and evaluation on HCP and ADNI data, these methods and tools will be demonstrated to have considerable potential for a better understanding of the interplay between genes, brain connectivity and function, and thus be expected to impact biomedical research in general and benefit public health outcomes. Public Health Relevance (Narrative) Integrating human connectomics and brain imaging genomics offers enormous potential, allowing us to perform systems biology approaches of the brain to better understand the interplay between genes, brain connectivity, and phenotypic outcomes (e.g., cognition, behavior, disorder). This proposal seeks to develop novel bioinformatics methods and software tools for integrative study of human connectomics and brain imaging genomics. These methods and tools can be applied to: (1) study normal brain functions to impact biomedical research in general, and (2) study brain disorders to improve public health outcomes by facilitating diagnostic and therapeutic progress.",Integrative Bioinformatics Approaches to Human Brain Genomics and Connectomics,9482419,R01EB022574,"[""Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Beds ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Disorders ', ' behavioral disorder ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Cognition ', ' Communities ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Joints ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Mining ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Nervous system structure ', ' Neurologic Organ System ', ' Neurologic Body System ', ' Nervous System ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Phenotype ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Visualization ', ' Imagery ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' brain visualization ', ' Brain imaging ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' Evaluation ', ' Fiber ', ' insight ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Sample Size ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' interest ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' novel ', ' Graph ', ' white matter ', ' substantia alba ', ' Modality ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' Genomics ', ' Genetic Determinism ', ' genetic determinant ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Address ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Data ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' cost ', ' software systems ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Outcome ', ' Coupled ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' data acquisition ', ' public health relevance ', ' multimodality ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' genome-wide ', ' Knowledge Discovery ', ' Software Algorithm ', ' Algorithmic Tools ', ' Algorithmic Software ', ' Teaching Module ', ' Educational Module ', ' Education Module ', ' Learning Module ', ' learning outcome ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' phenotypic data ', ' full genome ', ' entire genome ', ' whole genome ', ' connectome ', ' genomic data ', ' tractography ', ' high dimensionality ', ' genetic architecture ', ' ']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2018,455772,PA-03,0.014863419206747639
"Measuring, Modeling and Controlling Heterogeneity ABSTRACT - Overall The overall goal of the Measuring, Modeling and Controlling Heterogeneity Center in the Cancer Systems  Biology Consortium (M2CH-CSBC Center) is to improve management of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) by developing systems level strategies to prevent the emergence of cancer subpopulations that are resistant to treatment. We postulate that heterogeneity arising from epigenomic instability intrinsic to cancer cells and  diverse signals from extrinsic microenvironments in which cancer cells reside are root causes of resistance. We will learn how intrinsic and extrinsic factors influence differentiation state, proliferation and therapeutic  response in TNBC through experimental manipulation and computational modeling of cancer cell lines, 3D  engineered multicellular systems, xenografts and clinical specimens. We will deploy single cell `omic and imaging technologies that allow quantitative assessment of molecular, cellular, and structural heterogeneity. We will interpret these data using computational models that define control networks and structures in heterogeneous systems as well as transitions between states of therapeutic resistance and sensitivity. This will be  accomplished in three related Projects and three Cores. Project 1 will focus on measuring and managing  resistance-associated heterogeneity intrinsic to cancer cells. Project 2 will focus on identifying resistance-associated  signals from the microenvironment and on mitigating effects from these signals on therapeutic response. Project 3 will apply spatial systems biology approaches to TNBC specimens and multicell type models thereof to  discover molecular control networks that influence how cell intrinsic plasticity and microenvironment signaling  alter therapeutic responses in complex tissues. All three Projects will include analysis of 5 core cell lines (HCC1143, HCC1599, MDA-MB-468, SUM149PT, and HCC1806), 5 patient derived cultures, and 6 FDA  approved, pathway-targeted drugs (afatinib, ruxolotinib, trametinib, BYL719, cabozantinib, and everolimus). The computational network discovery, data integration, spatial systems analysis and modeling approaches are the same in all Projects and serve to integrate the work of the overall M2CH-CSBC Center. Multiple integrative computational strategies are proposed to identify candidate heterogeneity control networks. These include analysis of existing genomic, epigenomic, pharmacologic response, and metabolomic characteristics of  primary tumors and models thereof. An Imaging Management and Analysis Core will provide infrastructure and image analytics that will enable efficient image data management, quantitative analysis of image features, and visualization of images and metadata generated using multiscale light and electron microscopy. An Outreach Core will make educational materials, experimental and computational tools and data available to the CSB Consortium, to the CSBC/PS-ON Coordinating Center and to the broader scientific community. An Administrative Core serves as the organization, integration, and evaluation hub of the M2CH-CSBC Center. Project narrative This Project will improve management of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) by understanding and managing heterogeneity arising from epigenomic instability intrinsic to cancer cells and from diverse signals from extrinsic microenvironments in which cancer cells reside.","Measuring, Modeling and Controlling Heterogeneity",9830174,U54CA209988,"['Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Communities ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' In Vitro ', ' Leadership ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Electron Microscopy ', ' Patients ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Periodicity ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Phenotype ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Proteins ', ' Reagent ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Stress ', ' Systems Analyses ', ' Systems Analysis ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Work ', ' Immunofluorescence ', ' Immunofluorescence Immunologic ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Custom ', ' Imagery ', ' Visualization ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Image Analysis ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Measurement ', ' Plant Roots ', ' root ', ' Cellular Structures ', ' Cell Structure ', ' Cell Components ', ' Therapeutic ', ' cancer cell ', ' Malignant Cell ', ' Specimen ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' light microscopy ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' 3D ', ' 3-D ', ' Xenograft procedure ', ' xeno-transplantation ', ' xeno-transplant ', ' Xenotransplantation ', ' Xenograft ', ' Heterologous Transplantation ', ' Heterograft ', ' SDZ RAD ', ' everolimus ', ' data management ', ' Primary Neoplasm ', ' Primary Tumor ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' outreach ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' bioimaging ', ' biomedical imaging ', ' bio-imaging ', ' Genomics ', ' Genomic Instability ', ' Genome Instability ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabolomics ', ' Microarray Analysis ', ' microarray technology ', ' microarray analyses ', ' Microarray-Based Analysis ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Data ', ' Educational Materials ', ' Breast Cancer Cell ', ' breast tumor cell ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' in vivo ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Clonal Expansion ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Metadata ', ' meta data ', ' triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma ', ' triple-negative breast cancer ', ' TNBC ', ' therapy resistant ', ' treatment resistance ', ' therapeutic resistance ', ' resistant to therapy ', ' resistance to therapy ', ' epigenomics ', ' image visualization ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' data integration ', ' Cancer cell line ', ' Imaging technology ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' analytical tool ', ' combinatorial ', ' Cell model ', ' Cellular model ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' open source ', ' network models ', ' tumor ', ' FDA approved ', ' treatment response ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted therapy ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' quantitative imaging ', ' MDA-MB-468 ', ' bioprinting ', ' bio-printing ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Infrastructure ', ' computational suite ', ' ']",NCI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,U54,2019,83652,OR-03,-0.06576344738903263
"New Jersey Alliance for Clinical Translational Science: NJ ACTS Coordinated by Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences (RBHS), the New Jersey Alliance for Clinical and Translational Science (NJ ACTS) comprises a consortium with Rutgers and Princeton Universities (PU), NJ Institute for Technology (NJIT), medical, nursing, dental and public health schools, hospitals, community health centers, outpatient practices, industry, policymakers and health information exchanges. All Alliance universities and affiliates have provided substantial resources and contributed to the planning, development and leadership of the consortium. With access to ~7 million people, NJ ACTS serves as a ‘natural laboratory’ for translational and clinical research. With a state population of ~9 million, New Jersey ranks 11th in the US, 1st in population density and higher than average in racial and ethnic diversity. Surprisingly, NJ has no CTSA Hub to coordinate translational and clinical research. Our CTSA Hub focuses on two overarching themes: the heterogeneity of disease pathogenesis and response to treatment, and the value of linking large clinical databases with interventional clinical investigations to identify cause-and-effect and predict therapeutic responses. NJ ACTS will provide: innovative approaches to link information from large databases and electronic health records to inform clinical trial design, execution and analysis; and novel platforms for biomarker discovery using fluorescence in situ hybridization and machine learning to identify unique neural signatures of chronic illness. NJ ACTS will access a large health system with significant member diversity; a rich legacy of community engagement and community-based research platforms; and proven approaches to enhance workforce development in clinical research. With a substantial investment in streamlining research administration and IRB practices at Rutgers and with the inception of NJ ACTS, there exists an unparalleled opportunity for logarithmic growth in clinical research in New Jersey. To build our capacity for participant and clinical interactions as a CTSA Hub, the newly established Trial Accelerator and Recruitment Office will coordinate feasibility assessment, implementation, recruitment, and evaluation of clinical studies. Additionally, our organization of five clinical research units into a cohesive network provides extraordinary expertise in strategic locations to enhance participant recruitment from diverse communities with a particular focus on: children; the elderly; those with serious mental illness or substance abuse issues; low-income individuals served by Medicaid; those with HIV/AIDS; and people of all ages who are minorities, underserved, and victims of health and environmental disparities. With a history of collaboration, partners and affiliates share unique skills, expertise, training and mentoring capabilities that will be greatly amplified within the infrastructure of a CTSA Hub. Princeton and NJIT, without medical schools or hospital affiliates, seeks collaboration with Rutgers to provide clinical research platforms; Rutgers seeks the PU and NJIT expertise in novel informatics platforms, expertise in natural language and ontology, machine learning and cognitive neurosciences. Together NJ ACTS will provide an alliance that will catalyze clinical research and training across New Jersey to improve population health and contribute to the CTSA Consortium. In this revised application, the overall themes remain unchanged but Cores leadership and direction has been markedly refined. Project Narrative The New Jersey Alliance for Clinical and Translational Science (NJ ACTS), as a member of the CTSA Consortium, unites Rutgers University, Princeton University, the New Jersey Institute of Technology, clinical, community and industry partners in a shared vision to make New Jersey a healthier state. Building on New Jersey’s already significant capabilities to promote and facilitate clinical and translational research, NJ ACTS will serve as a catalyst, inspiring new approaches to diagnose and manage disease, and fostering career development of the next generation of translational researchers, and promoting population health.",New Jersey Alliance for Clinical Translational Science: NJ

"Knowledge Management Center for Illuminating the Druggable Genome The main goal of the Knowledge Management Center (KMC) for the Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) program is to aggregate, update and articulate protein-centric data, information and knowledge for the entire human proteome with emphasis on understudied proteins from the 3 families that are the focus of the IDG (“IDG List”). The long-term objective of the KMC is to encourage and support biomedical research aimed at understudied proteins by providing an extensive resource of data, information, knowledge, methods and reagents for the entire human proteome, and to support the growing online community focused on understudied proteins. With focus on the IDG List and human proteins, the KMC will enable support for expanded coverage for non-human proteins of therapeutic interest and other associated human health data, in order to catalyze novel biomedical discoveries. To support the overall IDG objective, and to maintain, update and improve these integrated resources, the KMC draws upon expertise from multiple knowledge domains, specifically biology, chemistry and medicine, as well as computer science, graphic design and web programming. Specifically, for the Phase 2 of the IDG KMC we propose 4 Aims:1. Create an automated workflow that captures relevant public data for the entire proteome and manual annotations for the IDG list. The KMC knowledge management system will be built around knowledge graphs, focused on five major branches of the target knowledge tree, tkt: Genotype, Phenotype, Expression, Structure & Function, and Interactions & Pathways, respectively. Aim 2: Design, develop and implement a protein knowledgebase with Data Analytics support. Our protein-centric biomedical knowledge base, TCKB (Target Central Knowledgebase) will be comprised of the data, knowledge and information container, together with its codebase and software pipelines. TCKB will be the repository for experimental, processed and computed data and reagents originating from the IDG DRGCs (Data and Resource Generation Centers). We will provide informatics and modeling support for DRGC activities. Aim 3: We will expand, improve and maintain Pharos. Particularly “knowledge packages,” support automated data summaries for Protein Dossiers, and actively seek feedback from our community. Aim 4. Outreach to scientific community. We will support a series of activities that will leverage TCKB, Pharos and other IDG resources to increase adoption of IDG work, while observing FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) principles for our knowledgebase, portal and pipelines. The KMC will engage in community outreach by leading tutorials and feedback sessions and dissemination of the Pharos system. To meet its goals, the KMC will coordinate all core activities in close coordination with the IDG Steering Committee and IDG Project Scientists (PS), and include members of the IDG Consortium (IDG- C), other NIH Common Fund programs, NIH Commons, as well as other initiatives.

"Accelerating Multi-modal Biomarker Discovery in Translational Research with Cloud Data Integration Project Summary/Abstract Cytobank is the leading cloud-based platform for analysis and storage of single cell flow and mass cytometry data, technologies that are essential for investigating the interplay between the immune system and disease conditions including cancer. There are numerous data analysis steps between raw data and insight especially for many single-cell technologies, where the data analysis is complex, highly expert-driven and/or reliant on novel computational methodologies. Cytobank already makes major contributions (1) centralizing single-cell cytometry data, (2) providing data analysis traceability that removes knowledge sharing complexities, and (3) establishing a platform that increases access to cutting edge algorithms and makes complex machine learning methods easy for biologists to use. However, as the amount, complexity, and different types of single cell data and other associated data increases and the number of workflows and single-cell algorithms to analyze the data also increases, the need for open and easy access to existing and new tools and secure, complete storage of the workflows and the resulting data has increased to the point of being critical for supporting basic and translational research collaborations and enabling them to efficiently achieve their objectives including biomarker discovery and development. The proposed project significantly extends the capabilities of the Cytobank platform. This will benefit the community by (1) enabling scalable and secure access to a number of new single-cell data analysis tools that will result in new automated workflows, and (2) enable more efficient cross platform knowledge generation with increased meta-analysis capabilities across experiments and data types. The potential of this project is that thousands of scientists around the world will be able to more easily leverage additional single-cell cytometry, transcript, and other data in their translational research data analysis including automating analysis that has primarily been dominated by expert-driven annotation, thus providing a central repository and knowledge management framework that will accelerate biomarker discovery and precision medicine. Project Narrative Single-cell biology and Immunotherapy are exploding and generating larger and more complex datasets in combination clinical trials. To take full advantage of these revolutions, the iteration and dissemination of advanced single-cell data analysis algorithms (many of whose development was funded by the NIH) needs to scale at the same rate as single-cell data generation technologies are scaling, and multi-omics data analysis and visualization must be integrated and automated. This project will greatly accelerate scientific research, transparency, and reproducibility by significantly lowering the barrier to perform complex data analysis of multiple types of high-dimensional data, providing the biomedical research community with access to powerful tools needed in immuno-oncology, autoimmunity and other high-impact disease areas.",Accelerating Multi-modal Biomarker

Crohn's disease (CD) affects over 700,000 patients in the United States. Nearly 60% of CD patients require surgical resection for medically-unresponsive disease within 10 years of diagnosis. Frequently, patients present with deep bowel injury composed of both medically-responsive inflammatory and non- responsive fibrotic injury. Despite the presence of an inflammatory target, medical therapy may be futile and timely surgical management should be pursued. Further, strategies using early high-intensity immunosuppression to prevent future fibrostenotic disease are likely to over treat portions of the CD population. Therefore, therapeutic decisions are predicated on (1) the probability that existing disease activity will respond to medical therapy and (2) the probability of developing future fibrostenotic complications. Assessment using colonoscopy and surrogates of inflammation including imaging, blood, and stool-based biomarkers fail to provide comprehensive and quantitative assessments of bowel injury, including fibrosis. Despite its importance, there are no measures to account for deep bowel wall injury and intestinal fibrosis. This research proposal will utilize quantitative imaging findings of deep bowel injury in conjunction with blood-based biomarkers reflecting disease phenotypes to predict medical failure, defined as requiring future bowel resection, hospitalization, and prolonged steroid use. To achieve our imaging aims (Aim 1) we will use analytic morphomics, a computer image analysis method, to quantify body and bowel composition from over 4,000 CT-enterographies in a longitudinal 1200 patient CD cohort. In Aim 2, serum glycoproteome variance will be characterized in carefully phenotyped inflammatory and stricturing subjects to refine our preexisting biomarkers of fibrosis. We have demonstrated that variations of the serum glycoproteome reflect the degree of intestinal fibrosis present and expect that serum glycoproteomics can differentiate inflammatory from fibrotic phenotypes in CD. Optimized serum glycoproteome profiles will be used to predict future conversion from B1- inflammatory disease to B2/3 fibrostenotic disease in a pediatric prospective-inception cohort (RISK study). Aim 3 entails a prospective study combining analytic morphomics and serum glycoproteome profiles to predict therapeutic response and clinical outcomes; providing preliminary data for future R03/R01 studies. Dr. Stidham is a Lecturer of Medicine at the University of Michigan Division of Gastroenterology. He earned his medical degree from the University of Virginia (AOA), completed an internal medicine residency at the University of Pennsylvania, and was a T-32 research fellow at the University of Michigan (2011). His research background combines laboratory and clinical experience with Dr. Peter Higgins (primary mentor), focusing on novel biomarker development. Dr. Stidham has been awarded several prior grants for pilot work, including a MICHR-CTSA T32 Pilot Grant for Proteomics and a Crohn's and Colitis Foundation Career Development Award for ultrasound imaging research. He is in the process of completing a Masters program in Clinical Research Design and Statistical Analysis at the University of Michigan School of Public Health (matriculation in April 2015). He has published in several gastroenterology journals, presented research internationally, and has built the independent collaborations featured in this proposal. Central to this career development award, the candidate will leverage the expertise of several mentors and collaborators to develop deep foundational skillsets in analytic imaging, translational proteomics, bioinformatics, and machine learning methods. The University of Michigan houses a nationally recognized Inflammatory Bowel Disease Program, internationally recognized proteomics expertise, and a dedicated Analytic Morphomics Group focused on computational image analysis of organs. The mentored research training will be supplemented with focused graduate-level coursework in bioinformatics, medical image analysis, machine learning methodologies, and decision support systems provided through the University of Michigan Center for Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics and the School of Public Health. The Division of Gastroenterology and Department of Medicine have a history of strong support for Dr. Stidham and will provide the time, resources, and mentorship necessary to achieve his professional and research goals. The training provided through this career development award will be pivotal for the candidate's development as an independent translational investigator focused on individualizing therapeutic management. This research will provide the foundation for future collaborative studies to further develop these and other prognostic tools for the inflammatory bowel diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed work evaluates the capabilities of quantitative image analysis and serum glycoproteome profiles to predict the probability of medical response in Crohn's disease. Improved prediction of therapeutic response would tailor Crohn's disease management such that patients unlikely to benefit from medical therapy can proceed to timely surgical management and be spared

"C-PAC: A configurable, compute-optimized, cloud-enabled neuroimaging analysis software for reproducible translational and comparative ABSTRACT The BRAIN Initiative is designed to leverage sophisticated neuromodulation, electrophysiological recording, and macroscale neuroimaging techniques in human and non-human animal models in order to develop a multilevel understanding of human brain function. However, the necessary tools for organizing, processing and analyzing neuroimaging data generated through these efforts are not widely available as coherent and easy-to- use software packages. Gaps are particularly apparent for nonhuman data (i.e., monkey, rodent), as most of the existing processing and analytic software packages are specifically designed for human imaging. Methods have been proposed for addressing the challenges inherent to the processing of nonhuman data (e.g., brain extraction, tissue segmentation, spatial normalization, brain parcellation, temporal denoising); to date, these have not been readily integrated into an easy-to-use, robust, and reproducible analysis package. Similarly, many of the sophisticated machine learning and modeling methods developed for neuroimaging analyses are inaccessible to most researchers because they have not been integrated into easy-to-use pipeline software. As a result, translational and comparative neuroimaging researchers patch together neuroinformatics pipelines that use various combinations of disparate software packages and in-house code. We propose to extend the Configurable Pipeline for the Analysis of Connectomes (C-PAC) open-source software to provide robust and reproducible pipelines for functional and structural MRI data. We will integrate the various disparate image processing and analysis methods used to handle the challenges of nonhuman imaging data, into a single, open source, configurable, easy-to-use end-to-end analysis pipeline package that is accessible locally or via the cloud. The end product will not only improve the quality, transparency and reproducibility of nonhuman translational and comparative imaging, but also enable new avenues of scientific inquiry through our inclusion of methods that are yet to be applied to nonhuman imaging data (e.g., gradient- based cortical parcellation methods, hyperalignment). Specific aims of the proposed work include to: 1) Integrate neuroimaging processing and analysis methods optimized for BRAIN Initiative data, 2) Implement strategies for carrying out comparative studies of human and non-human populations, and 3) Extend C-PAC to include cutting-edge analytical strategies for identifying mechanisms of brain function. All development will occur “in the open” using GitHub and other collaborative tools to maximally involve participation in the C-PAC project. Annual hackathons will be held to collaborate with investigators from BRAIN Initiative awards and other neuroinformatics development projects to integrate their tools with C-PAC. Hands-on training will be held to train investigators on optimal use of the newly developed tools. NARRATIVE New neuroimaging analysis software is needed to process and analyze the various human and non-human neuroimaging data collected through the BRAIN Initiative. We will address this need by extending the already mature C-PAC human brain imaging data analysis pipeline to include support for animal data, with a particular focus on providing methods for conducting comparative studies between species. The proposed work will also include a toolbox for helping to align electrophysiological data that is commonly collected in non-human studies, with the brain imaging data.","C-PAC: A configurable, compute-optimized, cloud-enabled neuroimaging analysis software for reproducible translational and comparative",9766371,R24MH114806,"['Adoption ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Capital ', ' Communities ', ' Comparative Study ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Electrodes ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Environment ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Learning ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Maintenance ', ' Methods ', ' Monkeys ', ' Persons ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Phenotype ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodent ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Designing computer software ', ' Software Design ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Validity of Results ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' improved ', ' Image Analysis ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Pythons ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' animal data ', ' neuroregulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neural regulation ', ' neural control ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' High Performance Computing ', ' high-end computing ', ' Structure ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Readability ', ' Documentation ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' investigator training ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' Text ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' cost ', ' neuroinformatics ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' computing resources ', ' computational resources ', ' data structure ', ' open source ', ' graphical user interface ', ' graphic user interface ', ' Graphical interface ', ' comparative ', ' brain research ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' data sharing ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' cloud based ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' Scientific Inquiry ', ' hackathon ', ' hackfest ', ' hack day ', ' connectome ', ' software as a service ', ' human imaging ', ' innovative neurotechnologies ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' denoising ', ' de-noising ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' analysis pipeline ', ' ']",NIMH,"CHILD MIND INSTITUTE, INC.",R24,2019,545648,NY-12,0.0040528266251736176
"Spatial Genomics for in situ single cell expression analysis in the brain Summary Identifying the spatial organization of tissues at cellular resolution from single cell gene expression profiles is essential to understanding neurological systems. We have developed a spatial genomics approach that allows in situ 3D multiplexed imaging of many genes in single cells called sequential Fluorescence in situ hybridization (seqFISH). This technology can profile transcriptional states of single cells directly in their native tissue context with up to 249 genes multiplexed with single molecule sensitivity on each gene. We have demonstrated over 15,000 cells profiled in mouse brain slices. This SBIR project will be focused on the design, production and optimization of an instrument that allows hundreds of genes to be multiplexed and imaged in single cells within their native tissue context. The resulting machine will be commercially launched and targeted to imaging or sequencing cores at research institutions. We will design the hardware, code the control software, and build the prototype instrument. We will engineer the hardware component including automated fluidics and multiple camera imaging system with a parallel effort to develop software controls as well as integrated analysis tools. In phase II, we will beta-test the instrument, generate probe sets for gene panels targeting different brain samples, and receive valuable feedback from users and optimize our instrument design. Narrative A major challenge of the BRAIN initiative and international Human Cell Atlas project is to identifying distinct cell populations in the brain within their native spatial environment. Addressing this challenge is essential not only to fundamental biological questions of understanding how different cell types interact to form neural circuits, but also essential in investigating mechanisms of human diseases where small subpopulations of cells, such as microglial, play pivotal roles. We have developed an in situ 3D multiplexed imaging method called sequential Fluorescence in situ hybridization (seqFISH), that can profile transcriptional states of single cells directly in a mouse coronal section with up to 249 genes multiplexed in the hippocampus and the cortex (Shah et al., Neuron 2016, Frieda et al., Nature 2016). Delivering this technology as a robust platform that can be used by neuroscientists would enable breakthrough discoveries and treatment options. To make this technology available for a broad range of users and customers, this phase I SBIR project will be focused on the design, production and optimization of an instrument called seqFISH100 and the parallel development of the control software to operate the seqFISH100.",Spatial Genomics for in situ single cell expression analysis in the brain,9730606,R43MH115538,"['Adoption ', ' Algorithms ', ' Atlases ', ' Automation ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Feedback ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hippocampus ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' hypothalamic ', ' Hypothalamus ', ' Hypothalamic structure ', ' Institutes ', ' Methods ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' nerve cement ', ' Nonneuronal cell ', ' Non-neuronal cell ', ' Neuroglial Cells ', "" Kolliker's reticulum "", ' Glial Cells ', ' Glia ', ' Neuroglia ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Play ', ' Production ', ' Reagent ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' mRNA ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Work ', ' Custom ', ' Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization ', ' Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization ', ' FISH assay ', ' FISH analysis ', ' FISH Technique ', ' FISH Technic ', ' base ', ' Microscope ', ' Site ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Measurement ', ' Clinical Pathways ', ' Liquid substance ', ' liquid ', ' fluid ', ' Effector Cell ', ' Contracts ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' tool ', ' instrument ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' In Situ ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' 3D ', ' 3-D ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' neural circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' Sampling ', ' software development ', ' developing computer software ', ' develop software ', ' single molecule ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Genomics ', ' Manufacturer Name ', ' Manufacturer ', ' Drops ', ' Institution ', ' imaging method ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' Address ', ' DNA Sequencing Facility ', ' Sequencing Core ', ' International ', ' Resolution ', ' Slice ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' SBIR ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' genome wide association study ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' touchscreen ', ' touchscreen panel ', ' touch screen panel ', ' touch screen ', ' touch panel ', ' Visualization software ', ' visualization tool ', ' scale up ', ' Population ', ' user-friendly ', ' human disease ', ' fluorescence imaging ', ' fluorescent imaging ', ' prototype ', ' operation ', ' Genomic approach ', ' genomic strategy ', ' genomic effort ', ' data visualization ', ' BRAIN initiative ', ' imaging system ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' multiplexed\xa0imaging ', ' ']",NIMH,"SPATIAL GENOMICS, INC.",R43,2019,265936,CA-27,-0.02082518040279404

"Incorporating molecular network knowledge into predictive data-driven models Modern computational techniques based on machine-learning (ML) and, more recently, deep-learning (DL) are playing a critical role in realizing the precision medicine initiative. However, there is a critical need to systematically combine these powerful data-driven techniques with prior molecular network knowledge to make more accurate predictive models while also satisfactorily explaining their predictions in terms of mechanisms underlying complex traits and diseases. I propose to use domain specific knowledge from biology and computing to tackle three outstanding problems: 1) how to predict missing labels associated with millions of publicly available samples? 2) what molecular/cellular function can be attached to these samples and 3) how can we translate the findings from human data to a model species and back? ​Network-constrained Deep Learning for Metadata Imputation: ​​Most multifactorial phenotypes are tissue dependent and manifest differently depending on age, sex, and ethnicity. However, a majority of publicly-available genomic data lack these labels. I will develop a network-guided approach to predict missing metadata of samples based on their expression profiles by designing novel data-driven models where the model architecture and/or structure of the input data are constrained by an underlying gene network. ​Network-guided Functional Analysis of Genomic Data: ​​High-throughput experiments often generate lists of genes of interest that are hard to interpret. Functional enrichment analysis (FEA) is a powerful tool that attaches functional meaning to an experimental set of genes by summarizing them into sets of pathways/processes. However, standard FEA analysis is limited by incomplete knowledge of gene function, lack of context of the underlying gene network, and noise in expression data. I will address these limitations by developing a network-guided approach that jointly captures genes, their interactions, and their known biological pathways/processes into a common, low-dimensional space that facilitates deriving biological meaning by comparing the distance between the experimental gene set and the pathway/process of interest. ​Joint Multi-Species Genomic Data Analysis and Knowledge Transfer: ​​In particular, finding the optimal model system to use in a follow-up study based on genetic signatures derived from human experiments is challenging because genetic networks can be quite different from species to species. I propose to use data-driven models to embed heterogeneous networks comprised of human genes and model species genes into a common, low-dimensional space to better compare genetic signatures between two (or even multiple) species. I will apply these methods to three specific tasks, but I emphasize that the results of this study will be transferable to any other biological problem where complex gene/protein interactions are a major component. I have surrounded myself with a great support team and developed a strong professional development plan. The freedom and support provided by the F32 fellowship will be instrumental in achieving my goal of becoming a professor with an independent research group. This proposal aims to develop novel computational approaches that systematically combine prior molecular network knowledge, powerful data-driven computational techniques, and large transcriptome data collections to answer three critical questions in biomedicine: 1) how to predict missing labels associated with millions of publicly available samples? 2) what molecular/cellular function can be attached to these samples and 3) how can we translate the findings from human data to a model species and back? The core goal of my fellowship is to achieve this by infusing prior-knowledge into state-of-the-art data-driven statistical/machine learning methods so that we can overcome two major hurdles in studying complex, multifactorial traits and diseases: a) complex genetic interactions underlie multi-factorial traits and diseases, and b) these traits and diseases often differ in how they manifest from patient to patient.",Incorporating molecular network knowledge into predictive data-driven models,9835005,F32GM134595,"['Accounting ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Biology ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell physiology ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Collection ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Engineering ', ' Fellowship ', ' Followup Studies ', ' Follow-Up Studies ', ' Liberty ', ' Freedom ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Joints ', ' Methods ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Biological Models ', ' Modernization ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' Biological ', ' Development Plans ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' Genetic ', ' gene function ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' human data ', ' professor ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Gene Proteins ', ' Protein Gene Products ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' functional genomics ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' genetic association ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Computational Technique ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Metadata ', ' meta data ', ' disease phenotype ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' driving force ', ' mathematical sciences ', ' mathematic sciences ', ' math sciences ', ' Precision Medicine Initiative ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' transcriptome ', ' global transcription profile ', ' global gene expression ', ' genomic profiles ', ' genetic signature ', ' gene signatures ', ' data to knowledge ', ' data into knowledge ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic dataset ', ' genomic data-set ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' human model ', ' deep learning ', ' ']",NIGMS,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,F32,2019,61610,MI-08,-0.0005452962097113051

The massive database describes the characteristics of all 133 million persons who resided in the United States in 1940. The data have been available for only a brief period, but are already having a profound impact on scientific research. They are the primary data source for at least 19 sponsored projects, including nine funded by NIH and seven funded by NSF. Through May 2017, 104 investigators had produced 95 papers based on the data, including 22 articles, four books, three PhD dissertations, and 66 working papers. This project will improve the quality and usability of the database by correcting transcription errors; improving the coding, editing, and allocation of key variables; and introducing new data dissemination tools designed to simplify access to the data. The project will undertake three major activities to meet these objectives. 1. Incorporate new verified census information on name, age, sex, family relationship, race, marital status,  birthplace, and residence five years ago. 2. Improve coding, editing, and allocation for geographic variables, migration, occupation, and numerically-  coded variables such as income. 3. Apply new technologies to democratize access to the data through new data access tools and a virtual data  enclave for a restricted version of the data that contains names. This project is a highly cost-effective use of scarce resources to develop shared infrastructure for research, education, and policy-making on health and aging. The proposed improvement of data quality is urgent, and will provide a resource of unprecedented power for understanding the effects of public policies, social institutions, and environmental conditions on the health, well-being, and functioning of people, both over the life course and in their later years. Narrative This project will develop data for prospective analysis of the impact of early-life circumstances and environment on health outcomes in late life, including Alzheimer's disease. The proposed improvement of data quality is urgent, and will provide a resource of unprecedented power for understanding the effects of public policies, social institutions, and environmental conditions on the health, well-being, and functioning of people, both over the life course and in their later years.

"A BRAIN Initiative Resource: The Neuroscience Multi-omic Data Archive Project Summary The Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative promotes the development and application of technologies to describe the temporal and spatial dynamics of cell types and neural circuits in the brain. The Principal Investigator, senior personnel and staff of this project have diverse expertise required to marshall data across the BRAIN Initiative consortium, including experience in data collection from multiple institutions, large-scale quality control and analysis processing capability, familiarity with NIH policy and public archive deposition strategies. To promote smooth interactions across a large research consortium, we will develop the Neuroscience Multi-Omic Archive (NeMO Archive), a data repository that is specifically focused on the storage and dissemination of omic data from the BRAIN Initiative and related brain research projects. We will utilize a federated model for data storage such that the physical location of data can be distributed between the NeMO local file system, public repositories, and a cloud-based storage system (e.g. Amazon S3). We will leverage this capability and distribute BRAIN Initiative data between our local filesystem and the cloud. The Nemo Archive will be a data resource consistent with the principles advanced by research community members who are launching resources in next generation NIH data ecosystem. These practices include FAIR Principles, documentation of APIs, data-indexing systems, workflow sharing, use of shareable software pipelines and storage on cloud-based systems. The information incorporating into the NeMO archive will, in part, enable understanding of 1) genomic regions associated with brain abnormalities and disease; 2) transcription factor binding sites and other regulatory elements; 3) transcription activity; 4) levels of cytosine modification; and 5) histone modification profiles and chromatin accessibility. It will enable users to answer diverse questions of relevance to brain research, such as identifying diagnostic candidates, predicting prognosis, selecting treatments, and testing hypotheses. It will also provide the basic knowledge to guide the development and execution of predictive and machine learning algorithms in the future.

"Comprehensive but simple encoding of bioassays to accelerate translational drug discovery PROJECT SUMMARY Collaborative Drug Discovery, Inc. (CDD) proposes to extend its innovative software platform — BioAssay Express (BAE, version 1.0) — which helps biologists to quickly and easily encode their plain-text biological assay protocols into formats suitable for computational processing. In Phase 2B, CDD will further enhance BAE so that it can markup a bioassay with a comprehensive, detailed set of annotations that completely specifies the protocol, step by step. In its current state of development in Phase 2, BAE 1.0 enables scientists to summarize the English language text that specifies an experimental protocol, supplementing it with machine-interpretable descriptors. At the end of Phase 2B, BAE 2.0 will output a detailed machine- interpretable version that will be completely equivalent to, and can optionally substitute for, the traditional English language method description. The enhanced BAE 2.0 software will enable scientists engaged in early stage drug discovery to efficiently and accurately document experimental procedures and intelligently aggregate datasets across research groups. An important benefit will be facilitating improved access, use and reproducibility by (1) flagging differences between closely related assays; (2) correlating differences in protocols with differences in results; and (3) improving the reproducibility of experiments conducted in different laboratories, to highlight potential causes of divergences. The project will continue to leverage the related broad initiatives at NIH and elsewhere that are working to promote translational research, gather screening data via open repositories, and apply sophisticated ontologies to classify these datasets. Our project targets the intersection of these disparate initiatives and unifies them by making their complex standards and guidelines for praxis realistically accessible to researchers who want to focus on their scientific work To encourage adoption, the software will prioritize intuitive ease of use by scientists who are not informatics experts, harmonize with existing laboratory workflows, minimize the extra effort of annotation, integrate seamlessly into preclinical data management platforms (including but not limited to CDD’s own CDD Vault), and deliver clear and immediate benefits to the user as part of an integrated experience. This combination of new capabilities and extreme ease of use will accelerate translational drug discovery efforts by empowering software platforms that bridge the divide between biologists and medicinal chemists to apply sophisticated tools — long available on the chemistry side — for the first time also to the biological side, and thus across both domains. Existing software can already easily connect screening results to chemical structures. This new platform will further connect these data to the purpose and methodology of the screens. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will create novel computational tools that will help researchers to efficiently and accurately document experimental procedures, thereby facilitating improved access, use and reproducibility of data and assays. This fundamental capability ultimately accelerates translating new experimental discoveries into the development of novel and improved drugs against a wide range of diseases. These tools will particularly benefit networks of researchers working on diseases that leading pharmaceutical companies have largely ignored because they are not perceived as highly profitable opportunities, despite the fact that in many cases they afflict millions of people.",Comprehensive but simple encoding of bioassays to accelerate translational drug discovery,9608807,R44TR000185,"['Adoption ', ' Algorithms ', ' Awareness ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Chemistry ', ' Communities ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Government ', ' Incentives ', ' Industry ', ' Institutes ', ' Intelligence ', ' Laboratories ', ' Manuals ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Remote Operation (Robotics) ', ' Robotics ', ' Semantics ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Standardization ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Texas ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Guidelines ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Ensure ', ' Chemical Structure ', ' Training ', ' Intuition ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Policies ', ' Data Quality ', ' Collaborations ', ' Descriptor ', ' Letters ', ' tool ', ' scaffold ', ' scaffolding ', ' English Language ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Side ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' empowered ', ' data management ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' repository ', ' drug discovery ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Academia ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Retrieval ', ' Ontology ', ' Screening Result ', ' Translational Research ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Text ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Output ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' PubChem ', ' Instruction ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' biomedical ontology ', ' screening ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' robotic system ', ' ']",NCATS,"COLLABORATIVE DRUG DISCOVERY, INC.",R44,2019,754441,CA-14,-0.022238811559540776
"Development of mosaic mouse models of HCC for genetic interspecies inference DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a menace for human health for the lack of any effective treatment. HCC is usually the end result of chronic liver diseases associated with diverse risk factors. Furthermore, non- alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) induced HCC, which is projected to be the leading cause of new cases, remains poorly characterized. Although many mouse models of HCC have been developed, it is unclear how well they represent different subgroups of human HCCs. This research plan proposes to transform HCC animal modeling by establishing a novel in vivo platform to accurately replicate the somatic molecular profiles of human HCC in mice. To do this, three independent HCC mouse models will be exhaustively characterized through exome sequencing and gene expression profiling. Using bioinformatics techniques including machine- learning and network analysis, these datasets will be compared with human HCC datasets from TCGA and the ICGC to identify subgroups of patients with similar somatic molecular profiles to the HCC mouse models as well as refined minimum sets of characteristic genetic aberrations. A derived transposon system will be used to generate mosaic mouse models replicating human HCC genetic subgroups faithfully. These models will enable 1) experimental dissection of the molecular mechanisms underlying distinct etiologies of HCC, 2) systematic assessment of candidate HCC therapies and 3) investigation of therapeutic resistances. This K99/R00 career development award proposal describes a two-year mentored and three-year independent research program essential for the development of Dr. Font-Burgada as an independent investigator. Dr. Font-Burgada received his PhD at University of Barcelona, Spain, for the work he performed to investigate basic chromatin regulatory and epigenetic mechanisms. He then moved to University of California, San Diego where he joined Dr. Michael Karin's laboratory to train in mouse models of cancer and signal transduction. For the accomplishment of this research proposal, Dr. Font-Burgada has designed a strong training and career development plan consisting of: 1- the continued mentorship of Dr. Michael Karin to gain additional expertise in mouse models of HCC and signal transduction, 2- Training in bioinformatics, specifically in methods to identify cancer driver genetic aberrations and network-based approaches for comparative genomic analysis of mouse and human HCCs, to be overseen by co-mentor Dr. Hannah Carter, an Assistant Professor of Medicine, at UCSD. 3- Training in application of emerging transposon vector technologies to generate mosaic mouse models for in vivo analysis of oncogenic pathways. 4- Career development courses and seminars in a supportive academic environment in the Department of Pharmacology at UCSD to complement other aspects of the training program. This training plan will be overseen by an advisory committee comprising 4 members, mentor, co-mentor, and additional experts in mouse models of cancer and bioinformatics, Inder Verma and Trey Ideker, providing key scientific insights and essential guidance in critical steps in Dr. Font-Burgada transition to independence. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has a 5-year survival rate of less than 10% and leads to 700000 deaths globally each year. The genetic causes of this disease are poorly understood and the only available targeted therapy extends life expectancy by a mere 3 months. In order to improve these dismal statistics, I am developing a novel class of mouse models capable of reproducing the spectrum of mutations observed in a given human tumor, to enable study of HCC

"Turning a sequence barcode into a spectral barcode for single-cell analysis. Project Summary: The use of sequence barcodes has enabled high-throughput transcriptomic analysis of single cells. But one challenge remains – there is no method to map the physical assessments of single cells and the downstream transcriptomic data of single cells to the same cells of origin. This is because currently sequence barcodes are only read by sequencing which takes place after all single cells are lysed, reverse transcription is completed, and cDNA are amplified and pooled. In order to perform transcriptomic analysis and physical assessments on the same single cells, we will need a method that allows us to decipher the sequence barcodes while in the process of single-cell physical interrogation. Our goal in this proposed research is to develop a new method to turn sequence barcodes into spectral barcodes that can be read locally in the process. The proposed sequence- barcode-reading technique, if it can be realized, will have substantial impact to the single-cell community as it will become the only method to map the physical assessments and the downstream molecular analysis data to the same cells of origin in a high-throughput, streamlined format. Project Narrative: High-throughput single-cell analysis has advanced our knowledge in developmental biology and disease origins. But currently there is no method to map the physical and transcriptional analysis data of single cells to the same cells of origin.

"EMR-Linked Biobank for Translational Genomics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medical care informed by genomic information is beginning to move into clinical practice. The Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network through its initial phases has provided much of the groundwork for this transformation. The Geisinger Health System project, ""EMR-Linked Biobank for Translational Genomics"" intends to build on the knowledge and experience from eMERGE phase II to accelerate discovery and implementation while expanding our understanding of the sociocultural implications of genomics in medicine. We will accomplish this goal through three specific aims: 1) Use existing biospecimens, genotype and sequence data and EMR-generated phenotypes for discovery in the proposed disorders: familial hypercholesterolemia and chronic rhinosinusitis, 2) Develop and test approaches for implementation of genomic information in clinical practice, 3) Explore, develop and implement novel approaches for family-centered communication around clinically relevant genomic results. We currently have over 60,000 patients broadly consented for research with a large and increasing proportion consented for return of results and deposition in the electronic health record. Over 18,000 patients are genotyped on high density platforms. Our two proposed phenotypes, familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) were chosen because both conditions have a significant public health impact in the United States, but they are also ideally suited to the specific aims of the project. They provide opportunities for innovation and extension of current eMERGE methods. While many of these innovations will take advantage of the sequencing done as part of the project, there are several other areas emphasized in the funding opportunity that will broaden the scope of eMERGE research. One of the areas of emphasis for eMERGE III is exploring the familial return of actionable results. FH is well suited to this, as the current clinical recommendation is cascade testing of family members for all diagnosed patients. Currently this relies on the patient to contact at risk family members, but this is less than optimal. We will explore this issue using qualitative and quantitative methods and use the results to design and test novel family communication strategies. Gene-environment interactions play an important role in the development and severity of disease. These are very difficult to study. We propose novel approaches that leverage the assets of Geisinger Health System and the eMERGE Network to develop and apply methods to extend existing projects that study the impact of environment on CRS. This would include the first large scale environment-wide association studies (EWAS). Finally, we propose to lead efforts to apply the tools of economic modeling and analysis to eMERGE projects to begin to quantify the value of implementation of genomic medicine in the US healthcare system. These proposed innovations will magnify the already significant impact that the eMERGE program has had in moving genomic medicine from a dream to a reality.

"The Nomenclature of Human and Vertebrate Genes PROJECT SUMMARY - HGNC The core objective of the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) is to enable effective communication and data exchange between everyone with an interest in human genes, by providing a unique, concise and standardized gene symbol and name for every human gene. As usage of genomic data increases in healthcare the need for a consistent language for genes becomes ever more vital. Aim 1 of this proposal will ensure the continuity of standardized naming of novel human protein-coding genes, long and small non-protein-coding RNA (ncRNA) genes, and pseudogenes. In particular all putative novel protein coding loci will require careful consideration; as active members of the Consensus Coding Sequence (CCDS) consortium, HGNC can ensure that named loci accurately reflect the current expert manual annotations provided by consortium members. Aim 2 concentrates on renaming newly characterized human genes that are currently assigned a placeholder symbol; some genes with a phenotype-based nomenclature will also be considered for reassignment. These updates will reflect functional information, aid name transferal to orthologous genes, and avoid confusion. This round of revision will be a precursor to a nomenclature freeze for the majority of protein coding genes. Aim 3 focusses on coordinating gene naming across vertebrates, collaborating with the six existing vertebrate gene nomenclature committees (mouse, rat, chicken, Anolis, Xenopus, zebrafish) which base their naming on human gene nomenclature. As the Vertebrate Gene Nomenclature Committee (VGNC) this effort will be extended to naming genes in vertebrates lacking a nomenclature authority, such as cow, dog and horse. Recent gene naming in chimpanzee enabled creation of the necessary tools, pipelines and databases required for naming in other species. Assignments will reflect homologous relationships to human genes. Aim 4 will investigate the utility of machine learning in automated assignment of systematic nomenclature to long ncRNA genes and vertebrate orthologs, and potentially to pseudogenes. Models will be trained on manually curated datasets to learn both explicit and implicit practices, and then applied at scale. Aim 5 will ensure consistent naming across vertebrates in complex and divergent gene families, which can reveal some of the most interesting evolutionary biology and account for key diversity between species, but require careful manual curation. HGNC will collaborate with experts to expand the successful gene naming in the pharmacologically relevant cytochrome P450 (CYP) family to further species, also working across species on two other complex key families involved in detoxification, the glutathione S-transferases (GST) and UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs). HGNC will also work with experts to expand gene naming of olfactory receptors, the largest vertebrate gene family, from mammals to other well- studied model organisms such as zebrafish, Xenopus and chicken. HGNC is the only group worldwide providing systematic and user-friendly names for genes that are used throughout biomedical science and clinical practice; this is a crucial facility, with increasing importance and direct benefits for public health. To ensure effective communication between basic and clinical researchers, practicing clinicians and patients, there has to be a consistent well managed set of names for all human genes, which HGNC has provided since 1979. Having these names enables new discoveries, avoids confusion and prevents patient harm, by helping to ensure that everyone refers to a given gene using the same name.",The Nomenclature of Human and Vertebrate Genes,9727999,U24HG003345,"['Biology ', ' cow ', ' bovine ', ' bovid ', ' Bovine Species ', ' Cattle ', ' Gallus gallus domesticus ', ' Gallus gallus ', ' Gallus domesticus ', ' Chickens ', ' Communication ', ' Mental Confusion ', ' Confusional State ', ' Confusion ', ' P450 ', ' Cytochrome P450 Family Gene ', ' Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System ', ' Cytochrome P-450 ', ' Cytochrome P450 ', ' domestic dog ', ' canine ', ' Dogs Mammals ', ' Dogs ', ' Canine Species ', ' Canis familiaris ', ' Family ', ' Freezing ', ' Future ', ' Gene Duplication ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' glutathione aryltransferase ', ' glutathione aralkyltransferase ', ' S-Hydroxyalkyl Glutathione Lyase ', ' Ligandins ', ' Heme Transfer Protein ', ' Glutathione Transferase ', ' Glutathione S-Epoxidetransferase ', ' Glutathione S-Aryltransferase ', ' Glutathione S-Aralkyltransferase ', ' Glutathione S-Alkyltransferase ', ' Glutathione Organic Nitrate Ester Reductase ', ' EC 2.5.1.18 ', ' Glutathione S-Transferase ', ' Goals ', ' Horses ', ' Equus przewalskii ', ' Equine Species ', ' Equine ', ' Domestic Horse ', ' Equus caballus ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Language ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Mammalia ', ' Mammals ', ' Manuals ', ' detoxification ', ' Metabolism of Toxic Agents ', ' Metabolic Drug Detoxications ', ' Drug Metabolic Detoxification ', ' Drug Metabolic Detoxication ', ' Study models ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' Names ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Proteins ', ' Pseudogenes ', ' Public Health ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Publishing ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Rat ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Rattus ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA ', ' Science ', ' Standardization ', ' UDP Glucuronyl Transferase ', ' UDP Glucuronosyltransferase ', ' Glucuronyltransferase ', ' Glucuronic Transferase ', ' Glucuronosyltransferase ', ' vertebrata ', ' Vertebrate Animals ', ' Vertebrates ', ' Work ', ' clawed frog ', ' Xenopus sp.

"Omics data integration and analysis for structure-based multi-target drug design Abstract Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS), whole genome sequencing, and high-throughput techniques have generated vast amounts of diverse omics and phenotypic data. However, these sets of data have not yet been fully explored to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of drug discovery, which continues along the one- drug-one-gene paradigm. Consequently, the cost of bringing a drug to market is staggering, and the failure rate is daunting. Our long-term goal is to revive the lagging pharmaceutical pipeline by identifying robust methods for achieving precision medicine. We will achieve this goal by developing a novel structural systems pharmacology approach to drug discovery, which integrates structure-based drug design with heterogeneous omics data integration and analysis in the context of the whole human and pathogen genome and interactome. An increasing body of evidence from both our group and others suggests that most drugs commonly interact with multiple receptors (targets). Both strong and weak multiple drug-target interactions can collectively mediate drug efficacy, toxicity, and resistance through the conformational dynamics of biomolecules. In order to rationally design potent, safe, and precision medicine, we face one of the major unsolved challenges in structure-based drug design: what are all the possible proteins and their conformational states interacting with a drug in an organism? This proposal attempts to address this challenge by developing, disseminating, and experimentally testing novel computational tools. Based on our successful preliminary results, we will develop an integrated computational pipeline to identify three-dimensional (3D) protein-chemical interaction models in the cellular context and on a structural proteome scale. Specifically, we will develop a quaternary structure- centric multi-layered network model by integrating heterogeneous data from genomics, proteomics, and phenomics. We will develop a novel collaborative one-class collaborative filtering algorithm to infer missing relations in the multi-layered network. We will combine tools derived from structural bioinformatics, biophysics, and machine learning to gain biological insights into the drug action. To facilitate the usability and reproducibility of the proposed algorithms, we will develop community-based web resources established by our previous experiences in developing the Protein Data Bank (PDB). More importantly, we will work closely with experimental laboratories to test the proposed computational tools using targeted kinase polypharmacology as a real-world example, and iteratively improve the performance and usability of algorithm, software, and web services. The successful completion of this project will provide the scientific community with: (1) new methods to enhance the scope and capability of high-throughput screening for structure-based multi-target drug design; (2) a user-friendly web service to support community-based drug discovery; and (3) potential novel anti-cancer targeted therapeutics. Together, these tools will advance drug discovery and precision medicine by providing a structural systems pharmacology toolkit. Relevance Statement The pharmaceutical industry is in a dire state. Both the cost to launch a new drug and the attrition rate are increasing. Methods that can correlate drug-target interactions with clinical outcomes will reduce both the cost of drug development and mortality rates during clinical trials and treatments.",Omics data

"Organizational and Cultural Dynamics in Genomics Companies: Industry Engagement in Navigating Social and Ethical Issues This K99/R00 Award is designed to generate scholarship and interventions to guide genomics companies towards more just practices. It does so through a five-year training and research project, which investigates perspectives from members of the genomics industry, and leverages them to inform normative analyses and identify feasible paths towards concrete change. The project addresses issues of price, access and industrial control, with a focus on the ethics of profit and social responsibility. Through the proposed training program, the project prepares the candidate as an independent scholar whose research program links empirical and normative research with practical interventions to positively influence ethics and justice in private sector genomics. The first phase of research (conducted during the K phase, alongside training activities) is a comparative study examining social and cultural factors involved in perceptions of ethical issues among members of industry. The comparative study focuses on three biotech hubs in the US (the Bay Area, San Diego, and Boston), as well as an additional site in South Africa (Cape Town). The South African site helps place investigation of the US industry in light of a shifting global industry, and especially South Africa’s policy focus on genomics for population health (as well as its role in the H3Africa initiative). The study also considers industry subsector and individual company culture, in examining influences on industry approaches to social and ethical issues. During its R phase, the project then involves a systematic normative analysis of profit and social obligation in the genomics industry, based on key theories from bioethics and business ethics. The project will then feed this scholarly analysis back to industry stakeholders; using a Delphi study, it allows members of industry to use results of the normative analysis in strategizing interventions with the greatest likelihood of influencing the genomics industry in ethically desirable ways. This project addresses the NHGRI ELSI research priorities of genomic equity and social justice, as well as genomics and public health. Its career development plan focuses on training in normative analysis and Delphi methods, as well as content training in genomics and entrepreneurship. The training will be conducted at Johns Hopkins University, where the school’s preeminent bioethics center houses world experts in qualitative and quantitative empirical bioethics, alongside the University’s leading research and training in the biomedical sciences and their application in industry. The integrated research and training plan will prepare the candidate as an independent ELSI scholar with a rigorous research program focused on empirical and normative analysis of the business of biomedicine and genomics, and engagement with industry stakeholders. This Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00) investigates and leverages perspectives from members of the health-related private sector genomics industry, to develop guidance for improving approaches to social and ethical issues in the industry. It does so through in-depth qualitative analysis (interviews, cases studies, comparative analysis), scholarly normative analysis (drawing on theories from bioethics and business ethics), and a Delphi process of iterative questionnaires with industry stakeholders, aimed at strategizing concrete change regarding social obligations of the industry.

"Improving the efficiency of randomized trials of behavioral interventions for acute and chronic respiratory failure The goal of this Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research is to enhance the ability of Dr. Scott Halpern to mentor students, residents, post-doctoral fellows, and junior faculty in developing and testing behavioral economic interventions to prevent and improve outcomes following, acute and chronic respiratory failure. Patients with many forms of acute and chronic respiratory failure, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), respectively, are at high risk of death and suffer considerable short- and long-term impairments in quality of life and functioning. Behavioral interventions, including those informed by behavioral economic principles, hold great promise for preventing these conditions and improving outcomes. Yet the knowledge produced by randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of such interventions is limited due to impediments to patient accrual, patient-centered outcomes ascertainment, and the abilities of traditional analyses to determine which interventions work best for which patients. By leveraging the conceptual models, research infrastructures, and data collected in 5 of Dr. Halpern's ongoing or recently completed RCTs including 40,000 patients, Dr. Halpern and his mentees will develop and test ways to surmount each of these three barriers to producing greater knowledge on how to prevent and treat acute and chronic respiratory failure. First, they will conduct randomized trials of “nudges” to improve enrollment and retention in real RCTs. Second, they will learn and apply state-of-the-art natural language processing and machine learning techniques to enhance the ability to extract patient-centered outcomes from electronic health records, thereby identifying more efficient methods for outcome ascertainment in large, pragmatic RCTs. Third, they will learn and apply modern methods in causal inference and the detection of heterogeneous treatment effects to better understand how effective behavioral interventions are overall, how efficacious they would be if more patients adhered to them, and which interventions work best for which patients. These scientific aims will be completed within the context of a structured training program designed to improve Dr. Halpern's skills in mentoring junior patient-oriented researchers. Dr. Halpern has already successfully mentored more than two dozen patient-oriented researchers. However, by enabling him to reduce his clinical and administrative commitments, this award will increase the time he commits to mentoring, and will improve his mentoring skills by supporting didactic training in influence and leadership and “mentor-the-mentor” meetings with more senior mentors. The award will also enable him to develop a “Junior Faculty Visiting Professor Program in Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine,” thereby enhancing opportunities for his and other established investigators' mentees to network with other leaders in the field, receive external feedback and mentorship, and gain the confidence that comes with speaking to less familiar audiences. NARRATIVE Randomized clinical trials of behavioral interventions are essential to the prevention and treatment of acute and chronic respiratory failure. However, the efficiency of such trials, defined as the knowledge gained divided by the costs of completing the trials, is often quite low due to impediments to patient accrual, patient-centered outcome ascertainment, and the abilities of traditional analytic approaches to determine which interventions work best for which patients. This mid-career investigator award in patient-oriented research will develop and test methods to surmount these three barriers in the context of a multifaceted training program that will make the Principal Investigator a more effective mentor and team leader.",Improving the efficiency of randomized trials of behavioral interventions for acute and chronic respiratory

In line with the stated goals of the HuBMAP consortium to develop both “High-sensitivity, high-resolution imaging techniques that can rapidly provide spectral data over large areas of tissue” and “Quantitative imaging analysis tools, including automated 3D image segmentation, feature extraction, and image annotation,” the work outlined here will create a standardized, high throughput, and user-friendly workflow for using MIBI-TOF in basic and translational research to gain insight into how single cell phenotype and tissue structure are functionally-linked in health and disease. To achieve this, we will validate 100 FFPE antibodies and optimize ready-to-use multiplexed staining panels in lyophilized format that will permit storage for at least two years. Protocols and reagents for multiplexed signal amplification of protein and mRNA targets will be further refined, while next generation instrumentation will increase sample throughput to permit full tissue section imaging of up to 40 proteins in 1 hour. Standardized reagents and more robust instrumentation will be accompanied by an automated computational pipeline that utilizes a standard set of segmentation markers and machine learning to accurately identify nuclei and cell borders in any non-neural human tissue. This data will be used to cluster single cell events into functionally distinct populations according to morphology, protein expression, and histological distribution. The reagents and computational pipeline proposed here synergize with existing HuBMAP-funded platforms and could be readily generalized to virtually any high dimensional imaging modality. Thus, this work will not only provide a practical, back compatible imaging platform for high throughput multiplexed imaging, but will also accelerate development of other complimentary imaging technologies as well. Project Narrative Multiplexed ion beam imaging by time of flight (MIBI-TOF) is a new technology for visualizing dozens of proteins in standard clinical tissue biopsies at high resolution. The work outlined here will create a standardized, high throughput, and user-friendly workflow for using MIBI-TOF in basic and translational research to gain insight into how single cell phenotype and tissue structure are functionally-linked in health and disease.","A robust platform for multiplexed, subcellular proteomic imaging in human tissue",9894465,UH3CA246633,"['Antibodies ', ' Archives ', ' Atlases ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Biopsy ', ' Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma ', ' Non-Invasive Intraductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Invasive Ductal Carcinoma of the Breast ', ' Non-Invasive Ductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Intraductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Intraductal Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Ductal Carcinoma of the Breast ', ' Non-Infiltrating Ductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Intraductal Carcinoma of the Breast ', ' Intraductal Carcinoma ', ' Ductal Carcinoma In Situ ', ' Ductal Breast Carcinoma In Situ ', ' DCIS ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Communities ', ' Decidua Graviditas ', ' Decidua ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Equipment ', ' Feedback ', ' Foundations ', ' Lyophilization ', ' Freeze Dryings ', ' Freeze Drying ', ' Goals ', ' Granulomatous Lesion ', ' Granuloma ', ' Health ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hippocampus ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' immune suppression ', ' Immunosuppressive Effect ', ' Immunosuppression Effect ', ' Immunosuppression ', ' Institutes ', ' instrumentation ', ' Ions ', ' Metals ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' optical ', ' Optics ', ' Pathology ', ' Peer Review ', ' Phenotype ', ' First Trimester ', ' Early Placental Phase ', ' 1st trimester ', ' First Pregnancy Trimester ', ' Proteins ', ' Reagent ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' mRNA ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Staining method ', ' Stains ', ' Standardization ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Pulmonary TB ', ' Lung Tuberculosis ', ' Lung TB ', ' Pulmonary Tuberculosis ', ' Work ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Tissue Embedding ', ' Paraffin Embedding ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Organ ', ' Image Analysis ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Histologic ', ' Histologically ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Spectrometry, Mass, Secondary Ion ', ' Spectroscopy, Mass, Secondary Ion ', ' Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy Microscopy ', ' Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry Microscopy ', ' SIMS Microscopy ', ' Funding ', ' cancer immunotherapy ', ' immunotherapy of cancer ', ' immunotherapy for cancer ', ' anticancer immunotherapy ', ' anti-cancer immunotherapy ', ' Letters ', ' Morphology ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' Immune ', ' Immunes ', ' human tissue ', ' Event ', ' Scanning ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Medical center ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' Allergic ', ' Sampling ', ' Proteomics ', ' Formalin ', ' protein expression ', ' 3D images ', ' 3D image ', ' 3-D image ', ' 3-D Images ', ' Three-Dimensional Image ', ' imaging method ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' reagent standardization ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Resolution ', ' Extramural Activities ', ' Extramural ', ' EXTMR ', ' Translational Research ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' technology validation ', ' technology implementation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' tumor microenvironment ', ' cancer microenvironment ', ' ion source ', ' virtual ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' Imaging technology ', ' Population ', ' imaging Segmentation ', ' user-friendly ', ' graphical user interface ', ' graphic user interface ', ' Graphical interface ', ' Cloud Computing ', ' cloud computer ', ' Cloud Infrastructure ', ' quantitative imaging ', ' imaging platform ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' high resolution imaging ', ' human imaging ', ' high dimensionality ', ' Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging ', ' multiplexed\xa0imaging ', ' computational platform ', ' computing platform ', ' ']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,UH3,2019,590000,CA-18,-0.008539487798986323
"Integrating multidimensional genomic data to discover clinically-relevant predictive models The goal of this NIH Pathway to Independence award is to provide Dr. Brittany Lasseigne with an extensive training program to prepare her to be an effective independent investigator who uses computational genomics to study complex human diseases. We propose a formal one-year training and mentoring program in genomics, computer science, statistics, and career development to build on her 8+ years of hands-on training, followed by a three-year structured and independent research program. Research will focus on the integration of multidimensional genomic data sets in the context of complex human diseases. A critical barrier in genomic research is the complexity of data integration: the ability to leverage overlapping and unique information captured by different genomic assays would improve our understanding of data integration and generate clinically relevant genomic signatures. To meet this need, we propose to integrate a combination of genomic data we generated with public data to (1) infer genomic instability signatures from different data types, (2) improve clinically relevant phenotype prediction by building multi-omics machine learning classifiers and reducing phenotype heterogeneity, and (3) create a cloud-enabled R package and associated Shiny application to accelerate future research. The proposed work will advance our understanding of data integration, allow inference of genomic instabilities across data sets, and generate high performance classifiers for assessing clinically relevant phenotypes in both cancer and psychiatric disease using frameworks that will be broadly applicable across other complex diseases. It will also facilitate prioritization of experiments in future studies by informing on the orthogonality of genomic assays, thereby allowing more efficient study designs to capture as much information as possible within a given sample size or scope of experimentation. Collectively, this additional training will allow Dr. Lasseigne to develop new multidimensional data integration approaches and translational questions applicable across complex diseases when independent. Dr. Richard Myers (HudsonAlpha) and Dr. Gregory Cooper (HudsonAlpha), leaders in applying genetics and genomics to complex human diseases, and an Advisory Committee of additional experts including Dr. Barbara Wold (Caltech), Dr. Eddy Yang (UAB), and Dr. Timothy Reddy (Duke), will provide mentoring throughout this award. The mentored phase will take place at the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology, an ideal environment for this training with extensive translational science collaborations, expert faculty and staff, and state-of-the art computational and laboratory resources devoted to genomics. This combination will maximize Dr. Lasseigne's training program, facilitating her transition to an independent, tenure-track investigator at a university with a strong commitment to data-driven approaches to complex human disease research, i.e. strong genomics research programs with clinical collaborators, ideally at, or affiliated with, an academic medical center. Project Narrative The major outcome of this project will be a scientist with the necessary research, mentoring, teaching, and career development training to run an independent research program in computational genomics. The research proposed will apply novel strategies to further develop integrative machine learning analyses of multidimensional genomic data, discover clinically relevant predictive models, and create computational tools to accelerate future research.",Integrating multidimensional genomic data to discover clinically-relevant predictive models,9901758,R00HG009678,"['Academic Medical Centers ', ' University Medical Centers ', ' Award ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biotechnology ', ' Biotech ', ' Budgets ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Chromosomes ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Environment ', ' Faculty ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Institutes ', ' Laboratories ', ' Mentors ', ' Methodology ', ' Methylation ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' Phenotype ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Running ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Standardization ', ' statistics ', ' Teaching ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Testing ', ' Training Programs ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' promotor ', ' promoter ', ' Yang ', ' Lasso ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' Imagery ', ' Visualization ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Sample Size ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' programs ', ' Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure ', ' cancer chemotherapy ', ' Quimioterapia ', ' Combination Chemotherapy Regimen ', ' Chemotherapy, Cancer, General ', ' Chemotherapy Regimen ', ' Chemotherapy Protocol ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' Cell Proliferation ', ' Cellular Proliferation ', ' Cell Multiplication ', ' Cell Growth in Number ', ' Performance ', ' computer science ', ' Structure ', ' Gene Proteins ', ' Protein Gene Products ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' Genomics ', ' Genomic Instability ', ' Genome Instability ', ' Microsatellite Instability ', ' MicroRNAs ', ' miRNAs ', ' miRNA ', ' Micro RNA ', ' Chromosome Instability ', ' Chromosomal Instability ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Copy Number Polymorphism ', ' copy number variation ', ' copy number variant ', ' CpG Island Methylator Phenotype ', ' CIMP ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' molecular signature ', ' molecular profile ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Translational Research ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' protein metabolite ', ' Instruction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' data integration ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' Outcome ', ' Coupling ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' Bioconductor ', ' human disease ', ' data reduction ', ' single cell sequencing ', ' tenure track ', ' tenure process ', ' multiple omics ', ' multiomics ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic dataset ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic signature ', ' genomic classifier ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' biomarker performance ', ' biomarker utility ', ' multidimensional data ', ' high dimensional data ', ' ']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R00,2019,249000,AL-07,0.031555263478326635
"In situ transcriptome profiling in single cells Summary We have recently developed intron seqFISH (sequential Fluorescence in situ hybridization) to multiplex 10,421 genes directly in single cells. We showed that the 10,421 gene nascent transcriptome profile can identify cell types as well as capture the trajectory of the cells. We further demonstrated that we can perform mRNA seqFISH as well as immunostaining in the same cells following the 10,421 gene intron seqFISH measurement. We propose to develop this technology as a potential alternative approach to single cell RNAseq for the HuBMAP to characterize cell types directly in situ in tissues. In particular, we will adept in situ amplification methods such as hybridization chain reaction (HCR) to intron seqFISH. We had previously shown that mRNA seqFISH with HCR amplification performs exceptionally in tissues in overcoming autofluorescence background and enable robust decoding seqFISH barcodes. We will validate the integrated intron and mRNA seqFISH protocol in the mouse hippocampus in the UG3 phase of the project. Also in UG3 phase, we will develop computational tools to integrate intron seqFISH data with mRNA seqFISH as well as single cell RNAseq data. In the UH3 phase, we will translate the technology to human tissues, with a focus on human mammary tissues provided by Dr. Seewaldt at City of Hope. We will also work with the tissue mapping centers in the HuBMAP program to accelerate the translation of this technology to many tissue types. In the UH3 phase, we will generate million cell spatial atlas of human tissues containing intron profiles, mRNA profiles and protein abundances in each single cell. We will further develop computational tools to analyze for spatial enrichment of genes in the tissue and generate a pseudotime of developmental trajectories using the nascent transcriptome data. Taken together, we will develop a high throughput in situ imaging based platform to characterize cell types and future trajectories of cells using intron and mRNA seqFISH technologies. Narrative Transcriptome profiling in situ at the single cell level has transformative potential for understanding healthy versus diseased tissues in the human body. We propose an integrative approach profiling the nascent transcriptome as well as hundreds of mature transcripts in single cells in tissues. We will generate million cell spatial atlas for the mouse hippocampus as well as the human mammary tissue. We will gain unprecedented insight into the developmental of neurons in the brain as well as the duct cells in the breast. At the same time we will develop the computational tools to analyze the spatial genomics data.",In situ transcriptome profiling in single cells,9791198,UG3HL145609,"['Algorithms ', ' Animals ', ' Atlases ', ' Biology ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Breast ', ' Cell Differentiation ', ' Cell Differentiation process ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Cities ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Epithelium Part ', ' Epithelium ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hippocampus ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Intervening Sequences ', ' Introns ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' nerve cement ', ' Nonneuronal cell ', ' Non-neuronal cell ', ' Neuroglial Cells ', "" Kolliker's reticulum "", ' Glial Cells ', ' Glia ', ' Neuroglia ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' Play ', ' Proteins ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Publishing ', ' regenerate ', ' Regeneration ', ' Natural regeneration ', ' mRNA ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Staining method ', ' Stains ', ' Standardization ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Immunofluorescence ', ' Immunofluorescence Immunologic ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' dentate gyrus ', ' Gyrus Dentatus ', ' Fascia Dentata ', ' Dentate Fascia ', ' Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization ', ' Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization ', ' FISH assay ', ' FISH analysis ', ' FISH Technique ', ' FISH Technic ', ' base ', ' Image Analysis ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Phase ', ' insight ', ' Data Quality ', ' Measurement ', ' Human body ', ' Human Figure ', ' Letters ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' human tissue ', ' Radial ', ' Radius ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Reaction ', ' In Situ ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' granule cell ', ' mammary epithelium ', ' breast epithelium ', ' internal control ', ' Biopsy Specimen ', ' Biopsy Sample ', ' Speed ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' single molecule ', ' Mammary gland ', ' mammary ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' Data ', ' Ductal Epithelial Cell ', ' Ductal Cell ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Nuclear Structure ', ' Slice ', ' Transcript ', ' Validation ', ' Mammary Gland Parenchyma ', ' Mammary Gland Tissue ', ' Breast Tissue ', ' Process ', ' sample fixation ', ' Fixation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' markov model ', ' scale up ', ' combinatorial ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' imaging system ', ' transcriptome ', ' global transcription profile ', ' global gene expression ', ' Tissue imaging ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic dataset ', ' genomic data-set ', ' in situ imaging ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' ']",NHLBI,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,UG3,2019,375000,CA-27,-0.003954741377937296
"Integrative Biology Approach to Identify and Characterize Roles of lncRNAs Associated with Psoriasis Pathology PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Candidate After the completion of my Ph.D. in Bioinformatics, I joined the Center for Statistical Genetics at the University of Michigan (U-M) as research fellow and acquired extensive training in analysis on high- dimensional biological data. I uncovered a strong interest in studying the genetics and genomics of psoriasis when working with Dr. James Elder at the U-M, and I developed a fascination in understanding the functional roles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in cutaneous diseases. I joined the Department of Dermatology at the U-M as a faculty in summer of 2015, with secondary appointments in the Department of Computational Medicine & Bioinformatics and the Department of Biostatistics. In addition, I direct the new Center for Cutaneous Bioinformatics within the Department of Dermatology, and serve to supervise and implement an analysis pipeline for studies investigating the immunological mechanisms for different skin diseases. Career Development Plan I aim to become a future leader in combining in silico discovery and bench experiments to advance biomedical research in autoimmune skin disorders. My objective in seeking a Mentored Research Scientist Development Award is to acquire the additional knowledge, training, and experience necessary for me to become an independent scholar in developing novel systems biology approaches to decipher the pathology and mechanisms of cutaneous diseases. The five year training proposed will provide knowledge and experience in aspects that are critical to my success, and they are: i) To develop knowledge and experimental skills in cutaneous biology --- achieved by guidance from Dr. Elder (investigative dermatology), intense research meetings/conferences, and practical laboratory experience in cutaneous research; ii) To develop knowledge and skills to study immunological systems of autoimmune skin diseases --- achieved by supervision from Dr. Johann Gudjonsson (skin immunology), attending formal Immunology courses and seminars, and earning laboratory experience from immunology experiments; iii) To advance skills in developing statistical and computational approaches --- accomplished by mentoring from Dr. Goncalo Abecasis (computational biologist), research meetings, and conducting research projects requiring advanced skills and knowledge in quantitative science; iv) To cultivate my professional development through enhancing scientific connections, grantsmanship skills, and educator portfolio --- achieved by establishing connections with colleagues during meetings, visiting King’s College London as scholar, attending a grantsmanship workshop and bootcamp, and learning mentoring skills through teaching formal classes and mentoring research students. Through the intensive and comprehensive training, I will be well grounded in conducting basic science experiments and also be able to capitalize my advanced knowledge in quantitative science to model mechanisms in cutaneous diseases. Research Project The research project will use psoriasis as a disease model to study the roles of lncRNAs in complex cutaneous disorders. I will test the hypotheses that (i): some lncRNAs are key causal elements and potentiate pathogenic inflammatory reactions in psoriasis development and (ii) by combining in silico predictions and in vitro validations we are able to provide comprehensive characterization of skin-expressing lncRNAs in keratinocytes and lymphocytes to infer their pathological implications for psoriasis. This work will demonstrate how we can take advantages of the genomic data to develop an integrative biology framework to provide novel biological insights and understand pathological roles of lncRNAs. Significance Psoriasis is a chronic immune-mediated skin disease with complex genetic architecture. It is estimated that over 4 million Americans and 100 million people worldwide suffer from this disease. While genetic association studies have revealed the disease loci are highly enriched in non-coding regions, it is very challenging to translate genetic signals to biologic effects. In fact, most of the causal genes have not yet been identified. Our preliminary results showed that lncRNA is a class of gene that has largely been understudied for their roles in psoriasis, and both genetic and transcriptomic data suggested they can play important functions in psoriasis pathogenesis. By combining in silico analysis and in vitro validation we can expand our knowledge of lncRNAs in skin biology, and generate important hypotheses for future experiments. The results of this project can also identify novel biomarkers, and ultimately assist in the therapeutic drug discovery.

"Developing a mechanistic neurobiological model of exposure therapy response based on fear extinction theory Project Summary I am applying for a Mentored Patient-Oriented Career Development Award (K23) to support my development into an independently funded translational clinical psychologist. My long-term career goal is to conduct a program of research that translates neurobiological models of anxiety and its treatment into guidance for real- life clinical decision-making. Currently, although exposure therapy is the best available treatment for anxiety disorders, 25% of patients do not respond to an adequate course of exposure therapy and we do not know why. A critical long-term goal is to improve exposure therapy response by tailoring therapy based on the neurobiological profile of each patient. Because the mechanism of exposure therapy is thought to be extinction learning, the proposed research aims to address this goal by directly linking exposure therapy response to extinction learning in a sample of adults with social anxiety disorder. Specifically, I aim to identify neurobiological features of extinction learning that predict successful recall, are associated with clinical symptoms, and predict therapy response. The project will use a paradigm that I developed and piloted to assess physiological and neuroimaging measures of extinction learning. The expected outcomes are an innovative mechanistic neurobiological model that can identify patients at risk of non-response, as well as specific, testable hypotheses for how to improve outcomes for these patients. In order for this project, and my broader career goals, to succeed, it is imperative that I have expertise related to exposure therapy, predictive modeling, analysis of self-report, physiological, and fMRI data, and traditional and biomarker-guided clinical trial designs. I already have expertise in the theory and implementation of exposure therapy, as well as the analysis of self-report and fMRI data. This K23 award would allow me to receive advanced training in (1) machine learning techniques for building and evaluating clinically relevant predictive models, (2) specific skills for analysis and interpretation of physiological data, and (3) traditional and biomarker-guided clinical trials. I have assembled an inter-disciplinary team of mentors at Stanford University that are ideally suited to guide my research and training. Dr. Leanne Williams (primary mentor, Department of Psychiatry) will provide expertise on using neurobiology to make treatment outcome predictions, and provide overall career development mentorship throughout the project. Dr. James Gross (co-mentor, Department of Psychology) will provide expertise on physiological data and its integration with self-report and fMRI data. Dr. Tze Lai (co-mentor, Department of Statistics) will provide expertise on predictive models and biomarker-guided clinical trial designs. The training and associated research will take place in the Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences Department at Stanford University, a world renowned hub of neuroscience and psychiatry research, and at Stanford's Center for Cognitive and Neurobiological Imaging, a state-of-the-art neuroimaging facility. Project Narrative Social anxiety disorder affects as many as 12% of Americans, resulting in significant distress and disability. Although exposure therapy is one of the best treatments available, as many as 25% of patients do not respond and we do not know why. Extinction learning is thought to be the mechanism of exposure therapy, and the neuroscience of extinction learning has advanced significantly since exposure therapy was developed; however, there has been little application towards improved clinical outcomes. This project aims to improve exposure therapy response for patients with social anxiety disorder by directly linking exposure therapy response to the neurobiology of extinction learning.",Developing a mechanistic neurobiological model of exposure therapy response based on fear extinction theory,9675335,K23MH113708,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdala ', ' Animals ', ' Anxiety ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' behavioral extinction ', ' Extinction ', ' Extinction (Psychology) ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' Future ', ' skin conductance ', ' Skin Electric Conductance ', ' Psychogalvanic Reflex ', ' Electrodermal Response ', ' Galvanic Skin Response ', ' Goals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Laboratories ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurobiology ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Physiology ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Psychologist ', ' Psychology ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' statistics ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' waitlist ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Mediating ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Loudness ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Anterior ', ' Dorsal ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Distress ', ' learning extinction ', ' Funding ', ' Functional disorder ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Exposure to ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Severities ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Techniques ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' American ', ' cingulate cortex ', ' skills ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' K23 Program ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Award ', ' Prediction of Response to Therapy ', ' treatment response prediction ', ' treatment prediction ', ' therapy prediction ', ' predict treatment response ', ' predict therapy response ', ' predict therapeutic response ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Research Training ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' Cognitive ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Scientific Advances and Accomplishments ', ' scientific advances ', ' scientific accomplishments ', ' Translational Research ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' individualized medicine ', ' unique treatment ', ' tailored treatment ', ' tailored therapy ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' individualized treatment ', ' individualized therapy ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' customized treatment ', ' customized therapy ', ' predictive marker ', ' predictive molecular biomarker ', ' predictive biomarkers ', ' anxiety symptoms ', ' anxious symptom ', ' social anxiety ', ' Social Anxiety Disorder ', ' treatment of anxiety disorders ', ' anxious individuals ', ' anxious ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' improved outcome ', ' recruit ', ' patient response ', ' responsive patient ', ' ']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K23,2019,186408,CA-18,-0.013298024673205133
"Accelerating the diagnosis of bipolar disorder using genetic and phenotypic signatures PROJECT SUMMARY The diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder (BPD), a heritable disorder characterized by periods of depression and mania, is extremely challenging in clinical practice and takes on average 5-10 years. One of the main reasons for this delay is that the majority of patients first manifest depressive symptoms (depression-first BPD), often resulting in misdiagnosis with major depressive disorder (MDD). Misdiagnosis can lead to poor clinical outcomes, increased burden for patients and high healthcare costs. The goal of this proposal is to identify genetic and phenotypic signatures that distinguish depression-first BPD from MDD, in order to accelerate BPD diagnosis. During the mentored phase (K99) of the award, the PI will perform a genome wide association study to characterize the genetic architecture of differences between depression-first BPD and MDD, using available data from the collaborative Psychiatrics Genetics Consortium (Aim 1a). In a Dutch BPD cohort (n=1,750 cases) she will use machine learning methods to identify molecular, neuro-cognitive and behavioral profiles to classify depression-first BPD versus mania-first BPD (BPD with first onset of mania) and identify causal relations among predictive features (Aim 1b). During the independent phase (R00) of the award, the PI will study BPD diagnosis in a genotyped and extensively phenotyped Colombian cohort of ~5,000 cases with severe mood disorders, for which high quality electronic health records (EHR) have been collected since 2005. She will i) predict if and when patients will switch from MDD to BPD diagnosis, ii) distinguish BPD from matched MDD patients, and iii) classify BPD patients into depression-first and mania-first categories (Aims 2 and 3). She will estimate heritability of identified signatures and integrate results from both Dutch and Colombian cohorts. Building upon her expertise in complex trait genetics and method development, this award will allow the PI to extend her knowledge-base of clinical phenotyping in psychiatry; grow her expertise in statistical modeling; and strengthen her communication, mentoring, and leadership skills to prepare for a successful career as an independent researcher. The PI will complete the K99 phase of the award at UCLA, which fosters an ideal training environment. The strong advisory committee with Drs. Freimer, Ophoff, and Eskin (UCLA) and Dr. Sabatti (Stanford) will facilitate her scientific and personal development and promote her long-term career goal of tackling clinically relevant problems in psychiatric illness through the study of genetic, neuro-cognitive and behavioral mechanisms. The PI will first focus on the diagnosis of BPD, and then expand, in the future, into other psychiatric trait-mechanisms, such as disease severity and drug response. This award will be fundamental in support of her career goals. Successful completion of the specific aims of this proposal is likely to significantly improve the time to BPD diagnosis, and thereby reduce the burden of this debilitating disorder for patients and society. ! PROJECT NARRATIVE Because the majority of patients with bipolar disorder initially manifest depressive symptoms and are misdiagnosed with major depressive disorder, they often receive several years of sub-optimal treatment and experience poor clinical outcomes, until they obtain the correct diagnosis. I aim to identify genetic and phenotypic signatures that predict which patients diagnosed with depression are likely to develop bipolar disorder, which may accelerate diagnosis and reduce the burden of this disorder on patients and society.",Accelerating the diagnosis of bipolar disorder using genetic and phenotypic signatures,9674530,K99MH116115,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Antidepressive Agents ', ' anti-depressive agents ', ' anti-depressants ', ' anti-depressant drugs ', ' anti-depressant agent ', ' Antidepressants ', ' Antidepressant Drugs ', ' Antidepressant Agent ', ' Award ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Communication ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Leadership ', ' Literature ', ' Mentors ', ' Methodology ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Moods ', ' mortality ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Sampling Studies ', ' Societies ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Unipolar Depression ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' psychiatric genetics ', ' psychogenetics ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' base ', ' career ', ' method development ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' hypomania ', ' hypomanic ', ' Fostering ', ' Funding ', ' Onset of illness ', ' disorder onset ', ' disease onset ', ' Genetic ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Manic ', ' Manic State ', ' Manias ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Frequencies ', ' Source ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' Severity of illness ', ' disease severity ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' knowledge base ', ' knowledgebase ', ' trait ', ' skills ', ' member ', ' Categories ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' functional disability ', ' Functional impairment ', ' Genomics ', ' major depression disorder ', ' major depression ', ' clinical depression ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' Behavioral Mechanisms ', ' behavior mechanism ', ' Mechanisms of Behavior and Behavior Change ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' Behavioral ', ' clinical phenotype ', ' genome wide association study ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' Complex Genetic Trait ', ' suicidal morbidity ', ' suicide morbidity ', ' suicide death ', ' severe mental illness ', ' severe mental disorder ', ' serious mental illness ', ' serious mental disorder ', ' persistent mental illness ', ' chronic mental illness ', ' Outcome ', ' Heritability ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' genome-wide ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' clinical practice ', ' Genetic study ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' phenotypic data ', ' Colombian ', ' predictive signature ', ' optimal treatments ', ' optimal therapies ', ' genetic architecture ', ' multimodal data ', ' multi-modal data ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K99,2019,128483,CA-33,-0.004060316442807976
"Genetic determinants of puberty and later life health outcomes My long-term objective is to build on my existing track record in understanding the genetic mechanisms that influence differences in pubertal developmental timing and how they impact associated adverse health outcomes. Puberty is a key adolescent developmental milestone that is strongly associated with later life health outcomes, such as poor cardiometabolic health, type 2 diabetes, cancer, and osteoporosis. Hundreds of genetic variants across the genome are known to affect the timing of puberty (assessed by age at menarche in girls and age at voice break in boys), but the sex-specific impact of this genetic variation on health outcomes in adolescence and adulthood remain poorly characterized, particularly for boys. Furthermore, another key puberty trait, the pubertal height growth spurt, is less well characterized genetically, but reflects influences from pubertal timing, height growth potential, and body mass, and deeper investigation may reveal novel insights into the links between puberty and health outcomes. During the mentored K99 phase of this proposal, I will use a machine learning approach to choose the best variants across the genome that predict pubertal timing to build optimized polygenic scores (Aim 1a). These male and female-specific polygenic scores will then be tested for association across hundreds of clinical outcomes in biobanks composed of electronic health records (EHR) in tens of thousands of children and adults (Aim 1b). Subsequently, in the independent R00 phase, I will use causal inference analyses to understand the causal impact of genetically determined pubertal timing on identified health outcomes (Aim 1c). Meanwhile, I will combine what I have learned during Aim 1 with my previous expertise to lead a genome-wide association study of the pubertal height growth spurt in the Early Growth Genetics (EGG) consortium, combining longitudinal data from ~35,000 children across multiple cohorts, followed by trans-ethnic fine-mapping (Aim 2a). Finally, I will apply the pipeline developed in Aim 1 to derive PGS for pubertal growth and determine clinically relevant health outcomes linked to differences in pubertal growth trajectories (Aims 2b-d). In this Pathway to Independence proposal, I will complete training in computational and biomedical informatics techniques to capitalize on large-scale data resources, including linked genetic and EHR data from medical and population-based biobanks and longitudinal adolescent cohorts in the EGG consortium. My mentorship committee is composed of a team of world-renowned experts in genomics, informatics, and computational approaches, who have a strong track record in transitioning postdoctoral fellows into independent researchers. Combining my previous expertise with the proposed research and training objectives, together with a strong mentorship team, the securing of EGG leadership in this phenotypic area, and career development activities, I will be uniquely poised to achieve my goal of transitioning to an independent researcher with the skills needed to advance our understanding of the genetic underpinnings of pubertal development and its linked adult outcomes. This research will reveal novel understanding of the sex-specific molecular regulation of pubertal timing and how differences in pubertal timing are related to adverse adult health outcomes. This work will ultimately lead to studies that identify key areas where early interventions may mitigate the negative health effects of earlier or later than average pubertal timing, which serves the

"Statistical Modeling of Multiparental and Genetic Reference Populations PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Genetic crosses in model organisms play an essential role in understanding how heritable factors affect medically relevant traits. Such crosses have traditionally tended to be on a small scale with limited power to detect genetic effects, limited ability to localize causal variants, and limited options for replication. In the last decade, however, the emergence of larger-scale interdisciplinary research, cheaper genotyping and parallel advances in human genetics, has spurred the development of more sophisticated and powerful experimental designs. Foremost are those that incorporate two modern genetic design concepts: the multiparental population (MPP), whereby each subject is descended from a small, well-characterized set of genetically diverse inbred strains, with the goal of efficiently exploring a wide genetic landscape; and the genetic reference population (GRP), whereby subjects are drawn from a large and genetically diverse set of inbred strains, with the goal that the study population, and thereby the studies themselves, can be infinitely replicated. Their combination, the multiparental genetic reference population (MP-GRP), represents the state-of-the-art in complex trait genetics and has been implemented in a number of model organisms, including plants, flies, and rodents.  The proposed program of research focuses on the development of statistical and computational tools to advance the design and analysis of studies using MPPs, GRPs and MP-GRPs. It centers around addressing three interconnected questions.  1) How to take advantage of biological replicates in a genetically varying population? Directions considered include: more stable methods to detect genetically-induced phenotypic outliers; use of genetically-induced heteroskedasticity to improve statistical power and find variance-controlling genes; and more rigorous and expansive characterization of gene-by-treatment effects by using principles from causal inference.  2) How to navigate the complex design space of MP-GRPs and their derived crosses? Directions considered include: use of decision theory applied to Bayesian analysis of pilot data; incorporation of variance heterogeneity to control likely reproducibility.  3) How to approach quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis in MPPs and MP-GRPs? Directions considered include: making haplotype-based association more robust to uncertainty in haplotype state; combining haplotype- based with variant-based mapping; adaptive modeling of QTL complexity; machine learning of the allelic series; familywise error rate control through descent-based permutation.  Progress on these fronts will not only fill significant gaps in studies using MPPs, GRPs and MP-GRPs, but will also provide tools and insights that will allow these designs to be used in new and more powerful ways. PROJECT NARRATIVE (RELEVANCE) The proposed research will lead to improvements in the analysis and design of genetic studies on experimental models of human disease. Because the project focuses on statistical methodology applied to experimental model organism populations (including mouse, rats and Drosophila) the scientific output of the project is expected to be applicable to basic research focusing on any medical condition that can be studied in model organisms.",Statistical Modeling of Multiparental and Genetic Reference Populations,9672510,R35GM127000,"['Affect ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Genetic Crosses ', ' Decision Theory ', ' fruit fly ', ' Drosophila ', ' Drosophila genus ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Genes ', ' Population Genetics ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Haplotypes ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Human Genetics ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Modernization ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' Phenotype ', ' Plants ', ' Play ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Rat ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Rattus ', ' Research ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodent ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Experimental Models ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' insight ', ' Bayesian Analysis ', ' Bayesian statistics ', ' Bayesian statistical inference ', ' Bayesian statistical analysis ', ' Bayesian spatial analysis ', ' Bayesian network analysis ', ' Bayesian inference ', ' Bayesian computation ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Quantitative Trait Loci ', ' QTL ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' trait ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Modeling ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Inbred Strain ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' fly ', ' Flies ', ' Output ', ' Complex Genetic Trait ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' Heritability ', ' treatment effect ', ' human disease ', ' Genetic study ', ' study population ', ' causal variant ', ' causative variant ', ' causative mutation ', ' causal mutation ', ' causal gene ', ' causal allele ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R35,2019,336445,NC-04,-0.0253641931283459
"Integrative Bioinformatics Approaches to Human Brain Genomics and Connectomics Project Summary (Abstract)  Human brain connectomics and imaging genomics are two emerging research fields enabled by recent advances in multi-modal neuroimaging and high throughput omics technologies. Integrating brain imaging genomics and connectomics holds great promise for a systematic characterization of both the human brain connectivity and the connectivity-based neurobiological pathway from its genetic architecture to its influences on cognition and behavior. Rich multi-modal neuroimaging data coupled with high density omics data are available from large-scale landmark studies such as the NIH Human Connectome Project (HCP) and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). The unprecedented scale and complexity of these data sets, however, have presented critical computational bottlenecks requiring new concepts and enabling tools.  To bridge the gap, this project is proposed to develop and validate novel integrative bioinformatics approaches to human brain genomics and connectomics, and has three aims. Aim 1 is to develop a novel computational pipeline for a systematic characterization of structural connectome optimized for imaging genomics, where special consideration will be taken to address important issues including reliable tractography and network construction, systematic extraction of network attributes, identification of important network components (e.g., hubs, communities and rich clubs), prioritization of network attributes towards genomic analysis, and identification of outcome-relevant network measures. Aim 2 is to develop novel bioinformatics strategies to determining genetic basis of structural connectome, including novel approaches for analyzing graph-based phenotype data and learning outcome-relevant associations, and an ensemble of effective learning modules to handle a comprehensive set of scenarios on mining genome-connectome associations at the genome-wide connectome-wide scale. Aim 3 is to develop a visual analytic software system for interactive visual exploration and mining of fiber-tracts and brain networks with their genetic determinants and functional outcomes, where new visualization and exploration methods will be implemented for seamlessly combining human expertise and machine intelligence to enable novel contextually meaningful discoveries.  This project is expected to produce novel bioinformatics algorithms and tools for comprehensive joint analysis of large scale genomics and connectomics data. The availability of these powerful methods and tools is critical for full knowledge discovery and exploitation of major connectomics and imaging genomics initiatives such as HCP and ADNI. In addition, they can also help enable new computational applications in many other biomedical research areas where integrative analysis of connectomics and genomics data are of interest. Via thorough test and evaluation on HCP and ADNI data, these methods and tools will be demonstrated to have considerable potential for a better understanding of the interplay between genes, brain connectivity and function, and thus be expected to impact biomedical research in general and benefit public health outcomes. Public Health Relevance (Narrative) Integrating human connectomics and brain imaging genomics offers enormous potential, allowing us to perform systems biology approaches of the brain to better understand the interplay between genes, brain connectivity, and phenotypic outcomes (e.g., cognition, behavior, disorder).

"Revealing the transcriptional and developmental mechanisms of interneuron identity Cortical GABAergic interneurons are critical components of neural circuitry, and their dysfunction has been linked to neurodevelopmental diseases. Although the diversity of interneurons is not disputed, both the extent of their heterogeneity and the gene regulatory mechanisms that drive it remain unclear. Recent advances in single cell RNA-sequencing technology have shed new light on this issue, enabling the prediction of novel interneuron subtypes based on gene expression. Cross-species meta-analysis would provide key insight into conserved mechanisms of interneuron diversity. However, cross-study integration remains a major challenge. I hypothesize that interneuron identity is defined by unifying molecular processes across species. This project is designed to reveal these processes by using an integrative, cross-species approach to explore the transcriptional, epigenetic, and developmental mechanisms that govern interneuron diversity. First, I have shown that mouse interneuron subtypes replicably express genes associated with cell-cell communication, enabling cross-dataset meta-analysis. The goal of Aim 1 is to use improved computational and phylogenetic methods to define homologous interneuron subtypes across species and identify robust gene targets. Second, preliminary investigation of single cell methylome-sequencing data indicates that it can be readily aligned with expression data. In Aim 2 I will use machine learning methods to generate networks from epigenomic and expression data and identify subtype-specific regulatory features. Third, I have shown that transcriptional profiles from developing neurons can be quantitatively assessed with respect to adult expression data. Aim 3 will use meta-analytic aggregation of temporal inference methods to enable cross-dataset comparisons and define conserved developmental gene programs. These studies will reveal a multidimensional portrait of interneuron molecular identity and enable genetic access to these cell types, a key aim of the BRAIN Initiative. I also propose an extensive training plan that will support my transition to independence. CSHL provides an outstanding research environment, with unequaled opportunities for scientific discussion, advanced skills training and career development. I have assembled an exceptional team of collaborators and mentors who will help me to achieve my goals. Dr. Jesse Gillis, expert in transcriptome meta-analysis, and Dr. Josh Huang, expert in GABAergic interneuron identity, will be my mentors. Dr. Bing Ren, Dr. Adam Siepel, Dr. Guoping Feng, Dr. Jessica Tollkuhn and Dr. Michael Greenberg will be collaborators and members of my advisory committee, ensuring that my research will be of the highest caliber. My training will also involve coursework in multiomics data integration and comparative genomics, and I will continue my professional development by presenting at international conferences, mentoring students and attending workshops at CSHL. Together, the proposed studies and professional training will ensure my successful transition to an independent position at a major university where I will lead a lab that will advance the goals of the BRAIN Initiative. Interneurons are key components of neural circuitry, acting as the cellular `brakes' that dampen neuronal activity. Although it has long been known that interneurons come in many different shapes and sizes, both the extent of this diversity and its consequences for brain function remain unclear. In this project, we propose that by combining information about the gene activity and epigenetic landscapes of interneurons across multiple species we will generate an integrated, multi-layered portrait of interneuron diversity which we can use to understand brain",Revealing the transcriptional and developmental mechanisms of interneuron identity,9754408,K99MH120050,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Biology ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Cell-to-Cell Interaction ', ' Cell Interaction ', ' Cell Communication ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Chromatin ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' fire ', ' Fires ', ' Fire - disasters ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Developmental Gene ', ' trans acting element ', ' regulatory gene ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' genetically engineered ', ' Recombinant DNA Technology ', ' Genetic Engineering Molecular Biology ', ' Genetic Engineering Biotechnology ', ' Genetic Engineering ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Institutes ', ' Internuncial Neuron ', ' Internuncial Cell ', ' Intercalated Neurons ', ' Intercalary Neuron ', ' Connector Neuron ', ' Interneurons ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Maintenance ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Primates Mammals ', ' Primates ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' transcription factor ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Universities ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' lateral geniculate nucleus ', ' lateral geniculate ', ' Lateral Geniculate Body ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Gene Targeting ', ' Functional disorder ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' cell type ', ' Techniques ', ' skills training ', ' developmental neurobiology ', ' experience ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' neural circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' career development ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' Portraits ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Diameter ', ' Caliber ', ' Data ', ' Developmental Process ', ' International ', ' Resolution ', ' Cell Maintenance ', ' Cell Growth and Maintenance ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Phylogenetic Analysis ', ' Phylogenetics ', ' Validation ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' epigenomics ', ' neuroinformatics ', ' data integration ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' comparative genomics ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' methylome ', ' differential expression ', ' transcriptional differences ', ' differentially expressed ', ' BRAIN initiative ', ' student mentoring ', ' student-led learning ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' transcriptome ', ' global transcription profile ', ' global gene expression ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic dataset ', ' genomic data-set ', ' single-cell RNA sequencing ', ' single cell RNA-seq ', ' scRNA-seq ', ' Multiomic Data ', ' multiple omic data ', ' ']",NIMH,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,K99,2019,118421,NY-03,-0.012269297619996088
"Mechanobiology of aortic smooth muscle cells in human iPSC-based models of Marfan Syndrome PROJECT SUMMARY Marfan Syndrome (MFS), one of the most common heritable connective tissue disorders, affects 1 in 5,000 individuals and has destructive manifestations in multiple organ systems; notably the cardiovascular system. MFS is an autosomal dominant disease caused by a genetic mutation in the Fibrillin-1 gene leading to aberrant TGFβ signaling, and frequently results in aortic aneurysm, dissection, and death. Interestingly, the associated degeneration within the aortic vessel wall almost always occurs in the aortic root or ascending aorta and not in the descending or abdominal aorta; while this putatively reflects regional differences in hemodynamic stress, antihypertensive treatment alone is not effective in managing aortic aneurysm in MFS. Alternatively, it is also the case that aortic smooth muscle cells (ASMCs), which predominate the vasoactive medial layer of the vessel wall, have heterogeneous subtypes stemming from distinct developmental germ-layers based on their anatomical location; Neuroectoderm (NE) origin gives rise to ascending ASMCs and Paraxial mesoderm (PM) origin gives rise to descending ASMCs. This project will use origin-specific ASMCs differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from patients with MFS and healthy controls to test a novel hypothesis that developmental origin causes location-specific abnormalities in ASMCs associated with medial degeneration in MFS. Additionally, it will explore for biomarkers of presymptomatic congenital defects in Marfan Syndrome to identify novel targets for prophylactic therapeutic intervention. These studies will characterize phenotypic differences in human ASMC subtypes at the cellular and tissue level with stem-cell culturing and vascular tissue engineering techniques. Using state-of-the-art core facilities we will also conduct transcriptomic and proteomic analysis on these cellular and tissue models to cultivate a rich biological profile for bioinformatic analysis. Furthermore, we will develop a bioinformatics pipeline to elucidate novel prophylactic targets inherently responsible for ascending aortic MFS-induced medial degeneration, using our uniquely combined phenotypic, transcriptomic, and proteomic results as input. Lastly, based on our bioinformatic outputs we will test our intervention on our human iPSC-based in vitro models and compare to treatment with Losartan, a commonly used anti-hypertensive drug that also exhibits unique anti-remodeling properties and has shown promise for managing the symptoms of MFS in animals and in patients. The training plan for this fellowship will focus on technical skills, experimental design and critical analysis, critique of published scientific data, and presentation skills. It will be achieved by regular mentor meetings, journal clubs, conference presentations, bi- annual committee meetings, and advanced coursework. The majority of training will occur in the Costa Lab at the Cardiovascular Research Center at ISMMS, a highly active and collaborative environment with available mentors and students aligned with my research topics and career goals. Additional training will occur in the Ramirez Lab with senior researchers in Marfan Syndrome and biochemical investigation techniques. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research proposes a bioengineering approach for investigating new human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-based cellular and 3D tissue models of Marfan Syndrome (MFS), a rare connective tissue disorder that frequently causes aortic aneurysm and dissection specifically in the ascending aorta. Our findings will elucidate mechanobiological differences in aortic smooth muscle cells of distinct embryologic origin, and their underlying mechanisms of response to mechanical stimuli. This will help improve our understanding of aneurysm localization in MFS, and guide more effective therapies for MFS patients in the future.",Mechanobiology of aortic smooth muscle cells in human

"Real-time Non-Rigid 3D Reconstruction and Registration for Laparoscopic-guided Minimally Invasive Liver Surgery Project Summary/Abstract Liver deformation leads to difficulties in tumor localization during minimally invasive liver surgery (MILS). The goal of this proposal is to develop an efficient surgical navigation tool for MILS by compensating for liver deformation and mapping preoperative data to the patient’s anatomy. Specifically, we will develop a non-rigid simultaneously localization and mapping (SLAM) approach to estimate the deformation of liver surface from stereo laparoscopy videos. We will develop machine-learning methods to detect landmarks and perform non- rigid registration. The algorithms will be implemented on a GPU to achieve real-time. Preliminary data has demonstrated the feasibility. During the R00 phase, we will mainly address the clinical needs and develop novel ways to provide intraoperative guidance. This project will greatly improve the tumor resection accuracy in MILS. The candidate for this award Dr. Haoyin Zhou is a postdoc at Surgical Planning Laboratory (SPL), Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH) and Harvard Medical School (HMS). Dr. Zhou has extensive experience and expertise in computer vision, machine learning and their applications in medicine. BWH is an international leader in basic, clinical and translational research on human diseases, and has established multiple research programs to promote the work and professional career development of young investigators. National Center for Image Guided Therapy, and Advanced Multi-modality Image Guided Operating (AMIGO) suite will greatly support this research. Dr. Zhou’s long-term research goal is to develop and apply advanced computer vision and machine learning technologies to improve understanding, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases for better health care. His long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator working at the frontier of medical image processing and image-guided therapy. To achieve these goals, Dr. Zhou plans to receive more education and training in the following four areas: (1) Critical training in conducting translational research in the hospital environment with surgeons and radiologists, (2) knowledge in the development of technologies for surgical guidance, (3) training in machine learning and its applications in medicine, and (4) training on writing grant applications independently and seeking funding.

"Psoriasis Center of Research Translation The Psoriasis Center of Research Translation at Case Western Reserve University (CORT) will advance translational discovery and application in psoriasis using a cutting-edge systems biology approach that integrates patient-centered data within a rich and synergistic /collaborative institutional environment. We will leverage extensive preclinical, clinical and translational resources with the expertise and experience of our CWRU interdisciplinary research team, which encompasses bioinformatics, micro/myocobiome, psoriasis patient care, cutaneous immunology and transgenic models.  The overall goal of the CORT is to combine new bioinformatic methodologies with advanced murine and human experimental approaches to translate scientific findings into clinical applications that more nimbly advance therapy for psoriasis and related inflammatory comorbidities. Our highly innovative, synergistic and cross-disciplinary CORT model will use a collaborative research project (CRP) as a central hub with bi- directional input from 2 highly interactive research cores, to refine and test hypotheses, identify and test drug leads and advance understanding of psoriasis and related inflammatory comorbidities. To do so, the CRP will integrate input from the: 1) Preclinical Modeling Core (PMC), that will provide and customize our many validated, unique transgenic psoriasiform animal models and translatable human xenograft approaches, essential to translating new mediator/pathway roles and drug leads; 2) Applied Meta-`Omics Core (AMC), that will apply multi-platform (transcriptome, metabolome, micro/mycobiome) bioinformatics to individual patient and murine samples to identify novel pathway-specific targets. Iterative experimental testing of these targets and feedback from the PMC and CRP will identify key novel pathways critical for psoriasis pathogenesis likely to benefit from intervention by new drugs or repurposed existing drugs for psoriasis therapy.  Our patient-centered translational approach will exploit and enhance a novel, comprehensive and highly annotated database of ~850 psoriasis/psoriatic arthritis single-patient case records that combines clinical information derived from CLEARPATH (an Ohio medical provider consortium-based unified EMR repository for research access), with inflammation markers that stratify subsets. Into each patient's EMR, we will directly integrate his/her meta'Omics data created by the AMC working with the CRP, to create an 'Omics-integrated EMR (EMRi) data set. These cohesive multi-platform personal data records will identify psoriasis patient endotypes based upon unique perturbations identified from their “meta'Omics” analyses. Our overarching hypothesis is that by powerfully combining existing and developing psoriasis basic science datasets, patient records, bioinformatics and computational systems biology with bi-directional mouse and human studies, we will identify new therapeutic targets and repurposed drugs that can be expeditiously moved to clinical trials, improving psoriasis treatment and patient care. The Psoriasis CORT at Case Western Reserve University and University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center uses emerging capabilities of data analyses that can assemble many aspects of a single psoriasis patient in great detail, including their gene expression in skin and blood cells, the skin microbes (both bacterial and fungal) and the clinical features that are recorded in their electronic medical record (EMR). Using advanced computer algorithms to compare in-house patient data against externally available large databases, we can identify drugs already approved by the FDA that may be repurposed to treat psoriasis, and validate/invalidate them in animal models and patient cells.",Psoriasis Center of Research Translation,9792242,P50AR070590,"['Psoriatic Arthritis ', ' Psoriasis Arthropathica ', '

"Neuroimaging Analysis Center (NAC) Project Summary/Abstract The ability to access huge cohorts of patient medical records and radiology data, the emergence of ever-more detailed imaging modalities, and the availability of unprecedented computer processing power marks the pos- sibility for a new era in neuroimaging, disease understanding, and patient treatment. To unlock the full medical potential made possible by these new technologies, new algorithms and clinically-relevant techniques must be developed by close collaboration between computer scientists, physicians, and medical researchers. We are excited to propose a national resource center with the goal of finding new ways of extracting disease characteristics from advanced imaging and computation, and to make these methods available to the larger medical community through a proven methodology of world-class research, open-source software, and exten- sive collaboration. The overarching theme for this P41 renewal is the discovery and analysis of novel imaging phenotypes to characterize disease. We use the term imaging phenotypes to describe patterns or features of disease that can be detected through imaging (predominantly MRI) followed by machine learning, statistical analysis, feature detection, and correlation with other indicators of disease such as structured patient infor- mation. The three proposed Technology Research & Development (TR&D) projects address this common question us- ing a variety of complementary approaches and clinical testbeds. TR&D 1 addresses microstructure of tissue, including novel imaging methods to detect tumor microstructure. TR&D 2 investigates rich spatial patterns of disease extracted from clinical imaging with a focus on cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative conditions such as stroke. Finally, TR&D 3 proposes novel image and connectivity-based features that can be correlated with a variety of diseases, with a clinical emphasis on pediatric brain development. Technical innovation will be driven by intense collaboration between the TR&Ds and key collaborators in neurosurgery, neurology, and pe- diatrics. The TR&Ds will leverage recent important developments in the fields of image acquisition, machine learning, and data science to identify and exploit novel imaging phenotypes of disease. Building on our long history of developing clinically-relevant methods, each TR&D includes a translational and clinical validation aim to ensure our work is clinically relevant and effective at meeting the driving clinical goals. NAC's proven software engi- neering, translation, and dissemination infrastructure, along with its established network of academic, medical, and industrial partners, enhance the center's value as a national resource.

"Center for Undiagnosed Diseases at Stanford Abstract The Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) has increased access for patients with undiagnosed diseases to the nation’s leading clinicians and scientists. Phase II of the Network will facilitate the transition of UDN efforts toward sustainability, through the expansion of clinical sites, refinement of methods, and integration with regular clinical practice. Here, we propose a program of study that will (1) facilitate timely, accurate diagnosis of patients with undiagnosed diseases; (2) improve diagnostic rates through novel approaches to data analysis and integration; and (3) explore underlying mechanisms of disease to accelerate therapeutic drug discovery. In Aim 1, we propose to evaluate patients referred to the UDN through a protocol that includes pre-visit chart review and genetic counseling followed by an individualized visit during which standardized phenotypic and environmental data are collected. Biosamples facilitate genomic, multi-omic, and cellular evaluation of disease. Expansion of fibroblasts and, in selected cases, generation of induced Pluripotent Stem Cell (iPSC) lines facilitates scientific investigation of the underlying diseases. We will expand our program of patient outreach, particularly to under-served populations. We will extend our UDN-based genomic medicine educational program both in scope and by broadening its eligibility. In Aim 2, we propose to develop and implement novel methods in areas of high potential to increase diagnostic yield. This includes algorithms for the detection of small genomic insertions and deletions as well as large scale structural variation. We will develop alignment algorithms using graph reference genomes and promote the use of long-read sequencing technologies. We will apply machine learning to the systematic integration of RNA sequencing, metabolomic, and phenotypic data with the electronic medical record and the entire medical literature to improve diagnostic yield. In Aim 3, we propose to facilitate diagnosis through enhanced cellular and model organisms phenotyping. We will implement immunomic and metagenomic approaches such as T cell, B cell and unknown organism sequencing for undiagnosed cases. We will utilize methods for moderate- and high-throughput phenotyping of iPS-derived cells and promote novel drug discovery via high throughput drug screening both with FDA- approved drugs and large scale small molecule libraries. Beyond Phase II, Stanford Medicine has made a strong commitment to the continuation of the Center for Undiagnosed Diseases at Stanford through a multi- million dollar institutional commitment. In summary, we aim to build on the success of Phase I of the UDN by streamlining processes, maximizing collaboration and outreach, optimizing computational algorithms, extending scientific investigation towards therapeutic discovery, and promoting engagement of hospital leaders, clinicians, scientists, policy-makers, and philanthropists to ensure this national resource is sustained long beyond the duration of this award. Narrative We will refine the operations of the Center for Undiagnosed Diseases at Stanford in coordination with other Phase II sites of the Undiagnosed Diseases Network to diagnose the undiagnosed and facilitate a transition to sustainability. Our Center will bring Stanford’s long history in technology development, genomic data analysis, stem cell biology, and translational science to the team-based diagnosis and care of patients with undiagnosed disease. We will refine existing procedures to further optimize the diagnostic process and integrate care of the undiagnosed into clinical practice while preserving the scientific mission of the Undiagnosed Diseases Network.",Center for Undiagnosed Diseases at Stanford,9789914,U01HG010218,"['Algorithms ', ' Award ', ' B-Lymphocytes ', ' B-cell ', ' B-Cells ', ' B cells ', ' B cell ', ' B blood cells ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Family ', ' Fibroblasts ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Genetic Counseling ', ' Goals ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Hospitals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Investments ', ' Leadership ', ' Libraries ', ' Literature ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' living system ', ' Organism ', ' Organoids ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Reagent ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Remote Operation (Robotics) ', ' Robotics ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Standardization ', ' thymus derived lymphocyte ', ' T-Cells ', ' T-Lymphocyte ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Universities ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Generations ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' sample collection ', ' specimen collection ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Collaborations ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Committee Membership ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Investigation ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' Visit ', ' meetings ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' small molecule libraries ', ' chemical library ', ' Gene Silencing ', ' transcriptional silencing ', ' Gene Inactivation ', ' cohort ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' technology development ', ' tech development ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Graph ', ' outreach ', ' Modeling ', ' Genomics ', ' drug discovery ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabolomics ', ' Consent ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' International ', ' research clinical testing ', ' clinical test ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Ontology ', ' Translational Research ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' insertion/deletion mutation ', ' insertion/deletion ', ' insertion-deletion mutation ', ' insertion-deletion ', ' indel ', ' virtual ', ' data integration ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' next generation ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' clinical research site ', ' clinical site ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Cell model ', ' Cellular model ', ' Metagenomics ', ' Functional Metagenomics ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' computer algorithm ', ' Network-based ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new drugs ', ' new drug treatments ', ' induced pluripotent stem cell ', ' iPSCs ', ' iPSC ', ' iPS ', ' FDA approved ', ' stem cell biology ', ' genome-wide ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' clinical practice ', ' operation ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' screening ', ' accurate diagnosis ', ' support network ', ' multiple omics ', ' multiomics ', ' Genomic medicine ', ' reference genome ', ' reference assembly ', ' phenotypic data ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic dataset ', ' genomic data-set ', ' patient outreach ', ' preservation ', ' Drug Screening ', ' Child Health ', ' deep learning ', ' Multiomic Data ', ' multiple omic data ', ' ']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U01,2019,1500000,CA-18,0.009120490261998026
"Development of tools for site-directed analysis of gene function The overarching goal of this application is to create tools and efficient methods to define genes that can promote human health. While a tremendous amount of data has been cataloged on gene mutation and changes in gene expression associated with complex human disease, our understanding of those genes that could be co-opted to restore patient health is lacking. To address this need and test for genes that when restored to wild type function promote health, we propose develop mutagenic, revertible and conditional alleles that provide spatial and temporal control of gene expression. The ability to make site-specific, untagged mutant alleles in zebrafish and other models has been greatly advanced by custom nucleases that include TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9 systems. These systems operate on the same principle: they are designed to bind to specific sequences in the genome and create a double strand break. The goals of this proposal leverage the activities of TALEN and CRISPR/Cas9 technologies to make site-specific double strand breaks. First, we propose to develop a suite of vectors to make integration alleles that are highly mutagenic and allow production of conditional and revertible alleles. Second, we propose to develop methods to generate predictable alleles in zebrafish at TALEN- and CRISPR/Cas9-induced double strand break sites by invoking the microhomology mediated end-joining pathway. Third, leveraging our preliminary data, we propose to improve methods for homology directed repair with oligonucleotides to create disease associated alleles in zebrafish and for site-specific integration using homologous recombination at TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9 cut sites. Fourth, we propose use single-strand annealing at TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9 cut sites to promote precise transgene integration to make tagged and highly mutagenic allele. These tools and techniques will have direct implications for providing precise gene editing techniques to assess the roles of genes in disease and their ability to promote health following disease progression. While we will develop these methodologies in zebrafish due to their ease of gene delivery, we anticipate these methodologies will not only enhance the efficiency of gene editing but will be readily adaptable for use in other model organisms and large animals. In our opinion, this will have important implications for modeling human disease and health in animal systems by greatly enhancing the ability to make predictible alleles, small nucleotide polymorphisms similar to those associated with human disease, and conditional alleles to test for the ability of a gene to restore health. The central goal for this application is to define genes that can promote or restore human health. For this, we propose to develop efficient integration of highly mutagenic and conditional cassettes into genes in a site-directed manner. The strategies proposed employ the ability of designer nucleases to create DNA double strand breaks and to site-specifically direct biochemical activities to genes of interest. The technologies developed will have important implications for modeling human disease in animal systems.",Development of tools for site-directed analysis of gene function,9654794,R24OD020166,"['Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Animals ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Communities ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Embryonic ', ' Embryo ', ' Gene Expression ', ' genomic therapy ', ' genetic therapy ', ' gene-based therapy ', ' Genetic Intervention ', ' Gene Transfer Clinical ', ' DNA Therapy ', ' gene therapy ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' promoting health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Laboratories ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Microinjections ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Biological Models ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' Nucleotides ', ' oligos ', ' Oligo ', ' Oligonucleotides ', ' optical ', ' Optics ', ' Patients ', ' polymorphism ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' Production ', ' Proteins ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Publishing ', ' Reagent ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Work ', ' Zebra Fish ', ' Zebra Danio ', ' Danio rerio ', ' Brachydanio rerio ', ' Zebrafish ', ' recombinase ', ' Generations ', ' Mutagenesis Molecular Biology ', ' Genetics-Mutagenesis ', ' Mutagenesis ', ' Mediating ', ' Custom ', ' method development ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' repaired ', ' repair ', ' Biochemical ', ' insight ', ' Recovery ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Systems Integration ', ' Collaborations ', ' Transgenes ', ' gene function ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Catalogs ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' Gene Mutation ', ' Gene Alteration ', ' mutant ', ' nuclease ', ' homologous recombination ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' Modeling ', ' functional genomics ', ' Genomics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Regenerative Medicine ', ' Address ', ' DNA Double Strand Break ', ' Data ', ' Mutate ', ' Gene-Modified ', ' gene modification ', ' Validation ', ' Modification ', ' Gene Delivery ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Operating System ', ' vector ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Genome engineering ', ' site-specific integration ', ' human disease ', ' therapeutic target ', ' induced pluripotent stem cell ', ' iPSCs ', ' iPSC ', ' iPS ', ' tool development ', ' therapeutic development ', ' therapeutic agent development ', ' CRISPR/Cas technology ', ' Cas nuclease technology ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 technology ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 ', ' CRISPR/Cas method ', ' CRISPR-based tool ', ' CRISPR-based technology ', ' CRISPR-based technique ', ' CRISPR-based method ', ' CRISPR-CAS-9 ', ' CRISPR technology ', ' CRISPR technique ', ' CRISPR methodology ', ' CRISPR method ', ' transcription activator-like effector nucleases ', ' TALENs ', ' TALEN technology ', ' TALE nuclease ', ' TAL endonuclease ', ' TAL effector nuclease ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' human model ', ' ']",OD,IOWA STATE UNIVERSITY,R24,2019,778412,IA-04,-0.007549041916967939
"Reactome: An Open Knowledgebase of Human Pathways Project Summary  We seek renewal of the core operating funding for the Reactome Knowledgebase of Human Biological Pathways and Processes. Reactome is a curated, open access biomolecular pathway database that can be freely used and redistributed by all members of the biological research community. It is used by clinicians, geneti- cists, genomics researchers, and molecular biologists to interpret the results of high-throughput experimental studies, by bioinformaticians seeking to develop novel algorithms for mining knowledge from genomic studies, and by systems biologists building predictive models of normal and disease variant pathways.  Our curators, PhD-level scientists with backgrounds in cell and molecular biology work closely with in- dependent investigators within the community to assemble machine-readable descriptions of human biological pathways. Each pathway is extensively checked and peer-reviewed prior to publication to ensure its assertions are backed up by the primary literature, and that human molecular events inferred from orthologous ones in animal models have an auditable inference chain. Curated Reactome pathways currently cover 8930 protein- coding genes (44% of the translated portion of the genome) and ~150 RNA genes. We also offer a network of reliable ‘functional interactions’ (FIs) predicted by a conservative machine-learning approach, which covers an additional 3300 genes, for a combined coverage of roughly 60% of the known genome.  Over the next five years, we will: (1) curate new macromolecular entities, clinically significant protein sequence variants and isoforms, and drug-like molecules, and the complexes these entities form, into new reac- tions; (2) supplement normal pathways with alternative pathways targeted to significant diseases and devel- opmental biology; (3) expand and automate our tools for curation, management and community annotation; (4) integrate pathway modeling technologies using probabilistic graphical models and Boolean networks for pathway and network perturbation studies; (5) develop additional compelling software interfaces directed at both computational and lab biologist users; and (6) and improve outreach to bioinformaticians, molecular bi- ologists and clinical researchers. Project Narrative  Reactome represents one of a very small number of open access curated biological pathway databases. Its authoritative and detailed content has directly and indirectly supported basic and translational research studies with over-representation analysis and network-building tools to discover patterns in high-throughput data.

In our new CTSA hub, we will build on our current CTSA's successes over the past 5½ years, with unique innovative integration of exceptional training approaches, including: 1) mentored career development within CTSA-supported multidisciplinary translational teams (MTTs); 2) an emphasis on individual development plans (IDPs) and pre-established C&T research competencies tailored to the needs of the individual scholar, but also emphasizing team-based competencies; 3) development of leadership competencies through participation in a new Leadership Development Academy; 4) an Academy of Research Mentors (ARM), based within our Institute for Translational Sciences (ITS), to foster mentoring and mentor training; 5) a linked Translational Research Scholars Program (TRSP), which provides an expanded peer group and a wider impact across the institution, with twice-monthly career development seminars and a focus on scholars' research; 6) development of entrepreneurial skills and leadership through participation in a UT System-funded Healthcare Entrepreneurship Program; and 7) collaboration and dissemination of program experience to other CTSA hubs in the Texas Regional CTSA Consortium, and the national CTSA Consortium. An important feature of our KL2 Scholars Program is its linked position within the continuum of career development, from graduate student training in our CTSA TL1 Training Core to the production of independently funded C&T faculty members. Our program is enhanced with by financial support from our Provost's office for scholar expenses, ITS education administrators, the ARM, and the Office of Faculty Affairs, which is focused on faculty development at UTMB. UTMB also ranks nationally in promoting diversity, which will enhance our recruitment of underrepresented minority scholars by the participation of faculty from our Hispanic Center of Excellence, and our Medical School Enrichment Program. Our KL2 Program is well-integrated with other institutional education activities, including our Human Pathophysiology and Translational Medicine graduate program, and courses targeted toward scientific writing, biostatistics, and study design. Early-career faculty as Phase 1 TRSP scholars can compete to become CTSA-supported KL2 Scholars, and with acquisition of their first mentored K-level grants (e.g., K08), advance to a Phase 2 TRSP Scholar, then focusing on the transition from mentored to independent grant funding. Upon acquisition of independent (e.g. R01) funding, scholars advance to become Phase 3 TRSP Scholars and Associate Members in the ARM, to facilitate their development of mentoring skills, and eventually to full ARM membership, with demonstrated success in C&T science mentoring. Our KL2 Scholars Program thus integrates novel team-based training, leadership, and mentoring approaches to foster the career development of future leaders in C&T research.

"Computational Methods for Next-Generation Comparative Genomics PROJECT SUMMARY Recent advances in regulatory genomics, especially 3D genome organization in cell nucleus, suggest that existing methods for cross-species comparisons are limited in their ability to fully understand the evolution of non-coding genome function. In particular, it is known that genomes are compartmentalized to distinct compartments in the nucleus such as nuclear lamina and nuclear speckles. Such nuclear compartmentalization is an essential feature of higher-order genome organization and is linked to various important genome functions such as DNA replication timing and transcription. Unfortunately, to date no study exists that directly compares nuclear compartmentalization between human and other mammals. In addition, there are no computational models available that consider the continuous nature of multiple features of nuclear compartmentalization and function, which is critical to integrate genome-wide functional genomic data and datasets that measure cytological distance to multiple compartments across species. In this project, we will develop novel algorithms and generate new datasets to directly address two key questions: (1) How to identify the evolutionary patterns of nuclear compartmentalization? (2) What types of sequence evolution may drive spatial localization changes across species? The proposed project represents the first endeavor in comparative genomics for nuclear compartmentalization. Our Specific Aims are: (1) Developing new probabilistic models for identifying evolutionary patterns of nuclear compartmentalization. (2) Identifying genome-wide evolutionary patterns of nuclear compartmentalization in primate species based on TSA-seq and Repli-seq. (3) Developing new algorithms to connect sequence features to nuclear compartmentalization through cross-species comparisons. Successful completion of these aims will result in novel computational tools and new datasets that will be highly valuable for the comparative genomics community.

"Integrating Machine Learning and Genomic Approaches to Understand Cerebral Small Vessel Disease Pathogenesis from White Matter Hyperintensity Patterns PROJECT SUMMARY  As a neurointensivist and neurologist at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (WUSM), my career goal is to develop an independent research program as a computational biologist capable of using advanced bioinformatics and statistical methods to integrate analysis of large-scale neuroimaging and genetic data, with the aim of deepening understanding of the biological mechanisms influencing cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) and identifying new targets for therapeutic development. As a first step towards this goal, I have designed an innovative proposal that combine machine-learning (ML) methods and integrated imaging genetic analyses of large-scale neuroimaging and genetic data to improve characterization of SVD disease mechanisms.  The clinical, imaging, and etiologic heterogeneity of SVD have impeded efforts to uncover the pathophysiology of this common and debilitating neurological disease. White matter hyperintensities (WMH), a major imaging endpoint of SVD, are comprised of multiple SVD pathologic processes. Growing evidence suggests location-specific vulnerability of brain parenchyma to different underlying SVD pathologic processes, in which spatially localized WMH patterns may reflect distinct SVD etiologies. Characterizing WMH spatial pattern variations in SVD will not only provide insights into underlying pathogenesis, such as vascular amyloid deposition, arteriolosclerosis, and other less well defined or as-yet unknown disease mechanisms, but also lead to creation of novel imaging biomarkers of these SVD pathologic processes. This proposal addresses a key inadequacy, as existing WMH pattern definitions are determined empirically and cannot distinguish overlapping SVD etiologies and risk factors. In this proposal, I aim to capture WMH spatial pattern variations that reflect distinct SVD etiologies in an unbiased manner, by applying clustering analysis/ML methods to structural MRI data to create novel etiology-specific SVD imaging phenotypes. Moreover, given that genetics influence the variance of WMH, I will integrate genetic analyses of these WMH patterns to uncover novel mechanisms that influence SVD pathogenesis. My preliminary data demonstrate the feasibility of identifying data-driven WMH spatial pattern variations, which are specific to distinct SVD etiologies, and allow detection of genetic risk variants that may help inform SVD pathologic processes.  My career plan leverages the extensive resources and exceptional environments at WUSM, under the guidance of a multidisciplinary mentorship team with expertise across diverse fields including cerebrovascular physiology, neuroimaging, informatics, genetics, and machine learning (Drs. Jin-Moo Lee, Daniel Marcus, Carlos Cruchaga and Yasheng Chen). In this Career Development Award, I propose to: 1) determine distinct WMH spatial patterns that can discriminate underlying SVD pathology and/or risk factors by applying pattern analysis ML methods to structural MRI data from three unique cohorts (n=2,710) enriched for different SVD pathologies (Aim 1a), and examining if the ML-defined WMH patterns segregate individuals by well-defined SVD risk factors as biologic validation (Aim 1b), and 2) identify genetic variants (Aim 2a) associated with WMH patterns that reflect diverse pathologic processes influencing SVD using genome wide association and gene-based analyses; replicate the top variants (Aim 2b) in an independent population-based cohort (n=21,708); and use advanced bioinformatics tools to uncover new biologic pathways associated with WMH spatial patterns (Aim 2c).  This research proposal and accompanying development plan with focused training in machine learning, neuroimaging, and multivariate methods for integrated imaging genetics analysis, will build on my background in genetics towards a career investigating cerebrovascular disorders using translational bioinformatics. This Award will provide me with the necessary training to evolve into an independent investigator with a computational research program that can integrate large imaging and genetics datasets to derive results that are highly relevant to the prevention and treatment of cerebrovascular disease in my clinical patient population. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is one of the most prevalent neurological conditions in older adults, and a leading cause of stroke and cognitive impairment, for which existing treatment and preventative options have been limited or lack efficacy. This project’s goal is to enhance our knowledge of the complex disease processes underlying SVD using machine learning and integrating individual imaging and genetic data from over 20,000 adults. By understanding these disease processes, we can design novel methods to more effectively treat and prevent stroke and dementia.",Integrating Machine Learning and Genomic Approaches to Understand

"Dissecting the pathogenesis and outcomes of PSC using multi-omics by studying the exposome and genome PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The major goal of this RC2 proposal is to generate the first, multi-omics translational study capturing the sum of environmental exposures (i.e. the exposome) and comprehensive data resource for Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC), a chronic, progressive liver disease without effective medical therapy. PSC shortens survival, is associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and strongly predisposes to cholangiocarcinoma (i.e. bile duct cancer) and colon cancer. Our recent genome wide association studies (GWAS) revealed the significant role of genetic variation in PSC, while also re-emphasizing the importance of environmental factors and gene-environment interactions in PSC pathogenesis. To further elucidate the role of exposures from our external environment and lifestyle (e.g., diet, stress, toxins, drugs, microbes), we have assembled a world-class, multi-disciplinary team that synergizes expertise and resources across four institutions: Mayo Clinic, Emory University, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), and University of Oslo, Norway. Our collaborative team will leverage large clinical databases and biorepositories, as well as expertise in PSC and related conditions, exposomics, metabolomics, methylomics, transcriptomics, metagenomics, genomics, and data analytics to develop the PSC Scientific Community Resource for hypothesis-generating science and simultaneously uncover factors contributing to PSC.  We now seek to define the bigger-picture cellular networks, rather than individual genes, driving disease processes. To do so, we will use unbiased network-based approaches designed to integrate multiple layers of omics data. Our proposal is predicated on the hypothesis that multi-omics analyses of data capturing environmental exposures and the associated biological responses, including the effect on the genome, will reveal networks or pathways influencing PSC pathogenesis and outcomes. To test this hypothesis, we will perform a series of sophisticated analyses to identify PSC-associated changes in and across the exposome, metabolome, methylome, and transcriptome in blood as well as the gut metagenome, exposome and metabolome.  Our collaboration and data generation are already underway with pilot studies demonstrating differences in blood exposomes and metabolomes and stool metagenomes between PSC patients and controls. Using a suite of bioinformatic tools and available genetic variation data, we aim to discover stable, detectable, omics-based disease signatures in blood (Aim 1) and stool (Aim 2) that when integrated with clinical data (Aim 3) will reveal biological pathways driving disease pathogenesis and outcomes. All data, residual specimens, and analytical details will be made freely available to the research community in accordance with NIDDK's mission. Furthermore, this effort responds to the NIDDK's call “to better understand the role of the microbiome, genetics, and exposome.” PROJECT NARRATIVE We seek to generate the first, multi-omics translational study and comprehensive data resource for Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC), a chronic, progressive liver disease without medical therapy.

"Using clinical data to identify FDA-approved drugs for cancer prevention and therapeutic repurposing Project Summary/Abstract Clinical data collection is accelerating rapidly, and in the future it will include both provider- and patient- generated data. Hidden within this mass of noisy observational data are clues as to factors influencing disease onset and outcome. Finding ways to exploit this trove of disease data can unlock a new perspective on disease processes. We can tackle disease both from the bottom-up, from experimental data generated in the laboratory, and from the top down, from clinical phenomena observed across human populations. A particularly impactful and prevalent disease is cancer. Each tumor harbors a unique combination of mutations driving a distinct set of oncogenic processes. Targeted therapies have been proposed to pinpoint these mutations, potentially requiring a vast array of therapeutic options. Cancer treatment often fails when drug resistance arises, another result of the complex combinatorial nature of tumor alterations. Combination therapies have been proposed as an approach to interfere with multiple disease signals simultaneously. However, identifying effective drug combinations, and the cancer types in which they are effective, is experimentally infeasible, leading to a push for computational solutions. In this proposal, we combine methods from social sciences and biostatistics to find the causal effect of a drug on cancer onset from observational clinical data. Both increased and decreased cancer rates in drug-takers are of equal interest, as they can inform us of disease processes and provide clinical impact. We are particularly interested in finding drug combinations that impact cancer. These combination effects are unlikely to have been detected, and our clinical data provides a unique resource for observing the effects of tens of thousands of drug combinations. We will pool the resulting causal drug effect estimates across the many cancers present in our data. To gain insight into the cellular processes underlying clinical effect, we will examine the impact of known cancer-causing drugs in vitro, using large public cell line assays. The accompanying goal is to provide Dr. Rachel Melamed with a career development experience to become an independent scientist. Her research will use observational health data to understand the genesis of cancer, prevent the disease, and discover new therapeutic options. This proposal takes advantage of the interdisciplinary strengths of the University of Chicago in computation, biostatistics, and medicine, as well as institutional resources in terms of data access and infrastructure. Dr. Melamed has assembled a team consisting of complementary mentors and collaborators with expertise in computation, statistics, translational medicine, personalized therapy, and cancer therapy. The career development plan focuses on enhancing her statistics and machine learning skills with structured coursework and mentorship, and gaining experience in biomedical applications via applied work and mentorship. This will provide Dr. Melamed with skills to model observational data and to integrate the results with experimental data. Project Narrative Clinical data has been shown to hold patterns relating drugs to cancer onset. Using this data to find drugs that increase cancer rates will provide insight into the disease and an opportunity for preventing some cancer cases.

"Role of State Medicaid Policies in Improving Access to Dental Care among Low-Income Adults PROJECT SUMMARY The purpose of this study is to examine how access to dental care among low-income adults is impacted by state Medicaid policies regarding eligibility, dental coverage, cost-sharing and dentist reimbursement. Oral health is integral to overall health, economic productivity and well-being. Yet access to dental care continues to be a major public health problem for low-income adults, leading to untreated disease, pain, poor systemic health and substantial economic burden. In recent years, several policy changes under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) such as Medicaid expansion and dependent care coverage could significantly impact access to dental care among the poor non-elderly adults. In addition, there is extensive cross-state variation in terms of dental benefits covered for Medicaid adults. These variations provide natural experiments to examine the effect of Medicaid policies on access to dental care. Moreover, under the current health reform discussions, state Medicaid programs are anticipated to gain autonomy in resource allocation, yet may receive significantly less federal funding, making the need for robust evidence on relative effectiveness of Medicaid policy alternatives available to the states paramount. The overarching goal of this application is to advance the research career of the candidate (Dr. Singhal) by protecting her time for training and research on these critical issues in oral health policy. This goal will be accomplished through additional training in complementary disciplines of econometrics and machine learning, and their application to estimate the impacts of Medicaid coverage and payment generosities on access to dental care. The project brings together complementary secondary data from multiple sources including: large national survey data (National Health Interview Survey), administrative enrollment and claims data (Medicaid Analytic eXtract) and linked survey and claims data. Leveraging these data and training resources, this project will: 1) develop synthetic indices of Medicaid dental coverage and payment generosities; 2) estimate the effect of each policy alternative and combined generosity indices on various measures of access to dental care; and 3) predict the relative effectiveness of policy alternatives and their combinations on access to dental care. We will use econometric methods including instrumental variables, difference-in-difference and regression discontinuity models to develop the generosity indices and to estimate the impact of Medicaid generosity. To develop and validate the predictive model, we will use supervised machine learning approaches (e.g. decision tree learning) using linked survey and claims data. The results will provide evidence needed to inform future strategies to ensure efficient use of health care resources to reduce oral health disparities. The completion of this project will also enable Dr. Singhal to establish a research program as an independent research investigator with support from her multi-disciplinary mentoring and advising teams and the vibrant research community at Boston University. PROJECT NARRATIVE Access to dental care is a major public health problem among low-income adults, as evidenced by declining rates of dental care utilization, high unmet dental need, and the increasing rate of emergency department visits for dental problems by this vulnerable population. The research plan of this career development award aims to: 1) examine how state Medicaid policies regarding eligibility, coverage and dentist reimbursement impact access to dental care among low-income adults, and 2) develop a model to predict the impact of hypothetical policy changes. A clearer understanding of the relative effectiveness of policy alternatives available to states is critical to ensuring the efficient use of healthcare resources and achieving NIDCR’s strategic goal to reduce income-based disparities in access to and outcomes of oral health care services.",Role of State Medicaid Policies in Improving Access to Dental Care among Low-Income Adults,9724447,K08DE027720,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Boston ', ' Communities ', ' Cost Containment ', ' Cost Control ', ' dental service ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' Dental Care ', ' Dental Health Services ', ' Dentists ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Economics ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Environment ', ' Expenditure ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' Health Services ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Services Research ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' indexing ', ' Low Income Population ', ' Medicaid ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' dental health ', ' Oral health ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' pressure ', ' Production ', ' Productivity ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Policy ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Measures ', ' Cost Sharing ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Resource Allocation ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' career ', ' population survey ', ' improved ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Medical ', ' Health Care Reform ', ' Healthcare Reform ', ' Health Reform ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Dental ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Policies ', ' Development Plans ', ' Funding ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Structure ', ' payment ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Economic Burden ', ' Improve Access ', ' National Health Interview Survey ', ' National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research ', ' National Institute of Dental Research ', ' NIDR ', ' NIDCR ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' cost ', ' health economics ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Natural experiment ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' evidence base ', ' population health ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' Affordable Care Act ', ' Obamacare ', ' health care service ', ' healthcare service ', ' relative effectiveness ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' decision tree learning ', ' econometrics ', ' ']",NIDCR,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,K08,2019,130717,MA-07,0.002198622639929274
"Precision Medicine by Targeting Cell Adhesion in Melanoma PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In the proposed research, we address a problem that is common not just to melanoma, but also to other forms of cancer, such as prostate cancer, and that has been widely discussed recently. While we as dermatologists encourage patients to undergo skin cancer screening exams to detect melanoma early, it remains challenging to differentiate the truly aggressive from the indolent or nonclinical pigmented lesions. This is true even after a melanoma has been biopsied and examined under the microscope. As a result, there is massive over-diagnosis and overtreatment, specifically with respect to sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsies, that is costly, has side effects, requires precious hospital infrastructure and induces substantial patient anxiety. Surprisingly, and despite decades of research on cancer, assessment of metastasis risk in primary cutaneous melanoma continues to be based primarily on tumor invasion depth (also referred to Breslow depth), a method that was introduced 45 years go. While Breslow depth tends to work well at the extreme ends of the spectrum, most melanomas fall into a grey zone where Breslow depth with or without additional tissue-derived and clinical variables (such as patient age) does not predict the true biology of melanoma well. Breslow depth continues to be popular because alternative methods, including molecular-based methods, are either ineffective, have not been appropriately validated or lack a strong biological rationale. This in turn inhibits the development of new and innovative therapies. Here we will study a method that quantifies changes in integrin-linked cell adhesion to better differentiate high-risk (defined as SLN positive melanoma) from biologically indolent melanoma. First, we will study consecutive cases of cutaneous melanoma from across the United States and Europe and correlate a molecular profile of cell adhesion with SLN status. Second, we will study how the inhibition of certain aspects of integrin adhesion affects melanoma growth and metastasis in vivo. We expect that our research will validate methods to identify high-risk melanoma that outperform the standard of care, reduce the rate of unnecessary SLN procedures and identify patients with high-risk melanoma overlooked by current procedures. Moreover, a better understanding of the molecular machinery that drives metastasis will create new therapeutic opportunities. The candidate’s long term goal is discover novel characteristics of malignant melanocytes that enable the development of new and innovative diagnostic methods and therapies. The mentored career development award will help the candidate acquire new methodological, professional and leadership skills to independently, successfully and meaningfully contribute to the fields of cell adhesion/cancer/melanoma research in the years to come. Specifically, the plan is to pursue the following training activities: 1.) Acquire expertise in studying melanoma using mouse models; use these models to test and optimize drugs and drugs combinations. 2.) Acquire experience in interpreting the histological features of melanoma; broaden my understanding of the biological concepts used by dermatopathologists to characterize melanoma. 3.) Acquire expertise in designing diagnostic biomarker studies; learn statistical methods, specifically methods that can be used to analyze complex datasets. 4.) Build the professional and leadership skills to bring together and lead an international consortium of melanoma investigators. The candidate will be mentored by a team of national experts in the field of cancer research. Mentoring and research will be carried out at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN. Mayo Clinic offers core facility services for all mainstream standardized biomedical research methods. This includes tissue archives and bio-banking, animal housing and animal care, optical imaging, including high-end confocal microscopes, all methods related to histology, including RNA and DNA in-situ hybridization, targeted gene expression-based methods including microfluidic Fluidigm technology, and all mainstream ‘omics’ methods. All services are fully staffed with trained technicians. Moreover, there is scientific staff available to trouble-shoot experiments. These resources are all within walking distance from the candidate’s laboratory. Moreover, Mayo Clinic has a large staff of medical indexers, software programmers, application specialist and bio-information scientists. Because of the size of the clinic, there are medical specialists and subspecialists on hand for all areas of medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE While dermatologists encourage patients to undergo skin cancer screening exams to detect melanoma early, it remains challenging to differentiate the truly aggressive from the indolent pigmented lesion.

"Niche signals in HSC genesis PROJECT SUMMARY Hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) have well established clinical applications in the treatment of heritable and acquired blood disorders. However, their therapeutic potential could be significantly broadened by engineering novel methods to generate HSC de novo from pluripotent stem cells or from directly reprogrammed adult cells. Toward this goal, we have established endothelial cell (EC) niche based culture methods that provide the necessary conditions to support the specification and self-renewal of HSC from embryonic hemogenic precursors, and more recently, from adult ECs using transcription factor (TF)-mediated conversion that bypasses a pluripotent intermediate. We hypothesize that recreating the signals necessary and sufficient to develop a clinically meaningful system for HSC generation in vitro will necessitate a comprehensive, systems approach to deconstruct the niche provided signals required for HSC specification and self-renewal. Thus, the overall goal of this grant is to leverage unique expertise of the collaborating laboratories to elucidate the signaling interactions regulating HSC specification and self-renewal from embryonic hemogenic precursors or TF-reprogrammed adult EC in the context of the EC niche. Our approach consists of three overlapping aims. The first aim will identify EC niche-provided signals necessary for embryonic HSC specification and self-renewal. The second aim will identify the unique HSC programs induced by these signals that regulate the transition from embryonic hemogenic precursor to bone fide repopulating HSC. The third will identify comparable programs that regulate the transition from adult EC to HSC during TF-mediated reprogramming in the EC niche. Key to these studies will be innovative functional assays, transcriptional profiling methods, and computational approaches that will enable us to resolve cellular complexity of niche cells and their interactions with developing embryonic or reprogrammed HSC at the single cell level. The role of identified signal factors in stage-specific support of HSC specification will be validated and further refined in vitro by gain and loss of function studies in the context of niche EC. Furthermore, to extend these studies to stromal cell-free systems as a step toward clinical translation, we will also test the contribution of identified signal factors in HSC specification and self-renewal in the context of stage-specific modulation of Notch activation using engineered Notch agonists. To achieve the goals of this proposal, we have developed a multidisciplinary collaboration involving unique expertise in each of our laboratories, including basic HSC and EC niche cell biology, direct TF based cellular conversion, clinical HSC transplantation, genome wide assessment of rare stem cell populations at single cell resolution, and innovative computational approaches to deconstruct core signal pathways regulating developmental transitions. Altogether, we expect the proposed studies will ultimately guide the design of novel strategies for deriving and expanding HSC in vitro for therapeutic applications. NARRATIVE Hematopoietic stem cells are currently used in the treatment and cure of a variety of blood disorders. Methods to generate new or greater numbers of hematopoietic stem cells in the laboratory could expand the availability and therapeutic applications of these valuable cells, but currently such methods are lacking. The goal of this proposal is to use lessons from endothelial cells, which provide critical signals to support hematopoietic stem cells, to engineer novel systems for the development and expansion of hematopoietic stem cells in culture. !",Niche signals in HSC genesis,9736697,RC2DK114777,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Aorta ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' blastomere structure ', ' Embryonic Cell ', ' Blastocytes ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' bone ', ' cell culture ', ' Cell Culture Techniques ', ' Cellfree System ', ' Cell-Free System ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Embryonic ', ' Embryo ', ' Embryogenesis ', ' Embryo Development ', ' Embryonic Development ', ' Engineering ', ' Goals ', ' gonads ', ' gonad ', ' Gonadal structure ', ' Grant ', ' blood disorder ', ' Hematological Disorder ', ' Hematologic Diseases ', ' Blood Diseases ', ' Hematological Disease ', ' hemopoietic stem cell ', ' hemopoietic progenitor ', ' hematopoietic stem progenitor cell ', ' hematopoietic progenitor ', ' blood stem cell ', ' Hematopoietic Progenitor Cells ', ' Blood Precursor Cell ', ' Hematopoietic stem cells ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' In Vitro ', ' indexing ', ' Laboratories ', ' Wolffian Body ', ' Mesonephros ', ' Mesonephric structure ', ' Methods ', ' Physiologic Processes ', ' Organismal Process ', ' Organism-Level Process ', ' Physiological Processes ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' transcription factor ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' Generations ', ' notch receptors ', ' notch ', ' notch protein ', ' Mediating ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Stromal Cells ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Endothelial Cells ', ' insight ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation ', ' Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant ', ' HSC transplantation ', ' Agonist ', ' Coculture Techniques ', ' Coculture ', ' Cocultivation ', ' Co-culture ', ' Therapeutic ', ' programs ', ' Cellular biology ', ' cell biology ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' embryonic stem cell ', ' stem cell of embryonic origin ', ' ES cell ', ' receptor ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' novel ', ' Sorting - Cell Movement ', ' sorting ', ' Bypass ', ' Gene Expression Profiling ', ' transcriptional profiling ', ' gene expression assay ', ' gene expression analysis ', ' Transcript Expression Analysis ', ' Transcript Expression Analyses ', ' Gene Expression Pattern Analysis ', ' Gene Expression Monitoring ', ' Pluripotent Stem Cells ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Address ', ' Molecular Analysis ', ' Resolution ', ' Stem Cell Development ', ' in vivo ', ' Signaling Molecule ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Heritability ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' loss of function ', ' self-renewal ', ' self-renew ', ' stem ', ' genome-wide ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' stem cell population ', ' Systems Development ', ' clinical translation ', ' single-cell RNA sequencing ', ' single cell RNA-seq ', ' scRNA-seq ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' hematopoietic stem cell expansion ', ' blood stem cell expansion ', ' HSC expansion ', ' hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal ', ' hematopoietic stem cell regeneration ', ' HSC self-renewal ', ' HSC regeneration ', ' Hematopoietic Stem Cell Specification ', ' HSC Specification ', ' ']",NIDDK,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,RC2,2019,642675,WA-07,-0.003953525454029172
"HERCULES: Exposome Research Center PROJECT SUMMARY: HERCULES The vision of the HERCULES P30 is to demonstrably advance the role of environmental health sciences in clinical and public health settings using the platform of the exposome. Healthcare and biomedical research have become increasingly genome-centric. While much of this is due to the impressive achievements in genomics, which have consistently outpaced gains in environmental health, it is our contention that a more persuasive case needs to be made for environmental factors. Science and intuition support the idea that the environment plays just as large of a role as genetics for the majority of diseases. The exposome, which embraces a strategy and scale similar to genomic research, is poised to elevate the environment in discussions of health and disease. We will continue to grow and enhance the environmental health science research portfolio at Emory through cutting-edge technologies and innovative data solutions. We will build upon the superb relationships we have built with the local community and continue to push the mission of NIEHS on campus and across the scientific landscape. Based on the extraordinary progress over our first three years, we propose to retain our theme to use exposome-related concepts and approaches to improve human health. This simple and unifying vision will continue to stimulate discovery, promote collaboration, and enhance communication through the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. To marshal physical and intellectual resources to support exposome-related approaches (high-resolution metabolomics, analytical chemistry, systems biology, machine learning, bioinformatics, high-throughput toxicology, and spatial and temporal statistical models) through cores, pilot funding, mentoring, and research forums. Specific Aim 2. To make major contributions towards exposome and environmental health science research. Specific Aim 3. To provide career development activities around innovative and emerging concepts and approaches related to the exposome. Specific Aim 4. To enhance and expand existing relationships with community partners to resolve environmental health issues in the community using exposome principles. Specific Aim 5. To provide infrastructure and resources to facilitate rapid translation of novel scientific findings into the development of prevention and treatment strategies in humans. Pursuit of HERCULES' aims will advance environmental health sciences within our institutions and in the scientific community.

"Reactome: An Open Knowledgebase of Human Pathways Project Summary  We seek renewal of the core operating funding for the Reactome Knowledgebase of Human Biological Pathways and Processes. Reactome is a curated, open access biomolecular pathway database that can be freely used and redistributed by all members of the biological research community. It is used by clinicians, geneti- cists, genomics researchers, and molecular biologists to interpret the results of high-throughput experimental studies, by bioinformaticians seeking to develop novel algorithms for mining knowledge from genomic studies, and by systems biologists building predictive models of normal and disease variant pathways.  Our curators, PhD-level scientists with backgrounds in cell and molecular biology work closely with in- dependent investigators within the community to assemble machine-readable descriptions of human biological pathways. Each pathway is extensively checked and peer-reviewed prior to publication to ensure its assertions are backed up by the primary literature, and that human molecular events inferred from orthologous ones in animal models have an auditable inference chain. Curated Reactome pathways currently cover 8930 protein- coding genes (44% of the translated portion of the genome) and ~150 RNA genes. We also offer a network of reliable ‘functional interactions’ (FIs) predicted by a conservative machine-learning approach, which covers an additional 3300 genes, for a combined coverage of roughly 60% of the known genome.  Over the next five years, we will: (1) curate new macromolecular entities, clinically significant protein sequence variants and isoforms, and drug-like molecules, and the complexes these entities form, into new reac- tions; (2) supplement normal pathways with alternative pathways targeted to significant diseases and devel- opmental biology; (3) expand and automate our tools for curation, management and community annotation; (4) integrate pathway modeling technologies using probabilistic graphical models and Boolean networks for pathway and network perturbation studies; (5) develop additional compelling software interfaces directed at both computational and lab biologist users; and (6) and improve outreach to bioinformaticians, molecular bi- ologists and clinical researchers.

"C-PAC: A configurable, compute-optimized, cloud-enabled neuroimaging analysis software for reproducible translational and comparative ABSTRACT The BRAIN Initiative is designed to leverage sophisticated neuromodulation, electrophysiological recording, and macroscale neuroimaging techniques in human and non-human animal models in order to develop a multilevel understanding of human brain function. However, the necessary tools for organizing, processing and analyzing neuroimaging data generated through these efforts are not widely available as coherent and easy-to- use software packages. Gaps are particularly apparent for nonhuman data (i.e., monkey, rodent), as most of the existing processing and analytic software packages are specifically designed for human imaging. Methods have been proposed for addressing the challenges inherent to the processing of nonhuman data (e.g., brain extraction, tissue segmentation, spatial normalization, brain parcellation, temporal denoising); to date, these have not been readily integrated into an easy-to-use, robust, and reproducible analysis package. Similarly, many of the sophisticated machine learning and modeling methods developed for neuroimaging analyses are inaccessible to most researchers because they have not been integrated into easy-to-use pipeline software. As a result, translational and comparative neuroimaging researchers patch together neuroinformatics pipelines that use various combinations of disparate software packages and in-house code. We propose to extend the Configurable Pipeline for the Analysis of Connectomes (C-PAC) open-source software to provide robust and reproducible pipelines for functional and structural MRI data. We will integrate the various disparate image processing and analysis methods used to handle the challenges of nonhuman imaging data, into a single, open source, configurable, easy-to-use end-to-end analysis pipeline package that is accessible locally or via the cloud. The end product will not only improve the quality, transparency and reproducibility of nonhuman translational and comparative imaging, but also enable new avenues of scientific inquiry through our inclusion of methods that are yet to be applied to nonhuman imaging data (e.g., gradient- based cortical parcellation methods, hyperalignment). Specific aims of the proposed work include to: 1) Integrate neuroimaging processing and analysis methods optimized for BRAIN Initiative data, 2) Implement strategies for carrying out comparative studies of human and non-human populations, and 3) Extend C-PAC to include cutting-edge analytical strategies for identifying mechanisms of brain function. All development will occur “in the open” using GitHub and other collaborative tools to maximally involve participation in the C-PAC project. Annual hackathons will be held to collaborate with investigators from BRAIN Initiative awards and other neuroinformatics development projects to integrate their tools with C-PAC. Hands-on training will be held to train investigators on optimal use of the newly developed tools.

"Development of Machine Learning Algorithms to Assess and Train Vesico-Urethral Anastomosis during Robot Assisted Radical Prostatectomy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT CANDIDATE (Andrew J. Hung, MD): My long-term goal is to establish a career in innovating training methods for robotic surgery which will lead to curtailing surgeon learning curve, and maximize patient safety. My first step towards that goal focuses on understanding objective metrics that measure surgeon performance, and how machine learning algorithms can process that data to guide training. I have developed a career development program that builds on my clinical training in robotic urologic surgery and prior research in surgical training. Through mentorship, a fellowship, and formal coursework, this K23 award will provide me the necessary support to develop expertise in 3 areas where I do not have formal training, yet are critical to my success: (1) Machine learning; (2) Surgical education; (3) Advanced statistical skills and study design. MENTORING TEAM: My career development and research plans leverage existing institutional resources, including the USC Machine Learning Center, led by co-primary mentor Dr. Yan Liu; and Keck Hospital of USC, the second busiest robotic center by volume in the United States and the USC Institute of Urology (led by co- primary mentor and chairman Dr. Inderbir Gill), home to pioneers of several urologic surgical techniques with a robust research apparatus supporting several NIH-funded clinical scientists. My mentoring team is complemented by co-mentor Dr. Robert Sweet, a DOD-funded expert on surgical education; career mentor Dr. Larissa Rodriguez, a federally funded clinician/scientist experienced in mentoring K awardees; educational psychology collaborator Dr. Kenneth Yates, an authority on cognitive task analysis; and consultant Dr. Anthony Jarc, at Intuitive Surgical who has supported much of the pilot data on objective performance metrics. The proposed K23 work truly requires the robust collaboration of experts in robotic surgery, education, and machine learning. RESEARCH: The learning curve for surgeons performing robot assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) is steep: over 100 cases. Current ‘gold standard’ methods of surgical assessment rely on subjective expert review, but such evaluations are time consuming and inconsistent. Nonetheless, credentialing a surgeon to perform robotic surgery has enormous implications - patient outcomes are at risk, and a surgeon’s career is on the line. Informed by my clinical expertise in robotic urological surgery and preliminary data, I will develop a novel method of utilizing machine learning (ML) algorithms to objectively assess robotic surgeon performance and to guide training for the vesico-urethral anastomosis (VUA), the most critical reconstructive part of the robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). I will develop and validate objective metrics directly captured from the da Vinci robot during the VUA (Aim 1), train machine learning algorithms to assess a surgeon’s performance of VUA (Aim 2), and utilize ML algorithms to guide surgeons learning the VUA (Aim 3). Armed with these data and skills from this award, I will be uniquely suited to utilize machine learning to generalize objective surgeon assessment for robot-assisted surgical procedures within and beyond urology. Finally, the results from this study will provide preliminary data for independent funding through mechanisms such as an NIH R01 grant. PROJECT NARRATIVE The learning curve for surgeons performing robot assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) for prostate cancer is steep, and current methods of evaluating surgeons require subjective and time-consuming expert review.

"Functional and transcriptional analysis of embryonic hematopoietic stem cell development at the single cell level PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The therapeutic potential of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) could be significantly enhanced by methods to generate HSC de novo from pluripotent stem cells (PSC) or reprogrammed adult cells. Thus, there has been great interest in understanding the embryologic origin of HSC and the signal pathways that guide HSC development and self-renewal, such that the process of HSC genesis can be recapitulated in vitro, a goal which has yet to be realized. Given the heterogeneity and developmental asynchrony in hemogenic precursors during their emergence in the embryo, to achieve this it will be necessary to develop better strategies to isolate and characterize the rare precursors capable of giving rise to HSC and to understand the signals that drive their development to functional, engrafting HSC. To this end, I have established that endothelial cells (EC) derived from the aorta-gonad-mesonephros region (AGM), the niche in which the first HSC emerge, can promote the in vitro specification and self-renewal of engrafting HSC from hemogenic precursors, including recent studies at the single cell level. Furthermore, I have shown that the Notch pathway functions in both specification and self-renewal of HSC in the EC niche, and that use of immobilized Notch ligands to activate the Notch pathway, along with hematopoietic cytokines, is sufficient to induce expansion of embryonic HSC. Building upon this work, the goals of this proposal are to utilize this novel in vitro AGM-EC system to elucidate the phenotypic, molecular, and functional properties of HSC precursors as they transition to functional HSC capable of long-term, multilineage engraftment. This will require isolation and functional characterization of HSC precursors across different stages of their development at the single cell level (Aim 1), followed by single cell transcriptional analysis to determine the gene regulatory networks and molecular signals promoting their development to functional HSC (Aim 2A). In studies working toward the engineering of stromal cell-free systems for HSC generation, agonists of identified signaling pathways will be functionally tested for their capacity to support HSC development in conjunction with the known requirement for Notch signaling activation (Aim 2B). Altogether, these studies will provide novel insight into the unique properties of HSC precursors, as well at the signaling mechanisms governing their maturation to functional HSC, which will have important implications in advancing our ability to generate HSC from PSC. To accomplish these aims, I will leverage the wealth of resources available in the mentoring laboratory of Dr. Bernstein, as well as key resources available at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, the University of Washington, and Seattle Children’s Hospital, and opportunities for co-mentorship from Dr. Shahin Rafii at the Ansary Stem Cell Institute at Weill Cornell Medical College. A key aspect of my career development plan is to also acquire new skills that will facilitate my research objectives, including techniques in single cell RNA-seq and bioinformatics analysis which will be performed in collaboration with and under the co-mentorship of Dr. Cole Trapnell in Genome Sciences at the University of Washington. This type of interdisciplinary training will provide me with the tools necessary to apply innovative technologies in unravelling the complexity of niche- stem cell interactions that instruct HSC fates. My research experience studying hematopoietic stem cell development has provided me with a strong background to facilitate success in the proposed research goals. My clinical experience in caring for children undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has cemented a strong passion to expand scientific knowledge of HSC and translate this knowledge to improve therapies for children with hematologic, immunologic, and oncologic diseases. Success in my research and career development goals outlined in this proposal will enable me to establish an independent academic career as a physician-scientist with the skills to lead a diverse research team and collaborate broadly to address essential questions in stem cell biology. Ultimately, my long-term goal is to develop a laboratory-based career with focus on taking fundamental principles discovered through basic research in developmental HSC biology toward clinical applications in hematopoietic stem cell therapeutics.

"Knowledge Management Center for Illuminating the Druggable Genome SUMMARY The understudied protein targets that are the focus of the implementation phase of the Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) project need to be placed in the contexts of gene-sets/pathways, drugs/small-molecules, diseases/phenotypes, and cells/tissues. By extending our previous methods, we will impute knowledge about the understudied potential target protein kinases, GPCRs, and ion channels listed in the RFA using machine learning strategies. To establish this classification system, we will organize data from many omics- and literature- based resources into attribute tables where genes are the rows and their attributes are the columns. Examples of such attribute tables include gene or protein expression in cancer cell lines (CCLE) or human tissues (GTEx), changes in expression in response to drug perturbations or single-gene knockdowns (LINCS), regulation by transcription factors based on ChIP-seq data (ENCODE), and phenotypes in mice observed when single genes are knocked out (KOMP). In total, we will process and abstract data from over 100 resources. We will then predict target functions, target association with pathways, small-molecules/drugs that modulate the activity and expression of the target, and target relevance to human disease. To further validate such predictions, we will employ text mining to identify knowledge that corroborates with the data mining predictions, perform molecular docking of predicted small molecules using homology modeling, and seek associations between variants and human diseases by mining electronic medical records (EMR) together with genomic profiling of thousands of patients. In addition, we will develop innovative data visualization tools to allow users to interact with all the collected data, and develop social networking software to build communities centered around proteins/genes/targets as well as biological topics including pathways, cell types, drugs/small-molecules, and diseases. Overall, we will develop an invaluable resource that will accelerate target and drug discovery.

"Pharmaco Response Signatures and Disease Mechanism DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the HMS LINCS Center is to delineate the fundamental principles of cellular response to perturbagens at the level of single-cells and cell populations and to make response data routinely available via web-based browse, query and programmatic interfaces. This will involve the development and testing of new measurement methods, computational algorithms, and response signatures for diverse human cell types exposed to perturbations individually and in combination. We will emphasize the systematic collection of data not currently available in existing public databases including live and fixed-cell imaging, biochemical data on signaling proteins and multi-factorial drug-response phenotypes. A focus on diverse transformed and primary cells, including those derived from healthy and diseased donors, and on clinical grade small molecules (kinase inhibitors and epigenome drugs) will increase the translational impact of our work. The proposed LINCS Center represents a continuation of a program in operation for ~3.5 years under a LINCS pilot phase U54 award. We will expand the scope and sophistication of our Center, devoting  significant effort to (i) improving the quality of data analysis and visualization, particularly wih respect to the  complexities of perturbagen polypharmacy (ii) accelerating the release of perturbagen-response signatures  using methods that have been demonstrated to yield reliable and informative data, with a particular  emphasis on primary and non-transformed cells (iii) developing and applying new measurement methods,  particularly mass spectrometry for analysis of cell populations and live-cell imaging for analysis of single cells.  The work will involve nine complementary but independent aims. In Data Generation, Aim 1 will perform systematic analysis of perturbagen responses at a single-cell level. Aim 2 will collect multiplex protein and mRNA data on perturbagen response using a set of complementary imaging, mass spectrometry and bead-based assays. Aim 3 will apply LINCS methods to non-transformed immune cells and induced pluripotent stem cells, and explore if signatures can guide a detailed medicinal chemistry campaign. In Data Analysis, Aim 4 will construct perturbagen-response signatures using statistical modeling, network inference and machine learning methods. Aim 5 will develop new approaches to understanding and analyzing drug interactions on multiple phenotypes in single cells. Aim 6 will develop a novel compressed sensing framework for analyzing the poly-pharmacology of kinase inhibitors. Aim 7 will enhance the query, browse and explore functions of the HMS LINCS website and database and its integration with the UCSC Genome Browser. In Community Interaction and Outreach, Aim 8 will implement diverse training and outreach activities, including collaboration with LINCS and non-LINCS research groups. In Administration, Aim 9 will ensure effective management of the Center, sustained access to tools and data produced within the LINCS Project, and compliance with program goals. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Disease networks are complex interactions between multiple proteins. Precise understanding of the multifactorial perturbations imposed on multi-component networks is a crucial step in the development of a rational approach to drug discovery and personalization of therapy.

"A BRAIN Initiative Resource: The Neuroscience Multi-omic Data Archive Project Summary The Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative promotes the development and application of technologies to describe the temporal and spatial dynamics of cell types and neural circuits in the brain. The Principal Investigator, senior personnel and staff of this project have diverse expertise required to marshall data across the BRAIN Initiative consortium, including experience in data collection from multiple institutions, large-scale quality control and analysis processing capability, familiarity with NIH policy and public archive deposition strategies. To promote smooth interactions across a large research consortium, we will develop the Neuroscience Multi-Omic Archive (NeMO Archive), a data repository that is specifically focused on the storage and dissemination of omic data from the BRAIN Initiative and related brain research projects. We will utilize a federated model for data storage such that the physical location of data can be distributed between the NeMO local file system, public repositories, and a cloud-based storage system (e.g. Amazon S3). We will leverage this capability and distribute BRAIN Initiative data between our local filesystem and the cloud. The Nemo Archive will be a data resource consistent with the principles advanced by research community members who are launching resources in next generation NIH data ecosystem. These practices include FAIR Principles, documentation of APIs, data-indexing systems, workflow sharing, use of shareable software pipelines and storage on cloud-based systems. The information incorporating into the NeMO archive will, in part, enable understanding of 1) genomic regions associated with brain abnormalities and disease; 2) transcription factor binding sites and other regulatory elements; 3) transcription activity; 4) levels of cytosine modification; and 5) histone modification profiles and chromatin accessibility. It will enable users to answer diverse questions of relevance to brain research, such as identifying diagnostic candidates, predicting prognosis, selecting treatments, and testing hypotheses. It will also provide the basic knowledge to guide the development and execution of predictive and machine learning algorithms in the future.   Project Narrative The Neuroscience Multi-Omic Archive (NeMO Archive) is a data repository that is specifically focused on the storage and dissemination of omic data from the BRAIN Initiative and related brain research projects.",A BRAIN Initiative Resource: The Neuroscience Multi-omic Data Archive,9748608,R24MH114788,"['Archives ', ' Atlases ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Combining Site ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Chromatin ', ' Communities ', ' Cytosine ', ' Data Collection ', ' Elements ', ' Future ', ' indexing ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Patients ', ' Personnel Staffing ', ' Phenotype ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Quality Control ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Running ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Standardization ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' transcription factor ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Ecosystem ', ' Ecological Systems ', ' Ecologic Systems ', ' Imagery ', ' Visualization ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Ensure ', ' Ingestion ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Policies ', ' Data Storage and Retrieval ', ' data storage ', ' data retrieval ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Internet ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Deposition ', ' Deposit ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' cell type ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Services ', ' data management ', ' experience ', ' Familiarity ', ' member ', ' neural circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' Modeling ', ' repository ', ' Documentation ', ' complex R ', ' cis-(Rh(biq)2Cl2)Cl ', "" Rh (2,2'-biquinoline) complex "", ' histone modification ', ' data processing ', ' computerized data processing ', ' Institution ', ' Data ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Genomic Segment ', ' genomic region ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Process ', ' Docking ', ' Modification ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Metadata ', ' meta data ', ' working group ', ' work group ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' data integration ', ' Data Coordinating Center ', ' Data Coordination Center ', ' next generation ', ' Visualization software ', ' visualization tool ', ' Bioconductor ', ' brain research ', ' database structure ', ' data base structure ', ' operation ', ' cloud based ', ' data visualization ', ' multiple omics ', ' multiomics ', ' data archive ', ' brain abnormalities ', ' online resource ', ' web-based resource ', ' web resource ', ' online compendium ', ' on-line resource ', ' on-line compendium ', ' internet resource ', ' cloud storage ', ' cloud-based storage ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' data resource ', ' innovative neurotechnologies ', ' data warehouse ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Banks ', ' data submission ', ' data deposition ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' analysis pipeline ', ' Data Management Resources ', ' Multiomic Data ', ' multiple omic data ', ' data pipeline ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R24,2019,1263611,MD-07,-0.02155119663253706
"Systems biology frameworks to unravel mechanisms driving complex disorders Project Summary/Abstract This application proposes a training program to integrate the PI, Dr. Varadan's previous research efforts in informatics and machine learning into investigations pertaining to the etiology and progression of Barrett's Esophagus, a gastrointestinal disorder of significant public health interest. Much of Dr. Varadan's previous research has involved developing intelligent algorithms and informatics approaches to decode the interconnections within complex biological systems, with only a basic understanding of the clinical needs and complexities involved in translational research. The proposed project would provide a broad and in-depth mentored experience focused on clinical and biological aspects of Barrett's Esophagus, as well as added knowledge in the use of preclinical model systems to investigate biological mechanisms. The overall goal is to expand the PI's experience and training in the design and conduct of translational studies focused on gastrointestinal (GI) diseases. This objective will be achieved through a combination of didactic and research activities conducted under an exceptional mentoring team of translational researchers at Case Western Reserve University, spanning achievements across clinical management of GI disorders, molecular genetics and inflammatory processes associated with diseases of the gut. Accordingly, this proposal leverages Dr. Varadan's computational background to address an urgent and unmet need within the biomedical research community to develop reliable analytic approaches that can quantify signaling network activities in individual biological samples by integrating multi-omics measurements. We recently conceived a systems biology computational framework, InFlo, which integrates molecular profiling data to decode the functional states of cellular/molecular processes underpinning complex human diseases. Barrett's esophagus is one such complex disease gaining increasing importance to public health, as it is the known precursor to the deadly cancer, esophageal adenocarcinoma. Given that the mechanisms underlying the etiology and pathogenesis of Barrett's Esophagus remain elusive, a major objective of this proposal is to employ the InFlo framework combined molecular profiles derived from primary tissue cohorts, in vitro and in vivo model systems to establish the molecular roadmap of BE pathogenesis and disease recurrence, thus elucidating unifying mechanisms underlying this disease. This systems biology approach would enable the development of evidence-based, diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers for Barrett's esophagus and inform preventive strategies within at-risk populations. Project Narrative This proposal details a novel systems biology approach to enable seamless integration of patient molecular data to decipher the mechanisms underlying complex human diseases. Using this novel integrative analytics approach, we propose to resolve the molecular basis for the development and recurrence of Barrett's Esophagus, a disease with significant public health importance, since it is a known precursor to a lethal esophageal cancer and the mechanisms underpinning this disease remain largely unknown. The findings from our proposed research will enable the development of new diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers and will also inform preventive strategies in high-risk patient populations.",Systems biology frameworks to unravel mechanisms driving complex disorders,9744013,K25DK115904,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Algorithms ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Award ', ' Barrett Esophagus ', ' Columnar-Lined Esophagus ', ' Columnar Epithelial-Lined Lower Esophagus ', ' Barrett Ulcer ', ' Barrett Syndrome ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' cell culture ', ' Cell Culture Techniques ', ' Communities ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Epithelium Part ', ' Epithelium ', ' Esophagitis ', ' Exhibits ', ' Followup Studies ', ' Follow-Up Studies ', ' gastrointestinal disorder ', ' Gastrointestinal Diseases and Manifestations ', ' Gastrointestinal Diseases ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Goals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' In Vitro ', ' Intelligence ', ' Preinterleukin 1 Beta ', ' Interleukin-1β ', ' Interleukin 1beta ', ' IL1β ', ' IL1F2 ', ' IL1B Protein ', ' IL1-β ', ' IL1-Beta ', ' IL-1β ', ' IL-1-b ', ' IL-1 β ', ' IL-1 beta ', ' Beta Proprotein Interleukin 1 ', ' Interleukin-1 beta ', ' Maps ', ' Mentors ', ' Transgenic Mice ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Biological Models ', ' Mucosal Tissue ', ' Mucosa ', ' Mucous Membrane ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Proteins ', ' Public Health ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Specificity ', ' Progenitor Cells ', ' Stem cells ', ' gastric ', ' Stomach ', ' Systems Analyses ', ' Systems Analysis ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Training Programs ', ' Universities ', ' Competence ', ' Molecular Genetics ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' career ', ' genetic manipulation ', ' Clinical ', ' Malignant -

"Identifying phenomic patterns of dental anomalies in orofacial clefting Project Summary/Abstract Background and Candidate: Children with orofacial clefting present with increased rate of dental anomalies in shape, size, number, symmetry, abnormal eruption and malposition of teeth both inside and outside the cleft area, leading to dental problems and reduction of quality of life. Although the scientific community has recognized these findings for a long time, the specific etiological factors underlying such anomalies still remain elusive. An important step to understanding etiology is via careful phenotypic approaches that can detect the co-occurrence of such anomalies in discernable patterns that can simplify the identification of risk factors. Dr. Brian Howe is a Clinical Assistant Professor at the College of Dentistry of the University of Iowa. His primary research focus is on the identification and characterization of oral phenotypes in an effort to identify etiological factors underlying the oral phenotypic spectrum of nonsyndromic orofacial clefting. Career Goals: Dr. Howe's short term goals are to deepen is knowledge of complex craniofacial phenotypes and expand his current understanding of craniofacial development. His long term goals are to become a funded independent researcher and a leading clinician and educator in the field of craniofacial phenomics and dentistry as a tenure track faculty at a University of Iowa. His research plan is innovative in that it leverages unique bioinformatics algorithms to identify complex oral phenotypic patterns amenable for studies of risk factors and causality. Environment: The University of Iowa has an established reputation for the successful training of graduate and postdoctoral students in research and clinical areas. It offers learning and development seminars focused on career development and advancement with particular benefits from training opportunities from its Institute for Clinical and Translational Sciences (ICTS). Career Development Plan: Dr. Howe is committed to attend courses, tutorials, seminars and relevant conferences as well as meeting regularly with his mentors, collaborators, and advisory committee to fulfill is training aims and gain the knowledge necessary to achieve his future research goals and become an independent clinical researcher. Research Study: This research aims to identify oral phenotypic patterns in orofacial clefting using modern and traditional pattern mining methods in a diverse international population with existing environmental and genetic variables. This knowledge will have key implications in our understanding of the etiology of orofacial clefting as well as driving the implementation of innovative treatment approaches to improve dental outcomes and future preventive strategies. Project Narrative  Individuals with nonsyndromic orofacial clefting present with a wide range of dental anomalies leading to more intricate oral rehabilitation procedures which increases dental morbidity and reduces quality of life in those affected. In the largest international cohort of families with orofacial clefting and controls to date, this project will utilize pattern mining approaches to detect the co-occurrence of particular dental anomalies in discernable patterns that will likely simplify the search for the etiological factors underlying these anomalies. This research will aid in our understanding of the etiology of orofacial clefting by expanding and further defining oral phenotypes which will drive biologically meaningful strategies for the identification of genetic risk factors as well as helping to improve clinical care.",Identifying phenomic patterns of dental anomalies in orofacial clefting,9743788,K08DE028012,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Awareness ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' career transition ', ' career advancement ', ' Career Mobility ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communities ', ' Crowns ', ' Dental crowns ', ' tooth enamel ', ' Enamel ', ' Dental Enamel ', ' Dentistry ', ' Environment ', ' Faculty ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Institutes ', ' Iowa ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' maxillary ', ' Maxilla ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Mining ', ' Modernization ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' dental development ', ' Odontogenesis ', ' Phenotype ', ' Pierre Robin sequence ', ' Pierre Robin Syndrome ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' rehabilitative therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Students ', ' Island Flaps ', ' Flaps ', ' Surgical Flaps ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' teeth ', ' Tooth ', ' Tooth structure ', ' Tooth Bud ', ' Tooth Germ ', ' Universities ', ' Deciduous Dentition ', ' Primary Dentition ', ' Gender ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' Mesenchyme ', ' Mesenchymas ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' calcification ', ' Calcified ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' repaired ', ' repair ', ' Biological ', ' Training ', ' Oral cavity ', ' Mouth ', ' Cavitas Oris ', ' Buccal Cavity Head and Neck ', ' Buccal Cavity ', ' Dental ', ' Individual ', ' Development Plans ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Genetic ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' permanent tooth ', ' Secondary Dentition ', ' Permanent Dentition ', ' Adult Dentition ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Side ', ' Oral ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Pattern ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' meetings ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' craniofacial ', ' craniofacies ', ' professor ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' research study ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' genetic risk factor ', ' inherited factor ', ' career development ', ' Vascular blood supply ', ' vascular supply ', ' blood supply ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Preventive ', ' Age-Months ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' High Prevalence ', ' International ', ' Mesenchymal ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Translational Research ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' trend ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' palatogenesis ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' analytical tool ', ' craniofacial complex ', ' high risk ', ' clinical care ', ' phenomics ', ' risk variant ', ' risk locus ', ' risk loci ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk gene ', ' risk allele ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' craniofacial development ', ' orofacial cleft ', ' orofacial clefting ', ' tenure track ', ' tenure process ', ' training opportunity ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,K08,2019,12553,IA-02,0.0065986589890655555
"HERCULES: Exposome Research Center PROJECT SUMMARY: HERCULES The vision of the HERCULES P30 is to demonstrably advance the role of environmental health sciences in clinical and public health settings using the platform of the exposome. Healthcare and biomedical research have become increasingly genome-centric. While much of this is due to the impressive achievements in genomics, which have consistently outpaced gains in environmental health, it is our contention that a more persuasive case needs to be made for environmental factors. Science and intuition support the idea that the environment plays just as large of a role as genetics for the majority of diseases. The exposome, which embraces a strategy and scale similar to genomic research, is poised to elevate the environment in discussions of health and disease. We will continue to grow and enhance the environmental health science research portfolio at Emory through cutting-edge technologies and innovative data solutions. We will build upon the superb relationships we have built with the local community and continue to push the mission of NIEHS on campus and across the scientific landscape. Based on the extraordinary progress over our first three years, we propose to retain our theme to use exposome-related concepts and approaches to improve human health. This simple and unifying vision will continue to stimulate discovery, promote collaboration, and enhance communication through the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. To marshal physical and intellectual resources to support exposome-related approaches (high-resolution metabolomics, analytical chemistry, systems biology, machine learning, bioinformatics, high-throughput toxicology, and spatial and temporal statistical models) through cores, pilot funding, mentoring, and research forums. Specific Aim 2. To make major contributions towards exposome and environmental health science research. Specific Aim 3. To provide career development activities around innovative and emerging concepts and approaches related to the exposome. Specific Aim 4. To enhance and expand existing relationships with community partners to resolve environmental health issues in the community using exposome principles. Specific Aim 5. To provide infrastructure and resources to facilitate rapid translation of novel scientific findings into the development of prevention and treatment strategies in humans. Pursuit of HERCULES' aims will advance environmental health sciences within our institutions and in the scientific community.

"The Effects of Insurance Benefit Design Innovation on Patient Health Abstract My research in health economics has focused on how information and targeted consumer cost-sharing influences how patients choose providers and the financial savings of incentivizing patients to choose low-price providers. I have also examined the opposite side of the market, how patient use of information and targeted consumer incentives spurs provider price competition. These topics provided the framework for my research as a PhD student in Health Economics at the University of California, Berkeley and I continue to build on these topics while a policy researcher at the RAND Corporation. A natural next step for my career is to expand this line of research but in a more in-depth manner and using more advanced statistical methods. Performing mentored research in these areas will help me successfully make the transition from directed to independent research. The proposed study will help me to (1) contribute to a deeper understanding of patient health effects of an innovative insurance benefit design that is particularly relevant for the aging population; (2) continue to build capabilities working with large medical claims data sets and develop expertise in innovative statistical methods from different disciplines; (3) gain training in aging-related health-services research; (4) expand my exposure to the aging, health economics, and health services research communities; and (5) develop my abilities as an independent health services researcher and build the foundations to successfully compete for R01-level grants.  In this project, I propose to examine whether reference pricing for colonoscopies and pharmaceuticals decreases adherence to recommended colorectal cancer screening and medication therapies among the near- elderly population. I will also examine the impact of reference pricing on patient health outcomes and the aging process. To do so, I intend to apply novel machine-learning statistical methods that have been recently developed in the computer science and statistics fields. As part of this proposal, I have built a formal training plan to develop expertise in these methods. This project will provide me with the flexibility and support to develop a long-term research agenda that focuses on using innovative statistical methods to evaluate the comprehensive effects of consumer cost- sharing programs. Although this study focuses on a single cost- sharing program, reference pricing, the skills I gain through this award will allow me to independently lead evaluations of future benefit designs. The application of machine-learning methods to the setting of reference pricing will provide a framework that I or other researchers can use to evaluate other insurance benefit designs or alternative patient populations. ! Narrative An increasingly popular insurance benefit design, reference pricing, provides targeted financial incentives for consumers to receive care at low-cost providers. While the financial savings from reference pricing programs are well-known, the health impacts have yet to be studied. The proposed career grant will apply machine learning techniques to develop a long-term research agenda focused on understanding the patient health effects of reference pricing for colonoscopies and medication therapies, which are services that are especially relevant for the aging population. !",The Effects of Insurance Benefit Design Innovation on Patient Health,9646811,K01AG061274,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' California ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Colonoscopy ', ' Communities ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Deductibles ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health Services ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Services Research ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incentives ', ' Inpatients ', ' Insurance ', ' Insurance Benefits ', ' Insurers ', ' Insurance Carriers ', ' Internal Medicine ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' Northeastern United States ', ' New England ', ' Patients ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Publishing ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Retirement ', ' Savings ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' pricing ', ' Price ', ' Cost Sharing ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Benefit ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' Journals ', ' Magazine ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' detect colorectal cancer ', ' detect colo-rectal cancer ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' colorectal cancer detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer screening ', ' colo-rectal cancer early detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' Exposure to ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Side ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Services ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' computer science ', ' Employee ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' response ', ' Provider ', ' Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' treatment compliance ', ' therapy cooperation ', ' therapy compliance ', ' patient cooperation ', ' patient adherence ', ' Patient Compliance ', ' compliance behavior ', ' Adherence ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cost ', ' health economics ', ' asthmatic patient ', ' asthma patient ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' treatment effect ', ' aging population ', ' population aging ', ' aged population ', ' patient population ', ' financial incentive ', ' monetary incentive ', ' financial reward ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' doctoral student ', ' PhD. student ', ' PhD student ', ' Ph.D. student ', ' Ph.D student ', ' Ph.

"Transformative Computational Infrastructures for Cell-Based Biomarker Diagnostics Project Summary The presence of abnormal cell populations in patient samples is diagnostic for a variety of human diseases, especially leukemias and lymphomas. One of the main technologies used for cell-based diagnostic evaluation is flow cytometry, which employs fluorescent reagents to measure molecular characteristics of cell populations in complex mixtures. While cytometry evaluation is routinely used for the diagnosis of blood-borne malignancies, it could be more widely applied to the diagnosis of other diseases (e.g. asthma, allergy and autoimmunity) if it could be reproducibly used to interpret higher complexity staining panels and recognize more subtle cell population differences. Flow cytometry analysis is also widely used for single cell phenotyping in translational research studies to explore the mechanisms of normal and abnormal biological processes. More recently, the development of mass cytometry promises to further increase the application of single cell cytometry evaluation to understand a wide range of physiological, pathological and therapeutic processes. The current practice for cytometry data analysis relies on “manual gating” of two-dimensional data plots to identify cell subsets in complex mixtures. However, this process is subjective, labor intensive, and irreproducible making it difficult to deploy in multicenter translational research studies or clinical trials where protocol standardization and harmonization are essential. The goal of this project is to develop, validate and disseminate a user-friendly infrastructure for the computational analysis of cytometry data for both diagnostic and discovery applications that could help overcome the current limitations of manual analysis and provide for more efficient, objective and accurate analysis, through the following aims: Specific Aim 1 – Implement a novel computational infrastructure – FlowGate – for cytometry data analysis that includes visual analytics and machine learning; Specific Aim 2 – Assess the utility of FlowGate for cell population characterization in mechanistic translational research studies (T1); Specific Aim 3 – Assess the robustness and accuracy of FlowGate for clinical diagnostics in comparison with the current standard-of-care analysis of diagnostic cytometry data (T2); Specific Aim 4 – Develop training and educational resources and conduct directed outreach activities to stimulate adoption and use of the resulting FlowGate cyberinfrastructure. The project will have a major impact in advancing translational science by overcoming key hurdles for adoption of these computational methods by facilitating analysis pipeline optimization, providing intuitive user interfacing, and delivering directed training activities. The application of the developed computational infrastructure for improved diagnostics of AML and CLL will contribute to the new emphasis on precision medicine by more precisely quantifying the patient-specific characteristics of neoplastic and normal reactive cell populations. Although FlowGate will be developed by the UC San Diego, UC Irvine, and Stanford CTSAs, the resulting computational infrastructure will be made freely available to the entire research community. Project Narrative Flow cytometry analysis is widely used for single cell phenotyping in the translational research lab to explore the mechanisms of normal and abnormal biological processes and in the clinical diagnostic lab for the identification and classification of blood-borne malignancies. However, the current practice for cytometry data analysis using “manual gating” based on two-dimensional data plots is subjective, labor-intensive and unreliable, especially when using more complex high content staining panels.

"Measuring, Modeling and Controlling Heterogeneity ABSTRACT - Overall The overall goal of the Measuring, Modeling and Controlling Heterogeneity Center in the Cancer Systems Biol- ogy Consortium (M2CH-CSBC Center) is to improve management of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) by developing systems level strategies to prevent the emergence of cancer subpopulations that are resistant to treatment. We postulate that heterogeneity arising from epigenomic instability intrinsic to cancer cells and di- verse signals from extrinsic microenvironments in which cancer cells reside are root causes of resistance. We will learn how intrinsic and extrinsic factors influence differentiation state, proliferation and therapeutic re- sponse in TNBC through experimental manipulation and computational modeling of cancer cell lines, 3D engi- neered multicellular systems, xenografts and clinical specimens. We will deploy single cell `omic and imaging technologies that allow quantitative assessment of molecular, cellular, and structural heterogeneity. We will interpret these data using computational models that define control networks and structures in heterogeneous systems as well as transitions between states of therapeutic resistance and sensitivity. This will be accom- plished in three related Projects and three Cores. Project 1 will focus on measuring and managing resistance- associated heterogeneity intrinsic to cancer cells. Project 2 will focus on identifying resistance-associated sig- nals from the microenvironment and on mitigating effects from these signals on therapeutic response. Project 3 will apply spatial systems biology approaches to TNBC specimens and multicell type models thereof to dis- cover molecular control networks that influence how cell intrinsic plasticity and microenvironment signaling al- ter therapeutic responses in complex tissues. All three Projects will include analysis of 5 core cell lines (HCC1143, HCC1599, MDA-MB-468, SUM149PT, and HCC1806), 5 patient derived cultures, and 6 FDA ap- proved, pathway-targeted drugs (afatinib, ruxolotinib, trametinib, BYL719, cabozantinib, and everolimus). The computational network discovery, data integration, spatial systems analysis and modeling approaches are the same in all Projects and serve to integrate the work of the overall M2CH-CSBC Center. Multiple integrative computational strategies are proposed to identify candidate heterogeneity control networks. These include analysis of existing genomic, epigenomic, pharmacologic response, and metabolomic characteristics of prima- ry tumors and models thereof. An Imaging Management and Analysis Core will provide infrastructure and image analytics that will enable efficient image data management, quantitative analysis of image features, and visualization of images and metadata generated using multiscale light and electron microscopy. An Outreach Core will make educational materials, experimental and computational tools and data available to the CSB Consortium, to the CSBC/PS-ON Coordinating Center and to the broader scientific community. An Administrative Core serves as the organization, integration, and evaluation hub of the M2CH-CSBC Center. Project narrative This Project will improve management of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) by understanding and managing heterogeneity arising from epigenomic instability intrinsic to cancer cells and from diverse signals from extrinsic microenvironments in which cancer cells reside.","Measuring, Modeling and Controlling Heterogeneity",9691279,U54CA209988,"['Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Communities ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' In Vitro ', ' Leadership ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Electron Microscopy ', ' Patients ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Periodicity ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Phenotype ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Proteins ', ' Reagent ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Stress ', ' Systems Analyses ', ' Systems Analysis ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Work ', ' Immunofluorescence ', ' Immunofluorescence Immunologic ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Custom ', ' Imagery ', ' Visualization ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Image Analysis ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Measurement ', ' Plant Roots ', ' root ', ' Cellular Structures ', ' Cell Structure ', ' Cell Components ', ' Therapeutic ', ' cancer cell ', ' Malignant Cell ', ' Specimen ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' light microscopy ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' 3D ', ' 3-D ', ' Xenograft procedure ', ' xeno-transplantation ', ' xeno-transplant ', ' Xenotransplantation ', ' Xenograft ', ' Heterologous Transplantation ', ' Heterograft ', ' SDZ RAD ', ' everolimus ', ' data management ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' outreach ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' bioimaging ', ' biomedical imaging ', ' bio-imaging ', ' Genomics ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabolomics ', ' Microarray Analysis ', ' microarray technology ', ' microarray analyses ', ' Microarray-Based Analysis ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Data ', ' Educational Materials ', ' Breast Cancer Cell ', ' breast tumor cell ', ' in vivo ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Clonal Expansion ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Metadata ', ' meta data ', ' triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma ', ' triple-negative breast cancer ', ' TNBC ', ' therapy resistant ', ' treatment resistance ', ' therapeutic resistance ', ' resistant to therapy ', ' resistance to therapy ', ' epigenomics ', ' image visualization ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' data integration ', ' Cancer cell line ', ' Imaging technology ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' analytical tool ', ' combinatorial ', ' Cell model ', ' Cellular model ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' open source ', ' network models ', ' tumor ', ' FDA approved ', ' treatment response ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted therapy ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' quantitative imaging ', ' MDA-MB-468 ', ' bioprinting ', ' bio-printing ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Infrastructure ', ' computational suite ', ' ']",NCI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,U54,2019,2164435,OR-03,-0.06564321278827515
"Overall NIDA Core ""Center of Excellence"" in Transcriptomics, Systems Genetics and the Addictome Addiction is a highly complex disease with risk factors that include genetic variants and differences in development, sex, and environment. The long term potential of precision medicine to improve drug treatment and prevention depends on gaining a much better understanding how genetics, drugs, brain cells, and neuronal circuitry interact to influence behavior. There are serious technical barriers that prevent researchers and clinicians from incorporating more powerful computational and predictive methods in addiction research. The purpose of the NIDA P30 Core Center of Excellence in Omics, Systems Genetics, and the Addictome is to empower and train researchers supported by NIH, NIDA, NIAAA, and other federal and state institutions to use more quantitative and testable ways to analyze genetic, epigenetic, and the environmental factors that influence drug abuse risk and treatment. In the Transcriptome Informatics and Mechanisms research core we assemble and upgrade hundreds of large genome (DNA) and transcriptome (RNA) datasets for experimental rodent (rat) models of addiction. In the Systems Analytics and Modeling research core, we are using innovative systems genetics methods (gene mapping) to understand the linkage between DNA differences, environmental risks such as stress, and the differential risk of drug abuse and relapse. Our Pilot core is catalyzing new collaborations among young investigator in the field of addiction research. In sum the Center is a national resource for more reproducible research in addiction. We are centralizing, archiving, distributing, analyzing and integrating high quality data, metadata, using open software systems in collaboration with many other teams of researchers. Our goal is to help build toward an NIDA Addictome Portal that will include all genomic research relevant to addiction research. PROJECT NARRATIVE The NIDA Core Center of Excellence in Omics, Systems Genetics, and the Addictome (OSGA) provides genomic and computational support to a large number of research scientists working on mechanisms and treatment of addiction. The two main research cores of OSGA are providing support for transcriptome, epigenome, and metagenome studies of rat models of addiction at many levels of analysis. We are also creating open access tools and a powerful web portal to catalyze more effective and replicable use of massive datasets generated by programs in addiction biology and treatment.","Overall

"Studying pseudogout using naturallanguage processing and novelimaging approaches Candidate: Dr. Tedeschi is an Instructor in Medicine at Harvard Medical School (HMS) and Associate Physician in the Division of Rheumatology, Immunology and Allergy’s Section of Clinical Sciences (SCS) at Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH). She received an MPH from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health (HSPH). Her 10 first-author manuscripts, two BWH grants, and foundation award exemplify her productivity and commitment to research. She has assembled an experienced team of mentors and collaborators, led by Dr. Daniel Solomon (primary mentor) and Drs. Katherine Liao and Karen Costenbader (co-mentors), to guide her training in natural language processing and machine learning approaches for clinical research, analysis of linked electronic medical record (EMR) and Medicare claims data, and interpretation of advanced imaging modalities. Focused coursework at HSPH and HMS will complement the experience she gains through her proposed studies of pseudogout risk factors and long-term outcomes. Training in dual- energy CT and ultrasound interpretation for crystalline arthritis will be obtained via one-on-one sessions. Her long-term career goal is to become an independent patient-oriented investigator focused on pseudogout. Environment: Dr. Tedeschi has a commitment from her Division for >75% protected time for research and career development activities during the K23 award period. Support from the Division and her primary mentor’s research funds will supplement her salary and project-related expenses. The SCS, a collaborative clinical research group in the Division of Rheumatology, has extensive infrastructure including the VERITY Bioinformatics Core (NIH-P30-AR072577, PI: Solomon) that will provide resources and expertise for the proposed studies. In addition, the BWH Arthritis Center is one of the largest nationally, facilitating subject recruitment, and the BWH Division of Musculoskeletal Imaging has state-of-the-art equipment and expertise applying dual-energy CT in crystalline arthritis. Coursework at HSPH and HMS, adjacent to BWH, will provide training necessary for Dr. Tedeschi’s development into an independent investigator. Research: Dr. Tedeschi’s long-term objective is to prevent and reduce morbidity from pseudogout, an understudied, painful crystalline arthritis that affects 8-10 million Americans. She will use natural language processing and machine learning approaches to enhance an algorithm for identifying pseudogout in EMR data. She will study risk factors for and long-term outcomes in pseudogout, harnessing vast amounts of information contained in Partners HealthCare EMR data and Medicare claims data, and will gain experience working with linked datasets. Dr. Tedeschi will recruit subjects with pseudogout and other types of mono- and oligoarthritis to test and compare the performance of dual-energy CT scanning, musculoskeletal ultrasound, and x-ray for identifying pseudogout. Her proposed K23 projects will lead to manuscripts and data to be leveraged in an R01 application focused on pseudogout during the award period, leading to independence as a patient-oriented investigator. Project Narrative The proposed studies will contribute fundamental knowledge about pseudogout, a common, painful crystalline arthritis for which we have little prognostic information and no targeted treatments. Results from the proposed projects could lead to methods for non-invasive, accurate pseudogout diagnosis, development of preventive strategies for pseudogout, and interventions to reduce cardiovascular disease risk. Future work stemming from the proposed projects may include predictive models of pseudogout flares, identification of serum biomarkers for pseudogout, and development of outcomes measures to be used in prospectively recruited pseudogout cohort studies.",Studying pseudogout using naturallanguage processing and novelimaging approaches,9717330,K23AR075070,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms

"Health, Neighborhood Context, and Mobility Neighborhood context may be an upstream cause of economic mobility, yet few neighborhood studies are experimental, weakening causal inference and limiting policy translation. Our study proposes to analyze newly- available data from a large, federal government initiated social experiment of voluntary neighborhood relocation using housing vouchers in 5 US cities (the Moving to Opportunity, MTO, Study). Our project will test whether, how, and among whom random assignment of an offer to move to a lower-poverty neighborhood influenced the economic mobility of 4600 low-income families over a 15 year period. The goal of MTO was to interrupt the cascading effects of neighborhood poverty for minority low-income families, by increasing area- based access to opportunities, and thereby promote economic mobility. Although the MTO voucher intervention did not consistently affect economic outcomes, it did profoundly affect health. Unfortunately, health researchers have had limited access to MTO data, compromising the scientific payoff of the $70+ million investment. So as of yet, we have no clear understanding of why results might differ across outcomes, groups, or what mechanisms are at play, since few studies have tested mediation or moderation. Since health is one of the most important barriers to economic self-sufficiency among low-income parents, it is conceivable that economic and employment gains were concentrated among families who first experienced health improvements. However testing whether factors that occurred after random assignment are precursors for other outcomes is methodologically challenging. Fortunately, recent methodological developments in the epidemiology discipline offer cogent solutions to model this complexity and bound any bias. We propose secondary data analyses with newly available 15 year follow-up data from this experiment, to test whether health influenced the economic effects of the randomized MTO housing voucher treatment. Paired with this experimental design, we propose to apply innovative causal methods and machine learning techniques for assessing mediation and effect modification, to overcome limitations and potential bias of traditional approaches, and strengthen causal inference. Our R01 project builds on a productive, interdisciplinary team, experienced with the MTO data, and draws on a barriers-to-employment framework. We propose 4 aims to determine: whether the effect of MTO on economic outcomes was modified by baseline health vulnerability; whether MTO improved parental economic outcomes, if they or their children experienced health gains; whether MTO improved children’s employment and education, if they experienced health gains; whether MTO improved economic outcomes, if families moved to neighborhoods with fewer spatial barriers to employment. Our findings have direct policy relevance since they address a key policy question in housing voucher implementation: incorporating elements from non-housing sectors (e.g., health, employment, education) to promote moves to higher opportunity neighborhoods, to ultimately improve outcomes for low income families. This project will test whether health-related barriers to employment mediate and moderate the effects of a social experiment of housing and neighborhood relocation on economic mobility, among adolescents, young adults, and their mothers. This knowledge will inform the next generation of social policy, e.g., to provide guidance on augmenting housing counseling assistance services to include health-related additional program supports and cross-sectoral services (e.g. health management or substance use treatment services) for vulnerable families.","Health, Neighborhood Context, and Mobility",9712679,R01HD090014,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Budgets ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Child Development ', ' Cities ', ' Counseling ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Economics ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Elements ', ' Employment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Family ', ' National Government ', ' Federal Government ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Housing ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' indexing ', ' Investments ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mothers ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Parents ', ' Play ', ' Poverty ', ' Privatization ', ' Public Housing ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Salaries ', ' Wages ', ' Social Policies ', ' Testing ', ' Translations ', ' Weight ', ' Measures ', ' Data Compromising ', ' Mediating ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Discipline ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' interdisciplinary collaboration ', ' transdisciplinary collaboration ', ' cohort ', ' Family health status ', ' Family Health ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' voucher ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Low income ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Interruption ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Modification ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' treatment effect ', ' volunteer ', ' economic outcome ', ' treatment group ', ' improved outcome ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' lower income families ', ' welfare ', ' treatment services ', ' health management ', ' healthcare management ', ' health care management ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2019,483010,MN-05,-0.016401010235932014
"Predictive engineering of cellular transcriptional state PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Specific combinations of transcription factors (TFs) exhibit emergent properties when functioning together, enabling the generation of diverse cell types and behaviors. However, identifying which combinations regulate a behavior of interest requires overcoming a combinatorial explosion, as among the ~1,600 TFs in the human genome there are ~1.3 million possible pairs alone. This scaling challenge has forced past efforts at systematically mapping such genetic interactions (GIs) to rely on simple, parallelizable measures of phenotype such as growth rate. Each GI is then characterized only by a single number, obscuring the mechanistic or molecular basis for any particular interaction: put simply, there are many ways for cells to appear equally “unfit.” Finally, many human cell types are quiescent or post-mitotic, so that the growth-based measures of interaction that have been highly successful in model organisms such as yeast do not apply. Here we address these challenges by introducing a new, massively parallel method for studying GIs in human cells that combines rich phenotyping of single cells with an analytical framework for predicting which combinations are most informative to measure. We leverage the recently developed Perturb-seq screening technology, which allows pooled profiling of CRISPR-mediated genetic perturbations with single-cell RNA sequencing as the phenotypic readout. This approach allows us to overexpress many programmed combinations of TFs using CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) and obtain a direct readout of their transcriptional consequences. The resulting rich phenotypes yield insight into the biological origins of GIs, and can for example identify combinations of TFs that promote differentiation to diverse cell states. They also provide a critical “handle” to apply modern machine learning methods. Using techniques from the field of compressed sensing, we propose a predictive approach for searching combinatorial spaces of GIs that would be too large to profile exhaustively by any experimental technology. Since the transcriptome is a direct readout of TF function and TFs interact via specific mechanisms such as cooperative binding at target promoters, these large-scale experiments can also be used to study deeper questions on how GIs emerge mechanistically, and how neomorphic (i.e. entirely new or unpredictable) phenotypes are generated. Our research provides the first scalable method for simultaneously finding and characterizing GIs in any system, a technique for rapidly mapping the “levers” controlling cell fate in diverse models of development and disease, and a model for how machine learning can be used to design the large combinatorial genetics experiments made possible by Cas9. PROJECT NARRATIVE Understanding how genes work together to realize different cellular phenotypes is one of the core problems of genetics. This proposal develops a new experimental and computational approach for mapping the different states that cells can occupy, and for identifying combinations of genes that push cells into these states.

"Organizational and Cultural Dynamics in Genomics Companies: Industry Engagement in Navigating Social and Ethical Issues This K99/R00 Award is designed to generate scholarship and interventions to guide genomics companies towards more just practices. It does so through a five-year training and research project, which investigates perspectives from members of the genomics industry, and leverages them to inform normative analyses and identify feasible paths towards concrete change. The project addresses issues of price, access and industrial control, with a focus on the ethics of profit and social responsibility. Through the proposed training program, the project prepares the candidate as an independent scholar whose research program links empirical and normative research with practical interventions to positively influence ethics and justice in private sector genomics. The first phase of research (conducted during the K phase, alongside training activities) is a comparative study examining social and cultural factors involved in perceptions of ethical issues among members of industry. The comparative study focuses on three biotech hubs in the US (the Bay Area, San Diego, and Boston), as well as an additional site in South Africa (Cape Town). The South African site helps place investigation of the US industry in light of a shifting global industry, and especially South Africa’s policy focus on genomics for population health (as well as its role in the H3Africa initiative). The study also considers industry subsector and individual company culture, in examining influences on industry approaches to social and ethical issues. During its R phase, the project then involves a systematic normative analysis of profit and social obligation in the genomics industry, based on key theories from bioethics and business ethics. The project will then feed this scholarly analysis back to industry stakeholders; using a Delphi study, it allows members of industry to use results of the normative analysis in strategizing interventions with the greatest likelihood of influencing the genomics industry in ethically desirable ways. This project addresses the NHGRI ELSI research priorities of genomic equity and social justice, as well as genomics and public health. Its career development plan focuses on training in normative analysis and Delphi methods, as well as content training in genomics and entrepreneurship. The training will be conducted at Johns Hopkins University, where the school’s preeminent bioethics center houses world experts in qualitative and quantitative empirical bioethics, alongside the University’s leading research and training in the biomedical sciences and their application in industry. The integrated research and training plan will prepare the candidate as an independent ELSI scholar with a rigorous research program focused on empirical and normative analysis of the business of biomedicine and genomics, and engagement with industry stakeholders. This Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00) investigates and leverages perspectives from members of the health-related private sector genomics industry, to develop guidance for improving approaches to social and ethical issues in the industry. It does so through in-depth qualitative analysis (interviews, cases studies, comparative analysis), scholarly normative analysis (drawing on theories from bioethics and business ethics), and a Delphi process of iterative questionnaires with industry stakeholders, aimed at strategizing concrete change regarding social obligations of the industry.

"Mechanobiology of aortic smooth muscle cells in human iPSC-based models of Marfan Syndrome PROJECT SUMMARY Marfan Syndrome (MFS), one of the most common heritable connective tissue disorders, affects 1 in 5,000 individuals and has destructive manifestations in multiple organ systems; notably the cardiovascular system. MFS is an autosomal dominant disease caused by a genetic mutation in the Fibrillin-1 gene leading to aberrant TGFβ signaling, and frequently results in aortic aneurysm, dissection, and death. Interestingly, the associated degeneration within the aortic vessel wall almost always occurs in the aortic root or ascending aorta and not in the descending or abdominal aorta; while this putatively reflects regional differences in hemodynamic stress, antihypertensive treatment alone is not effective in managing aortic aneurysm in MFS. Alternatively, it is also the case that aortic smooth muscle cells (ASMCs), which predominate the vasoactive medial layer of the vessel wall, have heterogeneous subtypes stemming from distinct developmental germ-layers based on their anatomical location; Neuroectoderm (NE) origin gives rise to ascending ASMCs and Paraxial mesoderm (PM) origin gives rise to descending ASMCs. This project will use origin-specific ASMCs differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from patients with MFS and healthy controls to test a novel hypothesis that developmental origin causes location-specific abnormalities in ASMCs associated with medial degeneration in MFS. Additionally, it will explore for biomarkers of presymptomatic congenital defects in Marfan Syndrome to identify novel targets for prophylactic therapeutic intervention. These studies will characterize phenotypic differences in human ASMC subtypes at the cellular and tissue level with stem-cell culturing and vascular tissue engineering techniques. Using state-of-the-art core facilities we will also conduct transcriptomic and proteomic analysis on these cellular and tissue models to cultivate a rich biological profile for bioinformatic analysis. Furthermore, we will develop a bioinformatics pipeline to elucidate novel prophylactic targets inherently responsible for ascending aortic MFS-induced medial degeneration, using our uniquely combined phenotypic, transcriptomic, and proteomic results as input. Lastly, based on our bioinformatic outputs we will test our intervention on our human iPSC-based in vitro models and compare to treatment with Losartan, a commonly used anti-hypertensive drug that also exhibits unique anti-remodeling properties and has shown promise for managing the symptoms of MFS in animals and in patients. The training plan for this fellowship will focus on technical skills, experimental design and critical analysis, critique of published scientific data, and presentation skills. It will be achieved by regular mentor meetings, journal clubs, conference presentations, bi- annual committee meetings, and advanced coursework. The majority of training will occur in the Costa Lab at the Cardiovascular Research Center at ISMMS, a highly active and collaborative environment with available mentors and students aligned with my research topics and career goals. Additional training will occur in the Ramirez Lab with senior researchers in Marfan Syndrome and biochemical investigation techniques. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research proposes a bioengineering approach for investigating new human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-based cellular and 3D tissue models of Marfan Syndrome (MFS), a rare connective tissue disorder that frequently causes aortic aneurysm and dissection specifically in the ascending aorta. Our findings will elucidate mechanobiological differences in aortic smooth muscle cells of distinct embryologic origin, and their underlying mechanisms of response to mechanical stimuli. This will help improve our understanding of aneurysm localization in MFS, and guide more effective therapies for MFS patients in the future.",Mechanobiology of aortic smooth muscle cells in human

"Niche signals in HSC genesis PROJECT SUMMARY Hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) have well established clinical applications in the treatment of heritable and acquired blood disorders. However, their therapeutic potential could be significantly broadened by engineering novel methods to generate HSC de novo from pluripotent stem cells or from directly reprogrammed adult cells. Toward this goal, we have established endothelial cell (EC) niche based culture methods that provide the necessary conditions to support the specification and self-renewal of HSC from embryonic hemogenic precursors, and more recently, from adult ECs using transcription factor (TF)-mediated conversion that bypasses a pluripotent intermediate. We hypothesize that recreating the signals necessary and sufficient to develop a clinically meaningful system for HSC generation in vitro will necessitate a comprehensive, systems approach to deconstruct the niche provided signals required for HSC specification and self-renewal. Thus, the overall goal of this grant is to leverage unique expertise of the collaborating laboratories to elucidate the signaling interactions regulating HSC specification and self-renewal from embryonic hemogenic precursors or TF-reprogrammed adult EC in the context of the EC niche. Our approach consists of three overlapping aims. The first aim will identify EC niche-provided signals necessary for embryonic HSC specification and self-renewal. The second aim will identify the unique HSC programs induced by these signals that regulate the transition from embryonic hemogenic precursor to bone fide repopulating HSC. The third will identify comparable programs that regulate the transition from adult EC to HSC during TF-mediated reprogramming in the EC niche. Key to these studies will be innovative functional assays, transcriptional profiling methods, and computational approaches that will enable us to resolve cellular complexity of niche cells and their interactions with developing embryonic or reprogrammed HSC at the single cell level. The role of identified signal factors in stage-specific support of HSC specification will be validated and further refined in vitro by gain and loss of function studies in the context of niche EC. Furthermore, to extend these studies to stromal cell-free systems as a step toward clinical translation, we will also test the contribution of identified signal factors in HSC specification and self-renewal in the context of stage-specific modulation of Notch activation using engineered Notch agonists. To achieve the goals of this proposal, we have developed a multidisciplinary collaboration involving unique expertise in each of our laboratories, including basic HSC and EC niche cell biology, direct TF based cellular conversion, clinical HSC transplantation, genome wide assessment of rare stem cell populations at single cell resolution, and innovative computational approaches to deconstruct core signal pathways regulating developmental transitions. Altogether, we expect the proposed studies will ultimately guide the design of novel strategies for deriving and expanding HSC in vitro for therapeutic applications. NARRATIVE Hematopoietic stem cells are currently used in the treatment and cure of a variety of blood disorders. Methods to generate new or greater numbers of hematopoietic stem cells in the laboratory could expand the availability and therapeutic applications of these valuable cells, but currently such methods are lacking. The goal of this proposal is to use lessons from endothelial cells, which provide critical signals to support hematopoietic stem cells, to engineer novel systems for the development and expansion of hematopoietic stem cells in culture. !",Niche signals in HSC genesis,9979872,RC2DK114777,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Aorta ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' blastomere structure ', ' Blastocytes ', ' Embryonic Cell ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' bone ', ' Cell Culture Techniques ', ' cell culture ', ' Cell-Free System ', ' Cellfree System ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Embryo ', ' Embryonic ', ' Embryonic Development ', ' Embryo Development ', ' Embryogenesis ', ' Engineering ', ' Goals ', ' Gonadal structure ', ' gonad ', ' gonads ', ' Grant ', ' Hematological Disease ', ' Blood Diseases ', ' Hematologic Diseases ', ' Hematological Disorder ', ' blood disorder ', ' Hematopoietic stem cells ', ' Blood Precursor Cell ', ' Hematopoietic Progenitor Cells ', ' blood stem cell ', ' hematopoietic progenitor ', ' hematopoietic stem progenitor cell ', ' hemopoietic progenitor ', ' hemopoietic stem cell ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' In Vitro ', ' indexing ', ' Laboratories ', ' Mesonephric structure ', ' Mesonephros ', ' Wolffian Body ', ' Methods ', ' Physiological Processes ', ' Organism-Level Process ', ' Organismal Process ', ' Physiologic Processes ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Testing ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' Generations ', ' notch protein ', ' notch ', ' notch receptors ', ' Mediating ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Stromal Cells ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Endothelial Cells ', ' insight ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' HSC transplantation ', ' Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant ', ' Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation ', ' Agonist ', ' Co-culture ', ' Cocultivation ', ' Coculture ', ' Coculture Techniques ', ' Therapeutic ', ' programs ', ' cell biology ', ' Cellular biology ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' ES cell ', ' stem cell of embryonic origin ', ' embryonic stem cell ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' receptor ', ' novel ', ' sorting ', ' Sorting - Cell Movement ', ' Bypass ', ' Gene Expression Monitoring ', ' Gene Expression Pattern Analysis ', ' Transcript Expression Analyses ', ' Transcript Expression Analysis ', ' gene expression analysis ', ' gene expression assay ', ' transcriptional profiling ', ' Gene Expression Profiling ', ' Pluripotent Stem Cells ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' Address ', ' Molecular Analysis ', ' Resolution ', ' Stem Cell Development ', ' in vivo ', ' Signaling Molecule ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Heritability ', ' clinical applicability ', ' clinical application ', ' loss of function ', ' self-renew ', ' self-renewal ', ' stem ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' genome-wide ', ' stem cell population ', ' Systems Development ', ' clinical translation ', ' scRNA-seq ', ' single cell RNA-seq ', ' single cell RNAseq ', ' single-cell RNA sequencing ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' HSC expansion ', ' blood stem cell expansion ', ' hematopoietic stem cell expansion ', ' HSC regeneration ', ' HSC self-renewal ', ' hematopoietic stem cell regeneration ', ' hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal ', ' HSC Specification ', ' Hematopoietic Stem Cell Specification ', ' ']",NIDDK,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,RC2,2020,640964,WA-07,-0.003953525454029172
"Assessment of murine retinal acuity ex vivo by machine learning of multielectrode array recordings Project Summary: Darwin Babino, PhD, a trained pharmacologist/electrophysiologist, has spent the last ten years working on several disciplines in the vision sciences. His proposal entitled “Assessment of murine retinal acuity ex vivo by machine learning of multielectrode array recordings” presents his overarching goal to improve vision restoration approaches by developing methods to test the potential of these techniques thereby accelerating the development of effective interventions. Dr. Babino and his primary mentor, Dr. Russell Van Gelder, have assembled a strong team of co-mentors at the University of Washington SOM and collaborators to guide him through the proposed training and research. His previous training will be supplemented with goals to help his development as an independent investigator: 1) Study design and practical learning in performing panretinal (MEA) biological experiments; 2) Fundamental and advanced techniques of the proposed optogenetic and stem-cell restoration techniques; 3) Application of advanced machine learning techniques; 4) Develop leadership and professional skills to establish an independent group. The ability to assess the function of panretinal circuitry will foster our understanding of the advantages and weaknesses of different restoration techniques (Aim 1). The work proposed here will improve an existing retinal acuity assessment tool which combines machine learning techniques on novel, high-density multielectrode array recordings of ganglion cell responses in several mouse models. The utility of this system will be demonstrated in assessing visual potential of the mouse retina in three different approaches to vision restoration that are challenging for in vivo assessment (Aim 2). In collaboration with Dr. Deepak A. Lamba at UCSF, we will apply our system to animals which have undergone stem-cell replacement of retinal cells including photoreceptor cells. An optogenetics approach will also be evaluated in collaboration with Dr. John Flannery at UC Berkeley whose group has developed vectors for expressing rhodopsin and cone opsins in ganglion and bipolar cells. Finally, differences between native and restored vison with small molecule photoswitches, light-activated inhibitors of voltage-gated potassium channels, which confer light-dependent firing on treated cells, will be assessed. The resulting advanced electrophysiology application will help elucidate fundamental questions about the functional retina, mechanisms that lead to retinal degeneration and the potential of several therapeutics for the treatment of retinal diseases. Furthermore, this career development award will facilitate Dr. Babino’s development into an independent investigator by priming an R01 grant application. Project Narrative: Project Narrative: The prevalence of vision loss from retinal degeneration numbers in the millions world-wide and is expected to double by the year 2050, and despite the development of several promising approaches to restore vision in the blind, progress in developing these therapies has been hampered by challenges in analysis of these methods in animal models. We describe a novel system that analyzes, by machine learning, retinal ganglion cell output in native, degenerated and therapeutically treated blind retinas which can characterize the visual information content of the ‘reanimated’ blind retina and thereby facilitate the development of these technologies. The system developed through this grant, as well as the career development pursued by the investigator, will be readily applicable to the assessment of potential retinal acuity restoration by current and novel therapeutic approaches.",Assessment of murine retinal acuity ex vivo by machine learning of multielectrode array recordings,9943144,K99EY031333,"['Aftercare ', ' After Care ', ' After-Treatment ', ' post treatment ', ' Animals ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Contrast Sensitivity ', ' Visual Contrast Sensitivity ', ' Dissection ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Electroretinography ', ' electroretinogram ', ' Evolution ', ' Feedback ', ' Ganglia ', ' Neural Ganglion ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' In Vitro ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Leadership ', ' Learning ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Photoreceptors ', ' Photoreceptor Cell ', ' Photosensitive Cell ', ' Visual Receptor ', ' Psychophysics ', ' psychophysical ', ' rapid eye movement ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Retina ', ' Retinal Degeneration ', ' degenerative retina diseases ', ' retina degeneration ', ' retinal degenerative ', ' retinal degenerative diseases ', ' Retinal Diseases ', ' Retinal Disorder ', ' retina disease ', ' retina disorder ', ' retinopathy ', ' Retinal Ganglion Cells ', ' retinal ganglion ', ' Rhodopsin ', ' Visual Purple ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Saccades ', ' Saccadic Eye Movements ', ' Saccadic Pursuit ', ' Science ', ' Specificity ', ' stem cells ', ' Progenitor Cells ', ' Systems Analysis ', ' Systems Analyses ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Visual Acuity ', ' Washington ', ' Work ', ' Opsin ', ' Rod-Opsin ', ' Measures ', ' Synapsins ', ' Mediating ', ' promotor ', ' promoter ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' Cone Photoreceptors ', ' cone cell ', ' Retinal Cone ', ' KO mice ', ' Knock-out Mice ', ' Null Mouse ', ' Knockout Mice ', ' Training ', ' gangliocyte ', ' ganglion cell ', ' Amacrine Cells ', ' mimicry ', ' Stimulus ', ' Visual ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' non-human primate ', ' nonhuman primate ', ' Fostering ', ' Measurement ', ' Collaborations ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Rods and Cones ', ' Vertebrate Photoreceptors ', ' Knowledge ', ' green opsin ', ' middle-wavelength opsin ', ' MW opsin ', ' Scientist ', ' Scanning ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' cell type ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' restoration ', ' vision loss ', ' visual loss ', ' Blindness ', ' Viral ', ' interest ', ' Visual System ', ' Visual system structure ', ' light intensity ', ' mutant ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' tech development ', ' technology development ', ' transgenic ', ' Transgenic Organisms ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' behavioral test ', ' behavior test ', ' Voltage-Gated K+ Channels ', ' Voltage-Gated Potassium Channel ', ' Sampling ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' small molecule ', ' Data ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Ectopic Expression ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Measurable ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' K-Awards ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' wildtype mouse ', ' Wild Type Mouse ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Output ', ' vector ', ' Behavioral Assay ', ' scale up ', ' cost effective ', ' blind ', ' Prevalence ', ' murine model ', ' mouse model ', ' iPS ', ' iPSC ', ' iPSCs ', ' induced pluripotent stem cell ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' therapy development ', ' visual science ', ' vision science ', ' visual information ', ' new therapeutic approach ', ' new therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic strategies ', ' new therapy approaches ', ' novel therapeutic approach ', ' novel therapy approach ', ' novel therapeutic intervention ', ' effective intervention ', ' Systems Development ', ' optogenetics ', ' Cone ', ' multielectrode arrays ', ' multi-electrode arrays ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' Assessment tool ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' Retinal gene therapy ', ' Rod ', ' ']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K99,2020,113080,WA-07,-0.03277767892374006
"Integrating multidimensional genomic data to discover clinically-relevant predictive models The goal of this NIH Pathway to Independence award is to provide Dr. Brittany Lasseigne with an extensive training program to prepare her to be an effective independent investigator who uses computational genomics to study complex human diseases. We propose a formal one-year training and mentoring program in genomics, computer science, statistics, and career development to build on her 8+ years of hands-on training, followed by a three-year structured and independent research program. Research will focus on the integration of multidimensional genomic data sets in the context of complex human diseases. A critical barrier in genomic research is the complexity of data integration: the ability to leverage overlapping and unique information captured by different genomic assays would improve our understanding of data integration and generate clinically relevant genomic signatures. To meet this need, we propose to integrate a combination of genomic data we generated with public data to (1) infer genomic instability signatures from different data types, (2) improve clinically relevant phenotype prediction by building multi-omics machine learning classifiers and reducing phenotype heterogeneity, and (3) create a cloud-enabled R package and associated Shiny application to accelerate future research. The proposed work will advance our understanding of data integration, allow inference of genomic instabilities across data sets, and generate high performance classifiers for assessing clinically relevant phenotypes in both cancer and psychiatric disease using frameworks that will be broadly applicable across other complex diseases. It will also facilitate prioritization of experiments in future studies by informing on the orthogonality of genomic assays, thereby allowing more efficient study designs to capture as much information as possible within a given sample size or scope of experimentation. Collectively, this additional training will allow Dr. Lasseigne to develop new multidimensional data integration approaches and translational questions applicable across complex diseases when independent. Dr. Richard Myers (HudsonAlpha) and Dr. Gregory Cooper (HudsonAlpha), leaders in applying genetics and genomics to complex human diseases, and an Advisory Committee of additional experts including Dr. Barbara Wold (Caltech), Dr. Eddy Yang (UAB), and Dr. Timothy Reddy (Duke), will provide mentoring throughout this award. The mentored phase will take place at the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology, an ideal environment for this training with extensive translational science collaborations, expert faculty and staff, and state-of-the art computational and laboratory resources devoted to genomics. This combination will maximize Dr. Lasseigne's training program, facilitating her transition to an independent, tenure-track investigator at a university with a strong commitment to data-driven approaches to complex human disease research, i.e. strong genomics research programs with clinical collaborators, ideally at, or affiliated with, an academic medical center. Project Narrative The major outcome of this project will be a scientist with the necessary research, mentoring, teaching, and career development training to run an independent research program in computational genomics. The research proposed will apply novel strategies to further develop integrative machine learning analyses of multidimensional genomic data, discover clinically relevant predictive models, and create computational tools to accelerate future research.",Integrating multidimensional genomic data to discover clinically-relevant predictive models,9936223,R00HG009678,"['Academic Medical Centers ', ' University Medical Centers ', ' Award ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Biotechnology ', ' Biotech ', ' Budgets ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chromosomes ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Environment ', ' Faculty ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Institutes ', ' Laboratories ', ' Mentors ', ' Methodology ', ' Methylation ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Phenotype ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Running ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' statistics ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Testing ', ' Training Programs ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' promotor ', ' promoter ', ' Yang ', ' Lasso ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Task Forces ', ' advisory team ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Sample Size ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' programs ', ' Chemotherapy Protocol ', ' Chemotherapy Regimen ', ' Chemotherapy, Cancer, General ', ' Combination Chemotherapy Regimen ', ' Quimioterapia ', ' cancer chemotherapy ', ' Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' Cell Growth in Number ', ' Cell Multiplication ', ' Cellular Proliferation ', ' Cell Proliferation ', ' Performance ', ' computer science ', ' Structure ', ' Protein Gene Products ', ' Gene Proteins ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' Genomics ', ' Genome Instability ', ' Genomic Instability ', ' Microsatellite Instability ', ' Micro RNA ', ' miRNA ', ' miRNAs ', ' MicroRNAs ', ' Chromosome Instability ', ' Chromosomal Instability ', ' Systems Biology ', ' copy number variant ', ' copy number variation ', ' Copy Number Polymorphism ', ' CIMP ', ' CpG Island Methylator Phenotype ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' molecular profile ', ' molecular signature ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Research ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' protein metabolite ', ' Instruction ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' data integration ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' Coupling ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' Bioconductor ', ' human disease ', ' data reduction ', ' single cell sequencing ', ' tenure process ', ' tenure track ', ' multiomics ', ' multiple omics ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic classifier ', ' genomic signature ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' biomarker utility ', ' biomarker performance ', ' high dimensional data ', ' multidimensional datasets ', ' multidimensional data ', ' Visualization ', ' data framework ', ' learning classifier ', ' data standardization ', ' data standards ', ' ']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R00,2020,249000,AL-07,0.031555263478326635
"Reactome: An Open Knowledgebase of Human Pathways Project Summary  We seek renewal of the core operating funding for the Reactome Knowledgebase of Human Biological Pathways and Processes. Reactome is a curated, open access biomolecular pathway database that can be freely used and redistributed by all members of the biological research community. It is used by clinicians, geneti- cists, genomics researchers, and molecular biologists to interpret the results of high-throughput experimental studies, by bioinformaticians seeking to develop novel algorithms for mining knowledge from genomic studies, and by systems biologists building predictive models of normal and disease variant pathways.  Our curators, PhD-level scientists with backgrounds in cell and molecular biology work closely with in- dependent investigators within the community to assemble machine-readable descriptions of human biological pathways. Each pathway is extensively checked and peer-reviewed prior to publication to ensure its assertions are backed up by the primary literature, and that human molecular events inferred from orthologous ones in animal models have an auditable inference chain. Curated Reactome pathways currently cover 8930 protein- coding genes (44% of the translated portion of the genome) and ~150 RNA genes. We also offer a network of reliable ‘functional interactions’ (FIs) predicted by a conservative machine-learning approach, which covers an additional 3300 genes, for a combined coverage of roughly 60% of the known genome.  Over the next five years, we will: (1) curate new macromolecular entities, clinically significant protein sequence variants and isoforms, and drug-like molecules, and the complexes these entities form, into new reac- tions; (2) supplement normal pathways with alternative pathways targeted to significant diseases and devel- opmental biology; (3) expand and automate our tools for curation, management and community annotation; (4) integrate pathway modeling technologies using probabilistic graphical models and Boolean networks for pathway and network perturbation studies; (5) develop additional compelling software interfaces directed at both computational and lab biologist users; and (6) and improve outreach to bioinformaticians, molecular bi- ologists and clinical researchers. Project Narrative  Reactome represents one of a very small number of open access curated biological pathway databases. Its authoritative and detailed content has directly and indirectly supported basic and translational research studies with over-representation analysis and network-building tools to discover patterns in high-throughput data.

"Incorporating molecular network knowledge into predictive data-driven models Modern computational techniques based on machine-learning (ML) and, more recently, deep-learning (DL) are playing a critical role in realizing the precision medicine initiative. However, there is a critical need to systematically combine these powerful data-driven techniques with prior molecular network knowledge to make more accurate predictive models while also satisfactorily explaining their predictions in terms of mechanisms underlying complex traits and diseases. I propose to use domain specific knowledge from biology and computing to tackle three outstanding problems: 1) how to predict missing labels associated with millions of publicly available samples? 2) what molecular/cellular function can be attached to these samples and 3) how can we translate the findings from human data to a model species and back? ​Network-constrained Deep Learning for Metadata Imputation: ​​Most multifactorial phenotypes are tissue dependent and manifest differently depending on age, sex, and ethnicity. However, a majority of publicly-available genomic data lack these labels. I will develop a network-guided approach to predict missing metadata of samples based on their expression profiles by designing novel data-driven models where the model architecture and/or structure of the input data are constrained by an underlying gene network. ​Network-guided Functional Analysis of Genomic Data: ​​High-throughput experiments often generate lists of genes of interest that are hard to interpret. Functional enrichment analysis (FEA) is a powerful tool that attaches functional meaning to an experimental set of genes by summarizing them into sets of pathways/processes. However, standard FEA analysis is limited by incomplete knowledge of gene function, lack of context of the underlying gene network, and noise in expression data. I will address these limitations by developing a network-guided approach that jointly captures genes, their interactions, and their known biological pathways/processes into a common, low-dimensional space that facilitates deriving biological meaning by comparing the distance between the experimental gene set and the pathway/process of interest. ​Joint Multi-Species Genomic Data Analysis and Knowledge Transfer: ​​In particular, finding the optimal model system to use in a follow-up study based on genetic signatures derived from human experiments is challenging because genetic networks can be quite different from species to species. I propose to use data-driven models to embed heterogeneous networks comprised of human genes and model species genes into a common, low-dimensional space to better compare genetic signatures between two (or even multiple) species. I will apply these methods to three specific tasks, but I emphasize that the results of this study will be transferable to any other biological problem where complex gene/protein interactions are a major component. I have surrounded myself with a great support team and developed a strong professional development plan. The freedom and support provided by the F32 fellowship will be instrumental in achieving my goal of becoming a professor with an independent research group. This proposal aims to develop novel computational approaches that systematically combine prior molecular network knowledge, powerful data-driven computational techniques, and large transcriptome data collections to answer three critical questions in biomedicine: 1) how to predict missing labels associated with millions of publicly available samples? 2) what molecular/cellular function can be attached to these samples and 3) how can we translate the findings from human data to a model species and back? The core goal of my fellowship is to achieve this by infusing prior-knowledge into state-of-the-art data-driven statistical/machine learning methods so that we can overcome two major hurdles in studying complex, multifactorial traits and diseases: a) complex genetic interactions underlie multi-factorial traits and diseases, and b) these traits and diseases often differ in how they manifest from patient to patient.",Incorporating molecular network knowledge into predictive data-driven models,10022122,F32GM134595,"['Accounting ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Biology ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Collection ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Engineering ', ' Fellowship ', ' Follow-Up Studies ', ' Followup Studies ', ' Freedom ', ' Liberty ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Joints ', ' Methods ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Modernization ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' Biological ', ' Development Plans ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' Genetic ', ' gene function ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' human data ', ' professor ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Protein Gene Products ', ' Gene Proteins ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' functional genomics ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' genetic association ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Computational Technique ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' meta data ', ' Metadata ', ' disease phenotype ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' driving force ', ' math sciences ', ' mathematic sciences ', ' mathematical sciences ', ' Precision Medicine Initiative ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' transcriptome ', ' genomic profiles ', ' gene signatures ', ' genetic signature ', ' data into knowledge ', ' data to knowledge ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' genomic data ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' deep learning ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NIGMS,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,F32,2020,67446,MI-08,-0.0005452962097113051
"Improving the efficiency of randomized trials of behavioral interventions for acute and chronic respiratory failure The goal of this Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research is to enhance the ability of Dr. Scott Halpern to mentor students, residents, post-doctoral fellows, and junior faculty in developing and testing behavioral economic interventions to prevent and improve outcomes following, acute and chronic respiratory failure. Patients with many forms of acute and chronic respiratory failure, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), respectively, are at high risk of death and suffer considerable short- and long-term impairments in quality of life and functioning. Behavioral interventions, including those informed by behavioral economic principles, hold great promise for preventing these conditions and improving outcomes. Yet the knowledge produced by randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of such interventions is limited due to impediments to patient accrual, patient-centered outcomes ascertainment, and the abilities of traditional analyses to determine which interventions work best for which patients. By leveraging the conceptual models, research infrastructures, and data collected in 5 of Dr. Halpern's ongoing or recently completed RCTs including 40,000 patients, Dr. Halpern and his mentees will develop and test ways to surmount each of these three barriers to producing greater knowledge on how to prevent and treat acute and chronic respiratory failure. First, they will conduct randomized trials of “nudges” to improve enrollment and retention in real RCTs. Second, they will learn and apply state-of-the-art natural language processing and machine learning techniques to enhance the ability to extract patient-centered outcomes from electronic health records, thereby identifying more efficient methods for outcome ascertainment in large, pragmatic RCTs. Third, they will learn and apply modern methods in causal inference and the detection of heterogeneous treatment effects to better understand how effective behavioral interventions are overall, how efficacious they would be if more patients adhered to them, and which interventions work best for which patients. These scientific aims will be completed within the context of a structured training program designed to improve Dr. Halpern's skills in mentoring junior patient-oriented researchers. Dr. Halpern has already successfully mentored more than two dozen patient-oriented researchers. However, by enabling him to reduce his clinical and administrative commitments, this award will increase the time he commits to mentoring, and will improve his mentoring skills by supporting didactic training in influence and leadership and “mentor-the-mentor” meetings with more senior mentors. The award will also enable him to develop a “Junior Faculty Visiting Professor Program in Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine,” thereby enhancing opportunities for his and other established investigators' mentees to network with other leaders in the field, receive external feedback and mentorship, and gain the confidence that comes with speaking to less familiar audiences. NARRATIVE Randomized clinical trials of behavioral interventions are essential to the prevention and treatment of acute and chronic respiratory failure. However, the efficiency of such trials, defined as the knowledge gained divided by the costs of completing the trials, is often quite low due to impediments to patient accrual, patient-centered outcome ascertainment, and the abilities of traditional analytic approaches to determine which interventions work best for which patients. This mid-career investigator award in patient-oriented research will develop and test methods to surmount these three barriers in the context of a multifaceted training program that will make the Principal Investigator a more effective mentor and team leader.",Improving the efficiency of randomized trials of behavioral interventions for acute and chronic respiratory

"A comparison of firearm-related intimate partner homicide in Texas and Maryland: Prevalence, identification of those at risk, and the effect of firearm regulations Intimate partner homicide (IPH) accounts for one-fifth of U.S. homicides, with the majority of IPH and nearly all (91.6%) of intimate-partner related homicide-suicides (IPH-S) committed by firearms. While much is known about the frequency by which IPH is committed by firearms, research is far more limited regarding how victim/perpetrator firearm access, ownership, and behaviors affect IPH and IPH-S risk. We propose a case-control study in two states (Maryland and Texas) chosen to provide robust interstate firearm comparisons, as well as demographic, geographic and relevant law diversity. We will collect case file (medical examiner, police, prosecutor) and interview data to compare the histories of IPH victims (cases) to those of a random sample of individuals who experienced non-fatal physical IPV in the past two years (controls). The study will accomplish the following: (1) Obtain a count of firearm-related IPH and IPH-S across multiple subgroups through triangulation of data from multiple sources; (2) Describe the context of IPH and IPH-S, including precipitating events, relationship history, and perpetrator characteristics such as prior suicidality and prior substance abuse; (3) Assess the strength of firearm access, ownership, and/or use as risk factors for IPH and IPH-S, attending to intersections with risk factors at the family (e.g., abuse history), community (e.g., community violence), social and environmental levels (e.g., state firearm policies, accessibility of social services); (4) Identify differential patterns of risk between firearm-related and non-firearm related IPH, and between firearm-related IPH and IPH-S; (5) Examine patterns of gun ownership behaviors and attitudes in relation to IPH and IPH-S. We will create a database that will combine data across current data collection endeavors, creating a foundation for future funding. Findings will inform future evidence-based, multiple-level prevention interventions and allow policy makers and practitioners to develop and refine risk-informed approaches to reduce and prevent lethal IPV outcomes.

Findings will inform future evidence-based, multiple-level prevention interventions and allow policy makers and practitioners to develop and refine risk-informed approaches to reduce and prevent lethal intimate partner violence outcomes.","A comparison of firearm-related intimate partner homicide in Texas and Maryland: Prevalence, identification of those at risk, and the effect of firearm regulations",10166359,R61HD104570,"['Affect ', ' Attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Couples ', ' Data Collection ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Family ', ' Firearms ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Guns ', ' gun ', ' Habits ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Homicide ', ' Interview ', ' Laws ', ' male ', ' Maryland ', ' Medical Examiners ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Military Personnel ', ' Armed Forces Personnel ', ' Military ', ' Motivation ', ' Ownership ', ' Privatization ', ' Regression Analysis ', ' Regression Analyses ', ' Regression Diagnostics ', ' Statistical Regression ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Social Workers ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Texas ', ' Time ', ' Urban Population ', ' Veterans ', ' Violence ', ' violent ', ' violent behavior ', ' Weight ', ' Woman ', ' Native-Born ', ' Indigenous Population ', ' Native People ', ' Police ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Survivors ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Native Americans ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Partner Abuse ', ' Investigation ', ' Frequencies ', ' Event ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Pattern ', ' abused person ', ' abuse victim ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' experience ', ' criminal offender ', ' offender ', ' social ', ' abuse of substances ', ' substance abuse ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' Regulation ', ' commit suicide ', ' completed suicide ', ' accomplished suicide ', ' Sampling ', ' perpetrators ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Indigenous ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Subgroup ', ' Characteristics ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' intimate partner violence ', ' firearm violence ', ' gun violence ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Interdisciplinary Health Team ', ' evidence base ', ' firearm injury ', ' Gun injury ', ' multiple data sources ', ' data collection site ', ' COVID-19 epidemic ', ' COVID19 epidemic ', ' COVID19 pandemic ', ' corona virus disease 2019 epidemic ', ' corona virus disease 2019 pandemic ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic ', ' COVID-19 pandemic ', ' ']",NICHD,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R61,2020,1056501,MD-07,-0.002498352195965695
"The Effects of Insurance Benefit Design Innovation on Patient Health Abstract My research in health economics has focused on how information and targeted consumer cost-sharing influences how patients choose providers and the financial savings of incentivizing patients to choose low-price providers. I have also examined the opposite side of the market, how patient use of information and targeted consumer incentives spurs provider price competition. These topics provided the framework for my research as a PhD student in Health Economics at the University of California, Berkeley and I continue to build on these topics while a policy researcher at the RAND Corporation. A natural next step for my career is to expand this line of research but in a more in-depth manner and using more advanced statistical methods. Performing mentored research in these areas will help me successfully make the transition from directed to independent research. The proposed study will help me to (1) contribute to a deeper understanding of patient health effects of an innovative insurance benefit design that is particularly relevant for the aging population; (2) continue to build capabilities working with large medical claims data sets and develop expertise in innovative statistical methods from different disciplines; (3) gain training in aging-related health-services research; (4) expand my exposure to the aging, health economics, and health services research communities; and (5) develop my abilities as an independent health services researcher and build the foundations to successfully compete for R01-level grants.  In this project, I propose to examine whether reference pricing for colonoscopies and pharmaceuticals decreases adherence to recommended colorectal cancer screening and medication therapies among the near- elderly population. I will also examine the impact of reference pricing on patient health outcomes and the aging process. To do so, I intend to apply novel machine-learning statistical methods that have been recently developed in the computer science and statistics fields. As part of this proposal, I have built a formal training plan to develop expertise in these methods. This project will provide me with the flexibility and support to develop a long-term research agenda that focuses on using innovative statistical methods to evaluate the comprehensive effects of consumer cost- sharing programs. Although this study focuses on a single cost- sharing program, reference pricing, the skills I gain through this award will allow me to independently lead evaluations of future benefit designs. The application of machine-learning methods to the setting of reference pricing will provide a framework that I or other researchers can use to evaluate other insurance benefit designs or alternative patient populations. ! Narrative An increasingly popular insurance benefit design, reference pricing, provides targeted financial incentives for consumers to receive care at low-cost providers. While the financial savings from reference pricing programs are well-known, the health impacts have yet to be studied. The proposed career grant will apply machine learning techniques to develop a long-term research agenda focused on understanding the patient health effects of reference pricing for colonoscopies and medication therapies, which are services that are especially relevant for the aging population. !",The Effects of Insurance Benefit Design Innovation on Patient Health,9891936,K01AG061274,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' California ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Colonoscopy ', ' Communities ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Deductibles ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health Services ', ' Health Services Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' services research ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incentives ', ' Inpatients ', ' Insurance ', ' Insurance Benefits ', ' Insurance Carriers ', ' Insurers ', ' Internal Medicine ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' New England ', ' Northeastern United States ', ' Patients ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publishing ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Retirement ', ' Savings ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Price ', ' pricing ', ' Cost Sharing ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Benefit ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' Magazine ', ' Journals ', ' Task Forces ', ' advisory team ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' CRC screening ', ' colo-rectal cancer detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer early detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer screening ', ' colorectal cancer detection ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' detect colo-rectal cancer ', ' detect colorectal cancer ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' Exposure to ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Side ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Services ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' computer science ', ' Employee ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' response ', ' Provider ', ' Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' Patient Compliance ', ' patient adherence ', ' patient cooperation ', ' therapy compliance ', ' therapy cooperation ', ' treatment compliance ', ' compliance behavior ', ' Adherence ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cost ', ' health economics ', ' asthma patient ', ' asthmatic patient ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' treatment effect ', ' aged population ', ' population aging ', ' aging population ', ' patient population ', ' financial reward ', ' monetary incentive ', ' financial incentive ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' Ph D student ', ' Ph D. student ', ' Ph.

"Systems biology of quiescence entry Abstract This proposal aims to provide crucial training for the candidate’s long-term career plan to study how cellular quiescence is established through decision-making processes. The decision to undergo quiescence in response to stress or developmental signals is a fundamental and understudied property of living systems. Failure to maintain quiescence can lead to cell proliferation disorders in humans, such as fibrosis or cancer. Quiescence entry is triggered when multiple nutrient- and stress-sensing signaling pathways arrest the cell cycle machinery. However, the molecular mechanisms that coordinate stress response pathways with the cell cycle during quiescence remain largely unclear. This is, in part, due to the difficulties to simultaneously quantify multiple stress pathways at the single cell level in vivo. To solve this limitation, the candidate will use a microfluidics- fluorescent imaging system that tracks up to six different pathways simultaneously during the transition from proliferation into quiescence. Using this approach, the coordination between stress responses and the cell cycle machinery can be quantified with unprecedented temporal resolution in the model organism S. cerevisiae. A computational platform based on machine learning and time series analysis will be used to process the large imaging data derived from tracking six biomarkers simultaneously in single cells. An initial version of this framework found that during the onset of quiescence the nuclear levels of the conserved DNA-replication kinase Cdc7 are dynamically regulated. This approach also identified that the nuclear levels of the stress-activated transcriptional repressor Xbp1 define how the cell cycle is stopped during quiescence entry. Combining this computational approach with biochemical techniques will determine the molecular mechanisms for the establishment of cellular quiescence by modulation of stress responses and the cell cycle machinery. The candidate is to acquire crucial training in computational biology during the K99 phase of this proposal to complement his previous training in biochemistry, cell biology and yeast genetics. The candidate will be mentored by a leader in computational biology Dr. Gaudenz Danuser, whose lab develops advanced machine learning and time series analysis to study cellular signal transduction. This proposal harnesses the commitment of an entire bioinformatics core facility and the training environment of a world-class research institution at UTSW. Establishing a unique computational and imaging framework, combined with biochemical approaches for the study of quiescence, will support the candidate’s transition to an independent research academic position and will lead to the discovery of biomedically relevant principles of quiescence and cell cycle regulation. Narrative The precise integration of stress signals during the establishment of cellular quiescence is crucial to prevent cell proliferation disorders, such as fibrosis and cancer. However, it is unclear how stress responses are integrated during quiescence, in part, because of a lack of methods for simultaneously quantifying multiple stress pathways in single cells. To solve this problem, the proposed work will combine machine learning approaches with six color fluorescent microscopy to reveal the mechanisms by which stress responses coordinate

"Privacy-preserving genomic medicine at scale 1 Project Summary  2  3 High-throughput sequencing, biomedical imaging, and electronic health record technologies are 4 generating health-related datasets of unprecedented scale. Integrative analysis of these  5 resources promises to reveal new biology and drive personal and precision medicine. Yet, the  6 sensitive nature of these data often requires that they be kept in isolated silos, limiting their 7 usefulness to science. The goal of this project is to develop innovative privacy-preserving  8 algorithms to enable data sharing and drive genomic medicine. Crucially, we will draw upon our  9 past success in secure genome analysis and algorithmic expertise in computational biology to 10 address the imminent need to perform complex integrative analyses securely and at scale. 11 Current privacy-preserving tools are prohibitively too costly to perform the complex 12 calculations required in genomic analysis. We previously leveraged the highly structured nature 13 of biological data and novel optimization strategies to implement efficient pipelines for secure 14 genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and drug interaction predictions which scaled to 15 millions of samples. In this project, we will further exploit the unique properties of biomedical data 16 to: (i) develop secure integrative analysis methods for genomic medicine; (ii) develop an easy-to- 17 use programming environment with advanced automated optimizations to facilitate the adoption 18 of privacy-preserving analyses; and (iii) promote the use of our privacy techniques to gain novel 19 biological insights through large-scale collaborative genetic studies of multi-ethnic cohorts. 20 With co-I’s Amarasinghe (MIT) and Cho (Broad Institute), we aim to apply these tools to 21 realize the first multi-institution, multi-national secure genetic studies with our partners at the 22 Swiss Personalized Health Network, UK Biobank, Finnish FinnGen, All of Us, NIH NCBI, Broad 23 and Barcelona Supercomputing Center (Letters of Support). We will also use our privacy- 24 preserving approaches to study genomic origins of polygenic traits for disease as well as 25 neuroimaging and other clinical phenotypes. We will continue to actively integrate our methods 26 into community standards (MPEG-G, GA4GH). 27 Successful completion of these aims will result in computational methods and open-source, 28 easy-to-use, production-grade implementations that open the door to secure integration and 29 analysis of massive sets of sensitive genomic and clinical data. With input from our collaborations, 30 we will build these tools and apply them to better understand the molecular causes of human 31 health and its translation to the clinic. Project Narrative Combining genomic and health-related data from millions of patients will empower the development of clinically relevant measures of human health and disease risks. However, this task requires securely sharing sensitive data at an immense scale beyond what existing cryptographic platforms can achieve.

"Center for Undiagnosed Diseases at Stanford Abstract The Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) has increased access for patients with undiagnosed diseases to the nation’s leading clinicians and scientists. Phase II of the Network will facilitate the transition of UDN efforts toward sustainability, through the expansion of clinical sites, refinement of methods, and integration with regular clinical practice. Here, we propose a program of study that will (1) facilitate timely, accurate diagnosis of patients with undiagnosed diseases; (2) improve diagnostic rates through novel approaches to data analysis and integration; and (3) explore underlying mechanisms of disease to accelerate therapeutic drug discovery. In Aim 1, we propose to evaluate patients referred to the UDN through a protocol that includes pre-visit chart review and genetic counseling followed by an individualized visit during which standardized phenotypic and environmental data are collected. Biosamples facilitate genomic, multi-omic, and cellular evaluation of disease. Expansion of fibroblasts and, in selected cases, generation of induced Pluripotent Stem Cell (iPSC) lines facilitates scientific investigation of the underlying diseases. We will expand our program of patient outreach, particularly to under-served populations. We will extend our UDN-based genomic medicine educational program both in scope and by broadening its eligibility. In Aim 2, we propose to develop and implement novel methods in areas of high potential to increase diagnostic yield. This includes algorithms for the detection of small genomic insertions and deletions as well as large scale structural variation. We will develop alignment algorithms using graph reference genomes and promote the use of long-read sequencing technologies. We will apply machine learning to the systematic integration of RNA sequencing, metabolomic, and phenotypic data with the electronic medical record and the entire medical literature to improve diagnostic yield. In Aim 3, we propose to facilitate diagnosis through enhanced cellular and model organisms phenotyping. We will implement immunomic and metagenomic approaches such as T cell, B cell and unknown organism sequencing for undiagnosed cases. We will utilize methods for moderate- and high-throughput phenotyping of iPS-derived cells and promote novel drug discovery via high throughput drug screening both with FDA- approved drugs and large scale small molecule libraries. Beyond Phase II, Stanford Medicine has made a strong commitment to the continuation of the Center for Undiagnosed Diseases at Stanford through a multi- million dollar institutional commitment. In summary, we aim to build on the success of Phase I of the UDN by streamlining processes, maximizing collaboration and outreach, optimizing computational algorithms, extending scientific investigation towards therapeutic discovery, and promoting engagement of hospital leaders, clinicians, scientists, policy-makers, and philanthropists to ensure this national resource is sustained long beyond the duration of this award. Narrative We will refine the operations of the Center for Undiagnosed Diseases at Stanford in coordination with other Phase II sites of the Undiagnosed Diseases Network to diagnose the undiagnosed and facilitate a transition to sustainability. Our Center will bring Stanford’s long history in technology development, genomic data analysis, stem cell biology, and translational science to the team-based diagnosis and care of patients with undiagnosed disease.

"UW 4-Dimensional Genomic Organization of Mammalian Embryogenesis Center Project Summary / Abstract A major shortcoming of most efforts to understand the 4D nucleome is that they have mainly focused on in vitro cell lines, rather than on dynamic, in vivo systems. Arguably, the most important in vivo system, which also happens to be the most dynamic, is development itself, wherein the nucleome both shapes and is shaped by the initial emergence of the myriad mammalian cell types. While these in vivo dynamics are presently poorly documented and understood, recently emerged technologies offer a path forward. Here we propose to establish the University of Washington 4-Dimensional Genomic Nuclear Organization of Mammalian Embryogenesis Center (UW 4D GENOME Center), which will address these massive gaps in our understanding by generating systematic datasets on nuclear morphology and associated molecular measurements in mammalian tissues and cell types. These datasets will be generated in the context of the leading model organism for mammalian development, the mouse. Our approach focuses on following nuclear structure, chromatin and gene expression changes at a “whole organism” scale, using a combination of scalable single cell profiling and “visual cell sorting” (VCS) methods, all well-established and mostly developed in our own labs. Our goal is to generate a high- resolution 4DN atlas of mouse embryogenesis for the community. The different types of data will be integrated, including cross-species imputation to integrate with human data, as well as models and navigable maps applied to pathways relevant to mammalian development. Project Narrative The UW 4D Genome Organization of Mammalian Embryogenesis Center (UW 4D GENOME) aims to elucidate chromatin dynamics during the early stages of mammalian development. Accordingly, the proposed center will carry out systematic generation of sequencing and imaging data during mouse embryogenesis, summarizing and visualizing the resulting data using machine learning models.

"What comes next? Engaging stakeholders in governance of participant data and relationships during the sunset of large genomic medicine research initiatives Abstract The Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) has increased access for patients with undiagnosed diseases to the nation’s leading clinicians and scientists. Phase II of the Network will facilitate the transition of UDN efforts toward sustainability, through the expansion of clinical sites, refinement of methods, and integration with regular clinical practice. Here, we propose a program of study that will (1) facilitate timely, accurate diagnosis of patients with undiagnosed diseases; (2) improve diagnostic rates through novel approaches to data analysis and integration; and (3) explore underlying mechanisms of disease to accelerate therapeutic drug discovery. In Aim 1, we propose to evaluate patients referred to the UDN through a protocol that includes pre-visit chart review and genetic counseling followed by an individualized visit during which standardized phenotypic and environmental data are collected. Biosamples facilitate genomic, multi-omic, and cellular evaluation of disease. Expansion of fibroblasts and, in selected cases, generation of induced Pluripotent Stem Cell (iPSC) lines facilitates scientific investigation of the underlying diseases. We will expand our program of patient outreach, particularly to under-served populations. We will extend our UDN-based genomic medicine educational program both in scope and by broadening its eligibility. In Aim 2, we propose to develop and implement novel methods in areas of high potential to increase diagnostic yield. This includes algorithms for the detection of small genomic insertions and deletions as well as large scale structural variation. We will develop alignment algorithms using graph reference genomes and promote the use of long-read sequencing technologies. We will apply machine learning to the systematic integration of RNA sequencing, metabolomic, and phenotypic data with the electronic medical record and the entire medical literature to improve diagnostic yield. In Aim 3, we propose to facilitate diagnosis through enhanced cellular and model organisms phenotyping. We will implement immunomic and metagenomic approaches such as T cell, B cell and unknown organism sequencing for undiagnosed cases. We will utilize methods for moderate- and high-throughput phenotyping of iPS-derived cells and promote novel drug discovery via high throughput drug screening both with FDA- approved drugs and large scale small molecule libraries. Beyond Phase II, Stanford Medicine has made a strong commitment to the continuation of the Center for Undiagnosed Diseases at Stanford through a multi- million dollar institutional commitment. In summary, we aim to build on the success of Phase I of the UDN by streamlining processes, maximizing collaboration and outreach, optimizing computational algorithms, extending scientific investigation towards therapeutic discovery, and promoting engagement of hospital leaders, clinicians, scientists, policy-makers, and philanthropists to ensure this national resource is sustained long beyond the duration of this award. Narrative We will refine the operations of the Center for Undiagnosed Diseases at Stanford in coordination with other Phase II sites of the Undiagnosed Diseases Network to diagnose the undiagnosed and facilitate a transition to sustainability. Our Center will bring Stanford’s long history in technology development, genomic data analysis, stem cell biology, and translational science to the team-based diagnosis and care of patients with undiagnosed disease. We will refine existing procedures to further optimize the diagnostic process and integrate care of the undiagnosed into clinical practice while preserving the scientific mission of the Undiagnosed Diseases Network.",What comes next?

"Identifying drug synergistic with cancer immunotherapy PROJECT SUMMARY Avinash D Sahu, Ph.D., is a computational biologist whose overarching career goal is to solve longstanding problems in cancer immunology and translational precision oncology using artificial intelligence (AI) and to devise new therapeutic strategies for late-stage cancer patients. Entitled Identifying drug synergistic with cancer immunotherapy, the proposed research combines cutting-edge AI technology with Immuno-oncology (IO) to produce a systematic approach to identifying drugs that synergize with immunotherapy, and prioritize them for clinical trials for advanced melanoma, bladder, kidney, and lung cancer. Career development plan: Dr. Sahu is a recipient of the Michelson Prize, and his research mission is to initiate precision immuno-oncology by moving patients away from palliative chemotherapy to more personalized IO treatments. His previous training in AI, statistics, method development, cancer, and translation biology have prepared him to conduct the proposed research. Dr. Sahu has outlined specific training activities to expand his skill set in four areas: 1) cancer immunology, 2) AI, 3) translation research and 4) new immunological assays. This skill set will be necessary to gain research independence. Mentors/Environment: Dr. Sahu mentoring and the advisory team assembles world-leading experts in computational biology, translation and clinical research, AI, statistics, and immunology. Also, Dr. Sahu has developed academic collaborations and industry partners to provide him experimental support for the proposal. Leveraging the state-of-art software and google-cloud infrastructure provided by Cancer Immune Data Commons (CIDC); computational resources from DFCI, Harvard, and Broad Institute; as well as unique access to largest immunotherapy patient data from collaborators, Dr. Sahu is uniquely placed to identify most promising IO drug combinations. Research: There is a lack of a principled approach to identify promising IO drug combinations that has often led to arbitrarily designed IO clinical trials without a sound biological basis. The proposal formulates the first in silico predictor to estimate drug’s immunomodulatory effect and potential to synergize with immunotherapies. Aim 1 builds a novel deep learning predictor —DeepImmune— to predict immunotherapy response from transcriptomes. Aim 2 estimates the immunomodulatory effects of drugs from for its drug-induced transcriptomic changes using DeepImmune. Aim 3 prioritize top predicted immunomodulatory drugs and validate their effect in pre-clinical models. Outcomes/Impact: The successful completion of the proposal will result in a robust predictor to rationally combine cancer therapies with immunotherapy and set the basis for a clinical trial to test the most promising combination therapy. The career development award and mentored research will enable Dr. Sahu to become a leader in the new field of research at the intersection of precision immuno-oncology and AI. PROJECT NARRATIVE Combining immunotherapies with other cancer drugs has emerged as a new hope for late-stage cancer patients, however, the lack of a principled approach to identify such effective combinations often led to poorly designed clinical trials. The proposed research engages state-of-art Artificial Intelligence techniques with drug-induced transcriptomic changes to identify drugs that synergize with immunotherapies and prioritize them for clinical trials. Its application, as well as the career development pursued by the investigator, will rationalize clinical trials, identify new treatments for advanced cancers, and advance precision

"Neural Biomarkers of ECT Response in Schizophrenia PROJECT SUMMARY This is an application for an NIMH Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) entitled ""Neural Biomarkers of ECT Response in Schizophrenia."" In this application, Dr. Miklos Argyelan proposes a comprehensive plan for transitioning into an independent translational researcher focused on understanding the neural mechanisms of treatment response in schizophrenia by integrating functional neuroimaging with neuromodulatory bioelectric treatment approaches. Despite its effectiveness and intensive research, the mechanism of action for ECT remains unknown, and currently no clinical or biological biomarkers exist to predict response. In patients with schizophrenia undergoing a trial of ECT (with bitemporal electrode placement), the proposed study will use resting-state functional MRI, as well as electrical field modeling as applied to structural MRI scans, to examine the neural circuitry underlying clinical response. Patients will undergo MRI scanning at baseline, and after the 8th ECT treatment. Results of this proposal may lead to biomarkers that will optimize treatment algorithms for schizophrenia with higher efficacy. Identifying target mechanisms would not only improve the current deployment of bioelectric approaches as part of a “precision medicine” approach, but could also lead to the development of novel therapies. This line of research will be conducted under the guidance of mentors who are recognized experts in the biomarker research of schizophrenia (Anil K. Malhotra, M.D.), neuromodulation (Georgios Petrides, M.D., Marom Bikson Ph.D.), neuroimaging of ECT (Chris Abbott, M.D.) and analyzing high dimensional datasets (Jing Sui, PhD.). Concurrently, Dr Argyelan will engage in a comprehensive training program which is fully integrated with the research study in the proposal. The training plan contains three domains with corresponding goals: (1) to gain further expertise in designing and conducting clinical trials in schizophrenia, (2) to expand my knowledge in machine learning algorithms, and (3) to learn more about electrical field (EF) modeling techniques. The combination of training in clinical trials, machine learning and neuromodulation will support the planned research to provide the framework to explore and validate biomarkers of disease and treatment response. The culmination of these training activities, combined with the planned research aims under this award, will prepare Dr. Argyelan to develop into an independent translational researcher and to submit a planned R01 in personalized neuromodulation. PROJECT NARRATIVE Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has been consistently shown to be an effective augmentation strategy in the treatment of schizophrenia, however its mechanism of action remains unknown, and there are no clinical or biological predictors to predict response. The overall goal of this K23 proposal is to examine the functional neural circuitry that underlies successful treatment with ECT, which may lead to the identification of biomarkers that will allow for more efficient use of ECT, as well as additional treatment targets for patients with refractory illness.

"Center for Undiagnosed Diseases at Stanford Abstract The Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) has increased access for patients with undiagnosed diseases to the nation’s leading clinicians and scientists. Phase II of the Network will facilitate the transition of UDN efforts toward sustainability, through the expansion of clinical sites, refinement of methods, and integration with regular clinical practice. Here, we propose a program of study that will (1) facilitate timely, accurate diagnosis of patients with undiagnosed diseases; (2) improve diagnostic rates through novel approaches to data analysis and integration; and (3) explore underlying mechanisms of disease to accelerate therapeutic drug discovery. In Aim 1, we propose to evaluate patients referred to the UDN through a protocol that includes pre-visit chart review and genetic counseling followed by an individualized visit during which standardized phenotypic and environmental data are collected. Biosamples facilitate genomic, multi-omic, and cellular evaluation of disease. Expansion of fibroblasts and, in selected cases, generation of induced Pluripotent Stem Cell (iPSC) lines facilitates scientific investigation of the underlying diseases. We will expand our program of patient outreach, particularly to under-served populations. We will extend our UDN-based genomic medicine educational program both in scope and by broadening its eligibility. In Aim 2, we propose to develop and implement novel methods in areas of high potential to increase diagnostic yield. This includes algorithms for the detection of small genomic insertions and deletions as well as large scale structural variation. We will develop alignment algorithms using graph reference genomes and promote the use of long-read sequencing technologies. We will apply machine learning to the systematic integration of RNA sequencing, metabolomic, and phenotypic data with the electronic medical record and the entire medical literature to improve diagnostic yield. In Aim 3, we propose to facilitate diagnosis through enhanced cellular and model organisms phenotyping. We will implement immunomic and metagenomic approaches such as T cell, B cell and unknown organism sequencing for undiagnosed cases. We will utilize methods for moderate- and high-throughput phenotyping of iPS-derived cells and promote novel drug discovery via high throughput drug screening both with FDA- approved drugs and large scale small molecule libraries. Beyond Phase II, Stanford Medicine has made a strong commitment to the continuation of the Center for Undiagnosed Diseases at Stanford through a multi- million dollar institutional commitment. In summary, we aim to build on the success of Phase I of the UDN by streamlining processes, maximizing collaboration and outreach, optimizing computational algorithms, extending scientific investigation towards therapeutic discovery, and promoting engagement of hospital leaders, clinicians, scientists, policy-makers, and philanthropists to ensure this national resource is sustained long beyond the duration of this award. Narrative We will refine the operations of the Center for Undiagnosed Diseases at Stanford in coordination with other Phase II sites of the Undiagnosed Diseases Network to diagnose the undiagnosed and facilitate a transition to sustainability. Our Center will bring Stanford’s long history in technology development, genomic data analysis, stem cell biology, and translational science to the team-based diagnosis and care of patients with undiagnosed disease. We will refine existing procedures to further optimize the diagnostic process and integrate care of the undiagnosed into clinical practice while preserving the scientific mission of the Undiagnosed Diseases Network.",Center for Undiagnosed Diseases at Stanford,10124880,U01HG010218,"['Algorithms ', ' Award ', ' B-Lymphocytes ', ' B blood cells ', ' B cell ', ' B cells ', ' B-Cells ', ' B-cell ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Cell Line ', ' CellLine ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Eligibility ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Family ', ' Fibroblasts ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Genetic Counseling ', ' Goals ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Investments ', ' Leadership ', ' Libraries ', ' Literature ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Organoids ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Reagent ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Robotics ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Standardization ', ' T-Lymphocyte ', ' T-Cells ', ' thymus derived lymphocyte ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Universities ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Generations ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' specimen collection ', ' sample collection ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Collaborations ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Committee Membership ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Investigation ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' Visit ', ' meetings ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' chemical library ', ' small molecule libraries ', ' Gene Inactivation ', ' transcriptional silencing ', ' Gene Silencing ', ' cohort ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' tech development ', ' technology development ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Graph ', ' outreach ', ' Modeling ', ' Genomics ', ' drug discovery ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' Consent ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' International ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' clinical test ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Ontology ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Research ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Process ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' indel ', ' insertion-deletion ', ' insertion-deletion mutation ', ' insertion/deletion ', ' insertion/deletion mutation ', ' data integration ', ' under served population ', ' underserved people ', ' Underserved Population ', ' next generation ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' clinical site ', ' clinical research site ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Cellular model ', ' Cell model ', ' Functional Metagenomics ', ' Metagenomics ', ' computer algorithm ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' Network-based ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' iPS ', ' iPSC ', ' iPSCs ', ' induced pluripotent stem cell ', ' FDA approved ', ' stem cell biology ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' genome-wide ', ' clinical practice ', ' operation ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' screening ', ' accurate diagnosis ', ' support network ', ' multiomics ', ' multiple omics ', ' Genomic medicine ', ' reference assembly ', ' reference genome ', ' phenotypic data ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' genomic data ', ' patient outreach ', ' preservation ', ' Child Health ', ' deep learning ', ' multiple omic data ', ' Multiomic Data ', ' virtual screenings ', ' virtual screening ', ' variant detection ', ' high-throughput drug screening ', ' ']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U01,2020,50000,CA-18,0.009120490261998026
"New Jersey Alliance for Clinical Translational Science: NJ ACTS Contact PD/PI: Panettieri, Reynold Alexander Project Summary/Abstract Overview Coordinated by Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences (RBHS), the New Jersey Alliance for Clinical and Translational Science (NJ ACTS) comprises a consortium with Rutgers and Princeton Universities (PU), NJ Institute for Technology (NJIT), medical, nursing, dental and public health schools, hospitals, community health centers, outpatient practices, industry, policymakers and health information exchanges. All Alliance universities and affiliates have provided substantial resources and contributed to the planning, development and leadership of the consortium. With access to ~7 million people, NJ ACTS serves as a ‘natural laboratory’ for translational and clinical research. With a state population of ~9 million, New Jersey ranks 11th in the US, 1st in population density and higher than average in racial and ethnic diversity. Surprisingly, NJ has no CTSA Hub to coordinate translational and clinical research. Our CTSA Hub focuses on two overarching themes: the heterogeneity of disease pathogenesis and response to treatment, and the value of linking large clinical databases with interventional clinical investigations to identify cause-and-effect and predict therapeutic responses. NJ ACTS will provide: innovative approaches to link information from large databases and electronic health records to inform clinical trial design, execution and analysis; and novel platforms for biomarker discovery using fluorescence in situ hybridization and machine learning to identify unique neural signatures of chronic illness. NJ ACTS will access a large health system with significant member diversity; a rich legacy of community engagement and community-based research platforms; and proven approaches to enhance workforce development in clinical research. With a substantial investment in streamlining research administration and IRB practices at Rutgers and with the inception of NJ ACTS, there exists an unparalleled opportunity for logarithmic growth in clinical research in New Jersey. To build our capacity for participant and clinical interactions as a CTSA Hub, the newly established Trial Accelerator and Recruitment Office will coordinate feasibility assessment, implementation, recruitment, and evaluation of clinical studies. Additionally, our organization of five clinical research units into a cohesive network provides extraordinary expertise in strategic locations to enhance participant recruitment from diverse communities with a particular focus on: children; the elderly; those with serious mental illness or substance abuse issues; low-income individuals served by Medicaid; those with HIV/AIDS; and people of all ages who are minorities, underserved, and victims of health and environmental disparities. With a history of collaboration, partners and affiliates share unique skills, expertise, training and mentoring capabilities that will be greatly amplified within the infrastructure of a CTSA Hub. Princeton and NJIT, without medical schools or hospital affiliates, seeks collaboration with Rutgers to provide clinical research platforms; Rutgers seeks the PU and NJIT expertise in novel informatics platforms, expertise in natural language and ontology, machine learning and cognitive neurosciences. Together NJ ACTS will provide an alliance that will catalyze clinical research and training across New Jersey to improve population health and contribute to the CTSA Consortium. In this revised application, the overall themes remain unchanged but Cores leadership and direction has been markedly refined.

"Studying pseudogout using naturallanguage processing and novelimaging approaches Candidate: Dr. Tedeschi is an Instructor in Medicine at Harvard Medical School (HMS) and Associate Physician in the Division of Rheumatology, Immunology and Allergy’s Section of Clinical Sciences (SCS) at Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH). She received an MPH from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health (HSPH). Her 10 first-author manuscripts, two BWH grants, and foundation award exemplify her productivity and commitment to research. She has assembled an experienced team of mentors and collaborators, led by Dr. Daniel Solomon (primary mentor) and Drs. Katherine Liao and Karen Costenbader (co-mentors), to guide her training in natural language processing and machine learning approaches for clinical research, analysis of linked electronic medical record (EMR) and Medicare claims data, and interpretation of advanced imaging modalities. Focused coursework at HSPH and HMS will complement the experience she gains through her proposed studies of pseudogout risk factors and long-term outcomes. Training in dual- energy CT and ultrasound interpretation for crystalline arthritis will be obtained via one-on-one sessions. Her long-term career goal is to become an independent patient-oriented investigator focused on pseudogout. Environment: Dr. Tedeschi has a commitment from her Division for >75% protected time for research and career development activities during the K23 award period. Support from the Division and her primary mentor’s research funds will supplement her salary and project-related expenses. The SCS, a collaborative clinical research group in the Division of Rheumatology, has extensive infrastructure including the VERITY Bioinformatics Core (NIH-P30-AR072577, PI: Solomon) that will provide resources and expertise for the proposed studies. In addition, the BWH Arthritis Center is one of the largest nationally, facilitating subject recruitment, and the BWH Division of Musculoskeletal Imaging has state-of-the-art equipment and expertise applying dual-energy CT in crystalline arthritis. Coursework at HSPH and HMS, adjacent to BWH, will provide training necessary for Dr. Tedeschi’s development into an independent investigator. Research: Dr. Tedeschi’s long-term objective is to prevent and reduce morbidity from pseudogout, an understudied, painful crystalline arthritis that affects 8-10 million Americans. She will use natural language processing and machine learning approaches to enhance an algorithm for identifying pseudogout in EMR data. She will study risk factors for and long-term outcomes in pseudogout, harnessing vast amounts of information contained in Partners HealthCare EMR data and Medicare claims data, and will gain experience working with linked datasets. Dr. Tedeschi will recruit subjects with pseudogout and other types of mono- and oligoarthritis to test and compare the performance of dual-energy CT scanning, musculoskeletal ultrasound, and x-ray for identifying pseudogout. Her proposed K23 projects will lead to manuscripts and data to be leveraged in an R01 application focused on pseudogout during the award period, leading to independence as a patient-oriented investigator. Project Narrative The proposed studies will contribute fundamental knowledge about pseudogout, a common, painful crystalline arthritis for which we have little prognostic information and no targeted treatments. Results from the proposed projects could lead to methods for non-invasive, accurate pseudogout diagnosis, development of preventive strategies for pseudogout, and interventions to reduce cardiovascular disease risk. Future work stemming from the proposed projects may include predictive models of pseudogout flares, identification of serum biomarkers for pseudogout, and development of outcomes measures to be used in prospectively recruited pseudogout cohort studies.",Studying pseudogout using naturallanguage processing and novelimaging approaches,9882206,K23AR075070,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms

"Proteogenomics-driven therapeutic discovery in hepatocellular carcinoma Project Summary  Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide, and therapeutic options are limited. There is a pressing need to fully understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease in order to identify new effective biomarkers, drug targets, and therapeutic agents for the prognosis and treatment of HCC. Proteins are the functional molecules of the cell, and many clinically validated biomarkers and most drug targets are proteins; however, cancer omics studies have relied primarily on genomic platforms. By melding genomics with mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics, the new field of proteogenomics provides an opportunity to more completely understand how somatic genomes activate aberrant protein networks that drive cancer pathogenesis. A major National Cancer Institute (NCI)-funded initiative, the Clinical Proteomics Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC), and the more recently established International Cancer Proteogenome Consortium (ICPC), are promoting an integrated proteogenomics approach that is postulated to produce sounder therapeutic hypotheses and a new generation of protein biomarkers. The central purpose of this application is to forge a collaboration between a CPTAC team in the US and an ICPC team in China to enable proteogenomics-driven therapeutic discoveries in hepatitis B virus-related (HBV+) HCC, which attributes to 85% of HCC cases in China. The two teams bring complementary expertise required for a successful proteogenomic study of HCC. The China team has already generated the most comprehensive multi-omics dataset yet produced for liver cancer by applying proteogenomic profiling to a Chinese HBV+ HCC cohort (CHCC-HBV) with 159 cases, and the data has been preliminarily analyzed through collaborative efforts between the two teams. In this application, the US team will perform deep computational analyses of the proteogenomics data to generate prognostic models and therapeutic hypotheses, which will be experimentally validated in cell lines, animal models, and clinical specimens by the China team. Our specific Aims are: Aim 1) To develop and validate a protein-based prognostic model; Aim 2) To identify and validate subtype-specific causal drivers and therapeutic strategies; and Aim 3) To characterize the immune landscape of HBV+ HCC. Successful completion of this project will lead to new knowledge on HCC biology as well as new prognostic and treatment strategies for HBV+ HCC. Meanwhile, experimentally validated computational methods developed in this project will have wide application to the study of other cancers and other non-cancer diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HBV+ HCC) attributes to 85% of all HCC cases in China, and therapeutic options are limited. This project will forge a collaboration between a computational team in the US and an HCC oncology team in China to perform comprehensive molecular characterization of a large Chinese HBV+ HCC cohort using the new proteogenomic approach that systematically integrates genomics and mass spectrometry-based proteomics data. This collaborative project will produce new biomarkers, drug targets, and therapeutic agents for the prognosis and treatment of HCC as well as experimentally validated computational methods that can

"Center for Modeling Complex Interactions Biomedical problems are innately complex, and their solutions require input from many fields. Many centers focus on a single disease or organ system. By contrast, the Center for Modeling Complex Interactions focuses on an approach that can address many biomedical problems: team-based, interdisciplinary research centered around modeling. Our goal is to support and facilitate biomedical discovery by integrating modeling into interdisciplinary research. Modeling improves research at all stages—hypothesis formulation, experimental design, analysis, and interpretation. It provides a unifying language by which exchange of ideas can highlight commonalities and uncover unforeseen connections between problems. Formalization of ideas into this unifying language also improves rigor and reproducibility. We define modeling broadly to include everything from deterministic and stochastic mathematical approaches, to physical and computational models of three- dimensional objects, to agent-based and machine learning approaches where exact solutions are not possible. We seek to support modelers by increasing their numbers, and by giving them opportunities to play on interdisciplinary teams. We seek to support empiricists by giving them access to relevant modeling expertise, and by creating a community and a culture to facilitate interdisciplinary research. In Phase I, the Center for Modeling Complex Interactions created the intellectual, cultural, and physical environment to promote team- based, interdisciplinary research. In Phase II, we will build on that foundation by maintaining a strong interdisciplinary culture to foster collaboration among people who might otherwise never connect, and by adding additional faculty to expand our modeling expertise. We have four Aims: 1) Support faculty to carry out model-based, interdisciplinary biomedical research and increase their competitiveness for external funding. Research in the Center is carried out in the context of Working Groups—zero-barrier, interdisciplinary, goal- focused teams that meet regularly to get work done. Supported research includes three Research Projects, Pilot Projects, Modeling Access Grants, and ad hoc teams. Our comprehensive plan for proposal preparation improves grantsmanship, and our staff assists with submission and grant management. 2) Increase University of Idaho’s faculty participation in biomedical research. We will add six new faculty as a commitment to this Phase II COBRE and attract broader participation from across the University. 3) Extend the reach of the Modeling Core into new areas of modeling to capitalize on emerging opportunities. The Modeling Core accelerates interdisciplinary research by placing Core Fellows at the hub of the research community. We have added new Core Initiatives in machine learning and geospatial modeling to stimulate research in these areas with high potential for future growth. 4) Establish a path to long-term sustainability under the umbrella of the Institute for Modeling Collaboration & Innovation. The major hurdle for sustainability is to maintain a robust Modeling Core. We have developed a business plan that calls for us to diversify our funding sources to include institutional, state, and private support to supplement federal grants. Human health is determined by interactions of complex biological systems at multiple scales, from the ecological to the biophysical; these are layered with spatial and temporal variation. To decipher these systems requires predictive modeling, coupled with strong empirical work, to be guided by and to feed the models.

"Integrating Machine Learning and Genomic Approaches to Understand Cerebral Small Vessel Disease Pathogenesis from White Matter Hyperintensity Patterns PROJECT SUMMARY  As a neurointensivist and neurologist at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (WUSM), my career goal is to develop an independent research program as a computational biologist capable of using advanced bioinformatics and statistical methods to integrate analysis of large-scale neuroimaging and genetic data, with the aim of deepening understanding of the biological mechanisms influencing cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) and identifying new targets for therapeutic development. As a first step towards this goal, I have designed an innovative proposal that combine machine-learning (ML) methods and integrated imaging genetic analyses of large-scale neuroimaging and genetic data to improve characterization of SVD disease mechanisms.  The clinical, imaging, and etiologic heterogeneity of SVD have impeded efforts to uncover the pathophysiology of this common and debilitating neurological disease. White matter hyperintensities (WMH), a major imaging endpoint of SVD, are comprised of multiple SVD pathologic processes. Growing evidence suggests location-specific vulnerability of brain parenchyma to different underlying SVD pathologic processes, in which spatially localized WMH patterns may reflect distinct SVD etiologies. Characterizing WMH spatial pattern variations in SVD will not only provide insights into underlying pathogenesis, such as vascular amyloid deposition, arteriolosclerosis, and other less well defined or as-yet unknown disease mechanisms, but also lead to creation of novel imaging biomarkers of these SVD pathologic processes. This proposal addresses a key inadequacy, as existing WMH pattern definitions are determined empirically and cannot distinguish overlapping SVD etiologies and risk factors. In this proposal, I aim to capture WMH spatial pattern variations that reflect distinct SVD etiologies in an unbiased manner, by applying clustering analysis/ML methods to structural MRI data to create novel etiology-specific SVD imaging phenotypes. Moreover, given that genetics influence the variance of WMH, I will integrate genetic analyses of these WMH patterns to uncover novel mechanisms that influence SVD pathogenesis. My preliminary data demonstrate the feasibility of identifying data-driven WMH spatial pattern variations, which are specific to distinct SVD etiologies, and allow detection of genetic risk variants that may help inform SVD pathologic processes.  My career plan leverages the extensive resources and exceptional environments at WUSM, under the guidance of a multidisciplinary mentorship team with expertise across diverse fields including cerebrovascular physiology, neuroimaging, informatics, genetics, and machine learning (Drs. Jin-Moo Lee, Daniel Marcus, Carlos Cruchaga and Yasheng Chen). In this Career Development Award, I propose to: 1) determine distinct WMH spatial patterns that can discriminate underlying SVD pathology and/or risk factors by applying pattern analysis ML methods to structural MRI data from three unique cohorts (n=2,710) enriched for different SVD pathologies (Aim 1a), and examining if the ML-defined WMH patterns segregate individuals by well-defined SVD risk factors as biologic validation (Aim 1b), and 2) identify genetic variants (Aim 2a) associated with WMH patterns that reflect diverse pathologic processes influencing SVD using genome wide association and gene-based analyses; replicate the top variants (Aim 2b) in an independent population-based cohort (n=21,708); and use advanced bioinformatics tools to uncover new biologic pathways associated with WMH spatial patterns (Aim 2c).  This research proposal and accompanying development plan with focused training in machine learning, neuroimaging, and multivariate methods for integrated imaging genetics analysis, will build on my background in genetics towards a career investigating cerebrovascular disorders using translational bioinformatics. This Award will provide me with the necessary training to evolve into an independent investigator with a computational research program that can integrate large imaging and genetics datasets to derive results that are highly relevant to the prevention and treatment of cerebrovascular disease in my clinical patient population. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is one of the most prevalent neurological conditions in older adults, and a leading cause of stroke and cognitive impairment, for which existing treatment and preventative options have been limited or lack efficacy. This project’s goal is to enhance our knowledge of the complex disease processes underlying SVD using machine learning and integrating individual imaging and genetic data from over 20,000 adults. By understanding these disease processes, we can design novel methods to more effectively treat and prevent stroke and dementia.",Integrating Machine Learning and Genomic Approaches to Understand

"Statistical Modeling of Multiparental and Genetic Reference Populations PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Genetic crosses in model organisms play an essential role in understanding how heritable factors affect medically relevant traits. Such crosses have traditionally tended to be on a small scale with limited power to detect genetic effects, limited ability to localize causal variants, and limited options for replication. In the last decade, however, the emergence of larger-scale interdisciplinary research, cheaper genotyping and parallel advances in human genetics, has spurred the development of more sophisticated and powerful experimental designs. Foremost are those that incorporate two modern genetic design concepts: the multiparental population (MPP), whereby each subject is descended from a small, well-characterized set of genetically diverse inbred strains, with the goal of efficiently exploring a wide genetic landscape; and the genetic reference population (GRP), whereby subjects are drawn from a large and genetically diverse set of inbred strains, with the goal that the study population, and thereby the studies themselves, can be infinitely replicated. Their combination, the multiparental genetic reference population (MP-GRP), represents the state-of-the-art in complex trait genetics and has been implemented in a number of model organisms, including plants, flies, and rodents.  The proposed program of research focuses on the development of statistical and computational tools to advance the design and analysis of studies using MPPs, GRPs and MP-GRPs. It centers around addressing three interconnected questions.  1) How to take advantage of biological replicates in a genetically varying population? Directions considered include: more stable methods to detect genetically-induced phenotypic outliers; use of genetically-induced heteroskedasticity to improve statistical power and find variance-controlling genes; and more rigorous and expansive characterization of gene-by-treatment effects by using principles from causal inference.  2) How to navigate the complex design space of MP-GRPs and their derived crosses? Directions considered include: use of decision theory applied to Bayesian analysis of pilot data; incorporation of variance heterogeneity to control likely reproducibility.  3) How to approach quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis in MPPs and MP-GRPs? Directions considered include: making haplotype-based association more robust to uncertainty in haplotype state; combining haplotype- based with variant-based mapping; adaptive modeling of QTL complexity; machine learning of the allelic series; familywise error rate control through descent-based permutation.  Progress on these fronts will not only fill significant gaps in studies using MPPs, GRPs and MP-GRPs, but will also provide tools and insights that will allow these designs to be used in new and more powerful ways. PROJECT NARRATIVE (RELEVANCE) The proposed research will lead to improvements in the analysis and design of genetic studies on experimental models of human disease.

"Advancing evolutionary genetic inference in humans and other taxa Project Summary/Abstract Background: A major challenge in evolutionary genomics is to characterize the forces shaping present-day patterns of genetic variation. For instance, the extent and manner in which natural selection affects genetic diversity remains highly controversial. Researchers have largely addressed this problem by developing statistical tests or summaries of genome sequence variation that provide insights into the evolutionary forces at play. However, because such approaches typically rely on a single univariate summary of the data, valuable discriminatory information present in the original dataset is lost. A more fruitful strategy would thus be to use multidimensional summaries of genomic data (e.g. a large vector of summary statistics) or even the totality of the input data (e.g. a matrix-representation of a sequence alignment) to make more accurate inferences. An even more powerful approach is to utilize data sets in which the same population is sampled at multiple time points, allowing one to observe evolutionary dynamics in action. Although such genomic time-series data are becoming more prevalent, the development of appropriate computational methodologies has lagged behind the proliferation of such data. Proposal: The Schrider Lab seeks to develop and apply powerful machine learning methods for evolutionary inference. Our work over the next five years will yield powerful software tools leveraging novel representations of genomic datasets, including time-series data. These efforts will dramatically improve researchers' ability to make accurate evolutionary inferences from both population genomic and phylogenetic data. Indeed, preliminary results demonstrate that our methods vastly outperform current approaches in evolutionary genetics. More importantly, we will use these tools to answer pressing evolutionary questions. In particular, our use of time-series data will reveal loci responsible for recent adaptation with much greater confidence than currently possible. Our efforts will help to resolve the controversy over the role of adaptation in shaping patterns of diversity across the human genome. This research has important implications for public health as well, as genes underlying recent adaptations are enriched for disease-associations. Moreover, we are constructing a time-series dataset in the mosquito vector species Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. We will interrogate these data for evidence of recent and ongoing adaptation—this work will reveal loci responsible for the evolution of resistance to insecticides and other control efforts. Encouraging preliminary data also suggest that our work in phylogenetics will substantially improve inferential power in this important research area. More broadly, the success of the novel approaches described in this proposal has the potential to transform the methodological landscape of evolutionary genomic data analysis. Project Narrative The work proposed here seeks to develop and apply powerful machine-learning based software tools for evolutionary genetic inference in humans, mosquito vectors, and other species. Such efforts have important health implications, as they can identify genes involved in adaptation, which in humans are often associated with disease and in mosquitos are often associated with resistance to insecticides and other control efforts.",Advancing evolutionary genetic inference in humans and other taxa,10028474,R35GM138286,"['Aedes ', ' Affect ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Evolution ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Insecticides ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Culicidae ', ' Mosquitoes ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Work ', ' Sequence Alignment ', ' sequencing alignment ', ' Natural Selections ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Series ', ' insight ', ' Genetic ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Pattern ', ' success ', ' novel ', ' Sampling ', ' Genomics ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Phylogenetics ', ' Phylogenetic Analysis ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' vector mosquito ', ' vector ', ' time use ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' Population ', ' resistant ', ' Resistance ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' genomic data ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R35,2020,382894,NC-04,-0.005116449879773902
"THE SEARCH FOR COVID-19 PREVENTION AND CURE: ADDRESSING THE CRITICAL ROLE OF INNATE/ADAPTIVE IMMUNITY BY INTEGRATING NOVEL INFORMATICS, TRANSLATIONAL TECHNOLOGIES, AND ONGOING CLINICAL TRIAL RESEARCH Individual CTSA hubs are leading the national clinical and translational research efforts in developing new approaches to address the COVID-19 pandemic. This crucial role was natural. Long before the current crisis, CTSA hubs were committed to translation, building multidisciplinary teams of investigators and community partners, overcoming regulatory burdens, ensuring quality in clinical and human research, developing transformative informatics, and disruptive technologies for diagnostics and therapeutics. In this proposal, we build on our center’s active participation in meaningful clinical trials (e.g., the NIH Remdesivir RCT), the early creation of a biospecimen repository from COVID-19 patients, institutional commitment and fundraising that led to a $3.5 million pilot fund distribution, a robust and accessible clinical database repository, and the ongoing work of an NCATS-supported CTSA Collaboration Innovation Award (a coalition of the J. Craig Venter Institute, UCSD, UCI, and Stanford) focused on artificial intelligence approaches for the analysis of flow cytometry data. Using the emerging informatics framework of supervised generalized canonical correlation for integrative data analysis, we will link clinical data from COVID-19 patients enrolled in a variety of trials and at various stages of disease with innovative in vitro evaluation of innate and adaptive immunity, an area still poorly understood in SARS-CoV-2 pathology, obtained from patient biospecimens to obtain mechanistic insights of COVID-19 pathogenesis at a systems level. Innate and adaptive immunity are particularly relevant to COVID-19 disease pathogenesis because they play key, but distinct, roles at all phases of the illness (initial tissue-virus interaction; systemic responses; the cell-mediated cytokine storm leading to multi- organ failure and death, likely long after levels of viremia have fallen; and, ultimately, protective immunity). The current CCIA novel flow cytometry informatics research permits elucidation of dynamic cellular immune responses related to the COVID-19 pandemic that were heretofore unobservable. Using Hi-DAFi for mass cytometry analysis, validated informatics pipelines for single cell transcriptomics analysis, and cutting-edge statistical data integration and machine learning strategies tied back to the available clinical data we will be able to discover novel associations between cellular biomarkers and disease state, a particular therapy, and disease mediating factors such as age, health disparities, and the presence of other diseases or conditions like obesity. This information will aid in critical efforts to target new therapies and possibly identify idiosyncratic individual physiologic variables that render certain patients who seem to have no known comorbidities more vulnerable to severe COVID-19 disease. Finally, the robust connection between the UCI hub and both regional and national networks (e.g., BRAID, the coalition of the 5 UC CTSAs, and NCATS Trial Innovation Network) will provide an unprecedented opportunity to rapidly disseminate clinically relevant discoveries and engage the talent and insight of the many clinicians and scientists working tirelessly to end this pandemic.

"Health, Neighborhood Context, and Mobility Neighborhood context may be an upstream cause of economic mobility, yet few neighborhood studies are experimental, weakening causal inference and limiting policy translation. Our study proposes to analyze newly- available data from a large, federal government initiated social experiment of voluntary neighborhood relocation using housing vouchers in 5 US cities (the Moving to Opportunity, MTO, Study). Our project will test whether, how, and among whom random assignment of an offer to move to a lower-poverty neighborhood influenced the economic mobility of 4600 low-income families over a 15 year period. The goal of MTO was to interrupt the cascading effects of neighborhood poverty for minority low-income families, by increasing area- based access to opportunities, and thereby promote economic mobility. Although the MTO voucher intervention did not consistently affect economic outcomes, it did profoundly affect health. Unfortunately, health researchers have had limited access to MTO data, compromising the scientific payoff of the $70+ million investment. So as of yet, we have no clear understanding of why results might differ across outcomes, groups, or what mechanisms are at play, since few studies have tested mediation or moderation. Since health is one of the most important barriers to economic self-sufficiency among low-income parents, it is conceivable that economic and employment gains were concentrated among families who first experienced health improvements. However testing whether factors that occurred after random assignment are precursors for other outcomes is methodologically challenging. Fortunately, recent methodological developments in the epidemiology discipline offer cogent solutions to model this complexity and bound any bias. We propose secondary data analyses with newly available 15 year follow-up data from this experiment, to test whether health influenced the economic effects of the randomized MTO housing voucher treatment. Paired with this experimental design, we propose to apply innovative causal methods and machine learning techniques for assessing mediation and effect modification, to overcome limitations and potential bias of traditional approaches, and strengthen causal inference. Our R01 project builds on a productive, interdisciplinary team, experienced with the MTO data, and draws on a barriers-to-employment framework. We propose 4 aims to determine: whether the effect of MTO on economic outcomes was modified by baseline health vulnerability; whether MTO improved parental economic outcomes, if they or their children experienced health gains; whether MTO improved children’s employment and education, if they experienced health gains; whether MTO improved economic outcomes, if families moved to neighborhoods with fewer spatial barriers to employment. Our findings have direct policy relevance since they address a key policy question in housing voucher implementation: incorporating elements from non-housing sectors (e.g., health, employment, education) to promote moves to higher opportunity neighborhoods, to ultimately improve outcomes for low income families. This project will test whether health-related barriers to employment mediate and moderate the effects of a social experiment of housing and neighborhood relocation on economic mobility, among adolescents, young adults, and their mothers. This knowledge will inform the next generation of social policy, e.g., to provide guidance on augmenting housing counseling assistance services to include health-related additional program supports and cross-sectoral services (e.g. health management or substance use treatment services) for vulnerable families.","Health, Neighborhood Context, and Mobility",9949737,R01HD090014,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Budgets ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Child Development ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Cities ', ' Counseling ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Economics ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Elements ', ' Employment ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Family ', ' Federal Government ', ' National Government ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Housing ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' indexing ', ' Investments ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mothers ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Parents ', ' Play ', ' Poverty ', ' Privatization ', ' Public Housing ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Wages ', ' Salaries ', ' Social Policies ', ' Testing ', ' Translations ', ' Weight ', ' Measures ', ' Data Compromising ', ' Mediating ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Adolescent ', ' Discipline ', ' AOD use ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' using substances ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' young adult ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' transdisciplinary collaboration ', ' interdisciplinary collaboration ', ' cohort ', ' Family Health ', ' Family health status ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' Negotiating ', ' Negotiation ', ' Mediation ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' voucher ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Low income ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Interruption ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Modification ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' next generation ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' treatment effect ', ' volunteer ', ' economic outcome ', ' treatment group ', ' improved outcome ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' lower income families ', ' welfare ', ' treatment services ', ' health care management ', ' healthcare management ', ' health management ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2020,483010,MN-05,-0.016401010235932014
"Role of State Medicaid Policies in Improving Access to Dental Care among Low-Income Adults PROJECT SUMMARY The purpose of this study is to examine how access to dental care among low-income adults is impacted by state Medicaid policies regarding eligibility, dental coverage, cost-sharing and dentist reimbursement. Oral health is integral to overall health, economic productivity and well-being. Yet access to dental care continues to be a major public health problem for low-income adults, leading to untreated disease, pain, poor systemic health and substantial economic burden. In recent years, several policy changes under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) such as Medicaid expansion and dependent care coverage could significantly impact access to dental care among the poor non-elderly adults. In addition, there is extensive cross-state variation in terms of dental benefits covered for Medicaid adults. These variations provide natural experiments to examine the effect of Medicaid policies on access to dental care. Moreover, under the current health reform discussions, state Medicaid programs are anticipated to gain autonomy in resource allocation, yet may receive significantly less federal funding, making the need for robust evidence on relative effectiveness of Medicaid policy alternatives available to the states paramount. The overarching goal of this application is to advance the research career of the candidate (Dr. Singhal) by protecting her time for training and research on these critical issues in oral health policy. This goal will be accomplished through additional training in complementary disciplines of econometrics and machine learning, and their application to estimate the impacts of Medicaid coverage and payment generosities on access to dental care. The project brings together complementary secondary data from multiple sources including: large national survey data (National Health Interview Survey), administrative enrollment and claims data (Medicaid Analytic eXtract) and linked survey and claims data. Leveraging these data and training resources, this project will: 1) develop synthetic indices of Medicaid dental coverage and payment generosities; 2) estimate the effect of each policy alternative and combined generosity indices on various measures of access to dental care; and 3) predict the relative effectiveness of policy alternatives and their combinations on access to dental care. We will use econometric methods including instrumental variables, difference-in-difference and regression discontinuity models to develop the generosity indices and to estimate the impact of Medicaid generosity. To develop and validate the predictive model, we will use supervised machine learning approaches (e.g. decision tree learning) using linked survey and claims data. The results will provide evidence needed to inform future strategies to ensure efficient use of health care resources to reduce oral health disparities. The completion of this project will also enable Dr. Singhal to establish a research program as an independent research investigator with support from her multi-disciplinary mentoring and advising teams and the vibrant research community at Boston University. PROJECT NARRATIVE Access to dental care is a major public health problem among low-income adults, as evidenced by declining rates of dental care utilization, high unmet dental need, and the increasing rate of emergency department visits for dental problems by this vulnerable population. The research plan of this career development award aims to: 1) examine how state Medicaid policies regarding eligibility, coverage and dentist reimbursement impact access to dental care among low-income adults, and 2) develop a model to predict the impact of hypothetical policy changes. A clearer understanding of the relative effectiveness of policy alternatives available to states is critical to ensuring the efficient use of healthcare resources and achieving NIDCR’s strategic goal to reduce income-based disparities in access to and outcomes of oral health care services.",Role of State Medicaid Policies in Improving Access to Dental Care among Low-Income Adults,9949693,K08DE027720,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Boston ', ' Communities ', ' Cost Control ', ' Cost Containment ', ' Dental Care ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' dental service ', ' Dental Health Services ', ' Dentists ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Economics ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Eligibility ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Environment ', ' Expenditure ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Policy ', ' health care policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' Health Services ', ' Health Services Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' services research ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' indexing ', ' Low Income Population ', ' Medicaid ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' pressure ', ' Production ', ' Productivity ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Policy ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Measures ', ' Cost Sharing ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Resource Allocation ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' career ', ' population survey ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' Health Reform ', ' Healthcare Reform ', ' Health Care Reform ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Dental ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Policies ', ' Development Plans ', ' Funding ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Structure ', ' payment ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Economic Burden ', ' Improve Access ', ' National Health Interview Survey ', ' NIDCR ', ' NIDR ', ' National Institute of Dental Research ', ' National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' K-Awards ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' cost ', ' health economics ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Natural experiment ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' evidence base ', ' population health ', ' BigData ', ' Big Data ', ' ED visit ', ' ER visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' Emergency hospital visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' Obamacare ', ' Affordable Care Act ', ' healthcare service ', ' health care service ', ' relative effectiveness ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' supervised learning ', ' decision tree learning ', ' econometrics ', ' multiple data sources ', ' ']",NIDCR,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,K08,2020,131517,MA-07,0.002198622639929274
"Omics data integration and analysis for structure-based multi-target drug design Abstract Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS), whole genome sequencing, and high-throughput techniques have generated vast amounts of diverse omics and phenotypic data. However, these sets of data have not yet been fully explored to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of drug discovery, which continues along the one- drug-one-gene paradigm. Consequently, the cost of bringing a drug to market is staggering, and the failure rate is daunting. Our long-term goal is to revive the lagging pharmaceutical pipeline by identifying robust methods for achieving precision medicine. We will achieve this goal by developing a novel structural systems pharmacology approach to drug discovery, which integrates structure-based drug design with heterogeneous omics data integration and analysis in the context of the whole human and pathogen genome and interactome. An increasing body of evidence from both our group and others suggests that most drugs commonly interact with multiple receptors (targets). Both strong and weak multiple drug-target interactions can collectively mediate drug efficacy, toxicity, and resistance through the conformational dynamics of biomolecules. In order to rationally design potent, safe, and precision medicine, we face one of the major unsolved challenges in structure-based drug design: what are all the possible proteins and their conformational states interacting with a drug in an organism? This proposal attempts to address this challenge by developing, disseminating, and experimentally testing novel computational tools. Based on our successful preliminary results, we will develop an integrated computational pipeline to identify three-dimensional (3D) protein-chemical interaction models in the cellular context and on a structural proteome scale. Specifically, we will develop a quaternary structure- centric multi-layered network model by integrating heterogeneous data from genomics, proteomics, and phenomics. We will develop a novel collaborative one-class collaborative filtering algorithm to infer missing relations in the multi-layered network. We will combine tools derived from structural bioinformatics, biophysics, and machine learning to gain biological insights into the drug action. To facilitate the usability and reproducibility of the proposed algorithms, we will develop community-based web resources established by our previous experiences in developing the Protein Data Bank (PDB). More importantly, we will work closely with experimental laboratories to test the proposed computational tools using targeted kinase polypharmacology as a real-world example, and iteratively improve the performance and usability of algorithm, software, and web services. The successful completion of this project will provide the scientific community with: (1) new methods to enhance the scope and capability of high-throughput screening for structure-based multi-target drug design; (2) a user-friendly web service to support community-based drug discovery; and (3) potential novel anti-cancer targeted therapeutics. Together, these tools will advance drug discovery and precision medicine by providing a structural systems pharmacology toolkit. Relevance Statement The pharmaceutical industry is in a dire state. Both the cost to launch a new drug and the attrition rate are increasing. Methods that can correlate drug-target interactions with clinical outcomes will reduce both the cost of drug development and mortality rates during clinical trials and treatments.",Omics data

"Computational Methods for Next-Generation Comparative Genomics PROJECT SUMMARY Recent advances in regulatory genomics, especially 3D genome organization in cell nucleus, suggest that existing methods for cross-species comparisons are limited in their ability to fully understand the evolution of non-coding genome function. In particular, it is known that genomes are compartmentalized to distinct compartments in the nucleus such as nuclear lamina and nuclear speckles. Such nuclear compartmentalization is an essential feature of higher-order genome organization and is linked to various important genome functions such as DNA replication timing and transcription. Unfortunately, to date no study exists that directly compares nuclear compartmentalization between human and other mammals. In addition, there are no computational models available that consider the continuous nature of multiple features of nuclear compartmentalization and function, which is critical to integrate genome-wide functional genomic data and datasets that measure cytological distance to multiple compartments across species. In this project, we will develop novel algorithms and generate new datasets to directly address two key questions: (1) How to identify the evolutionary patterns of nuclear compartmentalization? (2) What types of sequence evolution may drive spatial localization changes across species? The proposed project represents the first endeavor in comparative genomics for nuclear compartmentalization. Our Specific Aims are: (1) Developing new probabilistic models for identifying evolutionary patterns of nuclear compartmentalization. (2) Identifying genome-wide evolutionary patterns of nuclear compartmentalization in primate species based on TSA-seq and Repli-seq. (3) Developing new algorithms to connect sequence features to nuclear compartmentalization through cross-species comparisons. Successful completion of these aims will result in novel computational tools and new datasets that will be highly valuable for the comparative genomics community. Integrating the new computational tools and unique datasets will provide invaluable insights into the relationship between sequence evolution and changes in nuclear genome organization in mammalian species. Therefore, the proposed research is expected to advance comparative genomics to a new frontier and provide new perspectives for studying human genome function PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because the outcome of the project is expected to enhance the analyses of nuclear genome organizations across primate species to better understand genome function and human biology.

"A BRAIN Initiative Resource: The Neuroscience Multi-omic Data Archive Project Summary The Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative promotes the development and application of technologies to describe the temporal and spatial dynamics of cell types and neural circuits in the brain. The Principal Investigator, senior personnel and staff of this project have diverse expertise required to marshall data across the BRAIN Initiative consortium, including experience in data collection from multiple institutions, large-scale quality control and analysis processing capability, familiarity with NIH policy and public archive deposition strategies. To promote smooth interactions across a large research consortium, we will develop the Neuroscience Multi-Omic Archive (NeMO Archive), a data repository that is specifically focused on the storage and dissemination of omic data from the BRAIN Initiative and related brain research projects. We will utilize a federated model for data storage such that the physical location of data can be distributed between the NeMO local file system, public repositories, and a cloud-based storage system (e.g. Amazon S3). We will leverage this capability and distribute BRAIN Initiative data between our local filesystem and the cloud. The Nemo Archive will be a data resource consistent with the principles advanced by research community members who are launching resources in next generation NIH data ecosystem. These practices include FAIR Principles, documentation of APIs, data-indexing systems, workflow sharing, use of shareable software pipelines and storage on cloud-based systems.

"Dissecting the pathogenesis and outcomes of PSC using multi-omics by studying the exposome and genome PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The major goal of this RC2 proposal is to generate the first, multi-omics translational study capturing the sum of environmental exposures (i.e. the exposome) and comprehensive data resource for Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC), a chronic, progressive liver disease without effective medical therapy. PSC shortens survival, is associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and strongly predisposes to cholangiocarcinoma (i.e. bile duct cancer) and colon cancer. Our recent genome wide association studies (GWAS) revealed the significant role of genetic variation in PSC, while also re-emphasizing the importance of environmental factors and gene-environment interactions in PSC pathogenesis. To further elucidate the role of exposures from our external environment and lifestyle (e.g., diet, stress, toxins, drugs, microbes), we have assembled a world-class, multi-disciplinary team that synergizes expertise and resources across four institutions: Mayo Clinic, Emory University, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), and University of Oslo, Norway. Our collaborative team will leverage large clinical databases and biorepositories, as well as expertise in PSC and related conditions, exposomics, metabolomics, methylomics, transcriptomics, metagenomics, genomics, and data analytics to develop the PSC Scientific Community Resource for hypothesis-generating science and simultaneously uncover factors contributing to PSC.  We now seek to define the bigger-picture cellular networks, rather than individual genes, driving disease processes. To do so, we will use unbiased network-based approaches designed to integrate multiple layers of omics data. Our proposal is predicated on the hypothesis that multi-omics analyses of data capturing environmental exposures and the associated biological responses, including the effect on the genome, will reveal networks or pathways influencing PSC pathogenesis and outcomes. To test this hypothesis, we will perform a series of sophisticated analyses to identify PSC-associated changes in and across the exposome, metabolome, methylome, and transcriptome in blood as well as the gut metagenome, exposome and metabolome.  Our collaboration and data generation are already underway with pilot studies demonstrating differences in blood exposomes and metabolomes and stool metagenomes between PSC patients and controls. Using a suite of bioinformatic tools and available genetic variation data, we aim to discover stable, detectable, omics-based disease signatures in blood (Aim 1) and stool (Aim 2) that when integrated with clinical data (Aim 3) will reveal biological pathways driving disease pathogenesis and outcomes. All data, residual specimens, and analytical details will be made freely available to the research community in accordance with NIDDK's mission. Furthermore, this effort responds to the NIDDK's call “to better understand the role of the microbiome, genetics, and exposome.” PROJECT NARRATIVE We seek to generate the first, multi-omics translational study and comprehensive data resource for Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC), a chronic, progressive liver disease without medical therapy.

"Accelerating the Diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder Using Genetic and Phenotypic Signatures PROJECT SUMMARY The diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder (BPD), a heritable disorder characterized by periods of depression and mania, is extremely challenging in clinical practice and takes on average 5-10 years. One of the main reasons for this delay is that the majority of patients first manifest depressive symptoms (depression-first BPD), often resulting in misdiagnosis with major depressive disorder (MDD). Misdiagnosis can lead to poor clinical outcomes, increased burden for patients and high healthcare costs. The goal of this proposal is to identify genetic and phenotypic signatures that distinguish depression-first BPD from MDD, in order to accelerate BPD diagnosis. During the mentored phase (K99) of the award, the PI will perform a genome wide association study to characterize the genetic architecture of differences between depression-first BPD and MDD, using available data from the collaborative Psychiatrics Genetics Consortium (Aim 1a). In a Dutch BPD cohort (n=1,750 cases) she will use machine learning methods to identify molecular, neuro-cognitive and behavioral profiles to classify depression-first BPD versus mania-first BPD (BPD with first onset of mania) and identify causal relations among predictive features (Aim 1b). During the independent phase (R00) of the award, the PI will study BPD diagnosis in a genotyped and extensively phenotyped Colombian cohort of ~5,000 cases with severe mood disorders, for which high quality electronic health records (EHR) have been collected since 2005. She will i) predict if and when patients will switch from MDD to BPD diagnosis, ii) distinguish BPD from matched MDD patients, and iii) classify BPD patients into depression-first and mania-first categories (Aims 2 and 3). She will estimate heritability of identified signatures and integrate results from both Dutch and Colombian cohorts. Building upon her expertise in complex trait genetics and method development, this award will allow the PI to extend her knowledge-base of clinical phenotyping in psychiatry; grow her expertise in statistical modeling; and strengthen her communication, mentoring, and leadership skills to prepare for a successful career as an independent researcher. The PI will complete the K99 phase of the award at UCLA, which fosters an ideal training environment. The strong advisory committee with Drs. Freimer, Ophoff, and Eskin (UCLA) and Dr. Sabatti (Stanford) will facilitate her scientific and personal development and promote her long-term career goal of tackling clinically relevant problems in psychiatric illness through the study of genetic, neuro-cognitive and behavioral mechanisms. The PI will first focus on the diagnosis of BPD, and then expand, in the future, into other psychiatric trait-mechanisms, such as disease severity and drug response. This award will be fundamental in support of her career goals. Successful completion of the specific aims of this proposal is likely to significantly improve the time to BPD diagnosis, and thereby reduce the burden of this debilitating disorder for patients and society. ! PROJECT NARRATIVE Because the majority of patients with bipolar disorder initially manifest depressive symptoms and are misdiagnosed with major depressive disorder, they often receive several years of sub-optimal treatment and experience poor clinical outcomes, until they obtain the correct diagnosis.

"Mechanoresponsive Engrailed-1-negative fibroblasts activate Engrailed-1 to promote fibrosis in wound healing 7. Project Summary/Abstract Adult human skin heals by developing fibrotic scar tissue, which can result in devastating disfigurement, growth restriction, and permanent functional loss. Despite a plethora of clinical options, no current treatment strategies successfully prevent or reverse this fibrotic process, and scars and their sequelae cost the United States over $20 billion every year. Progress towards the development of new therapies has been significantly hindered by a lack of understanding of the specific cell populations responsible for scarring. In 2015, our group reported that Engrailed-1 (En-1) lineage-positive fibroblasts (EPFs) are responsible for the vast majority of dorsal scar production in postnatal mice. In early fetal gestation, mice heal scarlessly via skin regeneration, an ideal outcome mediated by En-1 lineage-negative fibroblasts (ENFs; the predominant fetal fibroblast). However, it has not been established if ENFs contribute to postnatal wound healing. In this proposal, we explore for the first time the postnatal conversion of ENFs to pro-fibrotic EPFs (postnatally-derived EPFs; pEPFs) within the wound environment. First, histology, immunohistochemistry, and wounding in a novel transgenic mouse model will be used to study the conversion of ENFs to pEPFs during wound healing. By examining the behavior of ENF subpopulations (derived from papillary dermis, reticular dermis, and hypodermis) in the wound environment and confirming our findings in a tamoxifen-inducible mouse model of En-1 activation, we will precisely define the ENF population that gives rise to pro-fibrotic pEPFs. Second, we will establish the specific wound environment cues that drive ENF-to-EPF transition. Given that mechanical forces are known to modulate both scar burden and fibroblast activity, we will use in vitro and in vivo models to examine the effects of mechanical environment on En-1 activation. We will further use transcriptomic and epigenomic profiling to explore the role of mechanotransduction signaling in ENF-to-EPF transition and pEPF function. Third, having established a mechanotransduction mechanism underlying En-1 activation in wound ENFs, we will inhibit mechanotransduction signaling with the goal of blocking ENF-to-EPF transition. Specifically, we will assess whether blocking mechanotransduction results in ENF-mediated wound healing with reduced fibrosis. Our ultimate translational goal is to develop therapeutics that target fibrogenic fibroblasts to promote regenerative healing. Collectively, the proposed work will significantly enhance our understanding of the key molecular and cellular determinants of cutaneous scarring, inform the development of novel anti-scarring therapies, and shed light on the cellular origin of dermal scarring fibroblasts. 8. Project Narrative Scarring is the end result of injury in adult human skin and results in an enormous financial and medical burden for our society. There are currently no effective molecular therapies that prevent scarring or its sequelae, and development of therapeutics has been hindered by lack of understanding of the precise cell populations that mediate fibrosis in wound healing. Therefore, we propose to explore the contribution of a specific fibroblast subpopulation (Engrailed-1 lineage-negative fibroblasts; ENFs) in fibrotic wound healing, in order to inform novel directions for targeted treatments that minimize scarring and promote regenerative wound healing.",Mechanoresponsive Engrailed-1-negative fibroblasts activate Engrailed-1 to promote fibrosis in wound healing,9933446,R01GM136659,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Algorithms ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Behavior ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cultured Cells ', ' Chromatin ', ' Cicatrix ', ' Scars ', ' Collagen ', ' Connective Tissue ', ' Cues ', ' Dermis ', ' Corium ', ' Cutis ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Extracellular Matrix ', ' Cell-Extracellular Matrix ', ' ECM ', ' Fibroblasts ', ' Fibrosis ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Histology ', ' Immunohistochemistry ', ' Immunohistochemistry Cell/Tissue ', ' Immunohistochemistry Staining Method ', ' In Vitro ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Maps ', ' Transgenic Mice ', ' Microscopy ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Production ', ' Proteins ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Societies ', ' Mechanical Stress ', ' Tamoxifen ', ' Time ', ' tissue culture ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' wound healing ', ' Wound Repair ', ' wound resolution ', ' Focal Adhesion Kinase 1 ', ' PTK2 Protein Tyrosine Kinase 2 ', ' endogenous substrate pp120 ', ' focal adhesion kinase ', ' focal adhesion protein tyrosine kinase ', ' focal adhesion-associated protein tyrosine kinase pp125FAK ', ' Transposase ', ' Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting ', ' Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting Fractionation ', ' Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sortings ', ' Measures ', ' Dipeptidyl-Peptidase IV ', ' Adenosine Deaminase-Binding Proteins ', ' CD26 ', ' CD26 Antigens ', ' Mediating ', ' injuries ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' Dorsal ', ' Site ', ' Surface ', ' Clinical ', ' Papillary ', ' Histologically ', ' Histologic ', ' Medical ', ' Chemicals ', ' Cutaneous ', ' Dermal ', ' Hair Follicle ', ' Hair follicle structure ', ' Fiber ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' analog ', ' Hypodermis ', ' Subcutis ', ' Superficial Fascia ', ' Tela Subcutanea ', ' Subcutaneous Tissue ', ' Engraftment ', ' tool ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' BPD verteporfin ', ' BPD-MA ', ' Benzoporphyrin Derivative Monoacid Ring A ', ' Visudyne ', ' benzoporphyrin D ', ' verteporphin ', ' Verteporfin ', ' postnatal ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' fetal ', ' Hydrogels ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' response ', ' Skin ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' Protein Inhibition ', ' in vivo ', ' in vivo Model ', ' Anatomic Surface ', ' cell assay ', ' Cellular Assay ', ' wildtype mouse ', ' Wild Type Mouse ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' epigenomics ', ' cost ', ' healing ', ' reconstruction ', ' digital ', ' Outcome ', ' tissue wound ', ' wounding ', ' wounds ', ' wound ', ' Population ', ' transcriptomics ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' murine model ', ' mouse model ', ' therapeutic target ', ' functional loss ', ' therapeutic agent development ', ' therapeutic development ', ' treatment strategy ', ' regenerative ', ' regenerate skin ', ' skin healing ', ' skin regeneration ', ' High-Throughput Sequencing ', ' High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing ', ' mechanosensing ', ' mechanotransduction ', ' mechanical force ', ' cutaneous wound ', ' dermal wound ', ' skin wound ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' scRNA-seq ', ' single cell RNA-seq ', ' single cell RNAseq ', ' single-cell RNA sequencing ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' wound environment ', ' wound bed ', ' ']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,317823,CA-18,0.0017915203998837212
"Carolina Population Center PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The Carolina Population Center requests infrastructure support that will advance population dynamics research at CPC by increasing research impact, innovation, and productivity, supporting the development of junior scientists, and reducing the administrative burden on scientists. Infrastructure support will advance science in three primary research areas: Sexuality, Reproduction, Fertility, and Families; Population, Health, and the Environment; and Inequality, Mobility, Disparities, and Well-Being. Much of the research at CPC draws on large publicly available longitudinal data sets that our faculty have designed and collected, including the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, the China Health and Nutrition Survey, newer surveys associated with the Transfer Project, and the Study of the Tsunami Aftermath and Recovery, all of which will continue to be important in work related to our primary research areas over the next five years. These projects embody several themes that have guided research at CPC since the Center's inception. These themes, which will continue to shape our work, are the importance of life course processes and longitudinal data, multi-level processes and measurement of context, interventions and natural experiments as means of learning about causal processes, and the relevance of sociodemographic variables such as age, gender, race- ethnicity, and socioeconomic status for disparities in health and well-being. By embedding these themes, our projects provide data that enable us to address barriers that otherwise impede progress in the population sciences generally, and in our primary research areas in particular. We request support for three cores which in combination will provide an institutional infrastructure that will push populations dynamics research forward by empowering CPC faculty to tackle challenging questions using state of the art measurement techniques and methods. The Administrative Core plans activities that maintain a stimulating intellectual community, streamlines administrative processes so that scientists can focus on research, coordinates activities of the Cores so that services are offered efficiently, and communicates information about research and data more broadly. The Development Core supports early stage investigators and other faculty with exciting new ideas through multiple mechanisms: workshops, access to technical expertise in measurement, and seed grants. The Research Services Core enables scientists to address complex and important population research issues by providing access to state-of-the-art research tools and professional support for programming, survey development, and analysis.

This mission is met by leveraging our outstanding institutional resources and support, partnering with disability communities, and capitalizing on synergistic interactions across the VKC’s federally-designated centers: the VKC IDDRC, a University Center of Excellence in Developmental Disabilities and a Leadership Education in Neurodevelopmental Disabilities program. The IDDRC as the centerpiece of the VKC is the foundational organizing structure that creates a “Center culture” wherein research and discovery permeates the VKC’s broader training and service activities, thus enhancing the translational research goals of the IDDRC. Demonstrable IDDRC success includes 976 investigator- authored publications and robust NIH funding to Vanderbilt to support IDD-related research ($52.6M in FY20). Harnessing and leveraging this trans-institutional strength to focus on unique challenges in IDD, the overarching goal of the next phase of the IDDRC is to develop precision care for IDD by providing infrastructure and scientific leadership to enable rapid translation of basic discoveries into high- impact IDD interventions and treatments. Three global Aims guide the IDDRC’s work. Aim 1 provides core services to enable and disseminate impactful research on individualizing treatments based upon the causes, mechanisms, and contributing co-morbid sequelae of IDD; Aim 2 focuses on incorporating innovative methods and approaches to enhance multidisciplinary IDD research; and Aim 3 proposes to conduct a signature research project to improve the precision use of antipsychotic medication in people with autism. Across these Aims and five Cores supported by the IDDRC (Administrative, Clinical Translational, Translational Neuroscience, Behavioral Phenotyping, and Data Sciences), three themes permeate our work: (1) recruitment of highly-skilled researchers not currently conducting IDD research (non-traditional researchers); (2) inclusion of IDD participants into research studies that currently do not include IDD (non-traditional subjects); and (3) incorporation of novel scientific approaches and methods (non-traditional approaches). Our IDDRC is ideally posed to enable rapid discovery of precision care approaches by supporting 50 investigators leading 70 research projects (15 from NICHD) and, as highlighted by the Signature Research Project, to promote and implement generative, novel, and impactful research directions, thus meeting the NICHD’s vision of applying newly evolved technologies and approaches to rapidly accelerate the prevention and/or amelioration of IDDs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: As a group, intellectual and developmental disabilities, including Down syndrome and autism spectrum disorder, have dramatic effects on affected people’s and their caregiver’s lives. Unfortunately, there remains a lack of understanding about what causes these disabilities and, critically, how to treat them with targeted therapies. The Vanderbilt Kennedy Center’s Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center serves as the hub for Vanderbilt’s research efforts focusing on improving the lives of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities by understanding the causes of these disorders and developing and testing therapies tailored to each individual’s precise needs.",Overall: Eunice Kennedy

"Discovery and validation of neuronal enhancers as development of psychiatric disorders supplement Project Summary/Abstract The mandate of the PsychENCODE Data Analysis Core (DAC) includes the development of novel integrative methodologies to construct a coherent interpretational framework for the data emerging from the consortium. The complexity of building such a framework lies in the diversity of experimental assays and their associated confounding factors, as well as in the inherent uncertainty regarding how the various target biological components function together. As a result, any analytical and computational methods would need to capture this high dimensionality of structure in the data. While classical, parallel computation advances at an incredible pace and continues to serve the needs of the research community, our experience with the ever- increasing complexity of neuropsychiatric datasets has motivated us to also look at other promising technological avenues. Accordingly, motivated by recent developments in the field of quantum computing (QC), we herein explore the use of QC algorithms as applied to two problems of relevance to the PsychENCODE DAC: (1) the prediction of brain-specific enhancers based on variants and functional genomic assays (Aim S1; related to Aim 1 of the parent grant); and (2) the calculation of the contributions of cell types to tissue-level gene expression and to the occurrence of psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder and bipolar disorder (Aim S2; related to Aim 1 of the parent grant). The nascency of QC hardware technologies and the complexity of simulating quantum algorithms on classical computing resources means that our exploration will be confined to smaller, judiciously chosen datasets.Nevertheless, the work in this supplement will serve to evaluate future prospects for the use of QC algorithms and hardware in genomic analyses. We also consider two different paradigms of QC, the quantum annealer and the quantum gate model, and weigh their efficiency relative to classical computing. Finally, we will incorporate the QC and classical predictions into PsychENCODE consortium's database and online portal for visualizing the relationships between different genetic and genomic elements, and evaluate corroborating evidence for the predictions (Aim S3; related to Aim 2 of the parent grant). Project Narrative The PsychENCODE consortium has conducted extensive functional genomic analyses of samples from individuals diagnosed with psychiatric disorders aim to discover the complex biological architecture that lead from genetic and epigenetic markers of disease to the observed phenotypes. To reveal this underlying structure, the consortium relies on the use of sophisticated computational methods, including machine learning techniques, implemented on cutting-edge massively parallel computing resources by the consrtium’s Data Analysis Core (DAC). However, the scale and complexity of the tasks place significant burdens on these resources, and suggest the need for exploring alternative computing hardware technologies. This supplement to the DAC parent grant evaluates the promise of the emerging field of quantum computing to speed up large-scale computations and more efficiently explore the model landscape, using a comparative analysis of classical and quantum computing algorithms applied to problems relevant to the PsychENCODE DAC: the annotation of brain-specific enhancers and the quantification of cell-type contributions to bulk tissue gene expression.",Discovery and validation of neuronal enhancers as development of psychiatric disorders supplement,10047746,U01MH116492,"['Algorithms ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communities ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genetic Markers ', ' genetic biomarker ', ' Goals ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Least-Squares Analysis ', ' Least Squares ', ' Least-Squares Analyses ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Phenotype ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Running ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Technology ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Toy ', ' Work ', ' Enhancers ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Genetic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' cell type ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' neuropsychiatric ', ' neuropsychiatry ', ' functional genomics ', ' Genomics ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' Disease Marker ', ' Validation ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Output ', ' epigenomics ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' quantum ', ' computational resources ', ' computing resources ', ' parallel computation ', ' parallel computing ', ' parallel computer ', ' comparative ', ' prototype ', ' parent grant ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' epigenetic biomarker ', ' epigenetic marker ', ' quantum coding ', ' quantum computation ', ' quantum error correcting codes ', ' quantum computing ', ' internet portal ', ' on-line portal ', ' online portal ', ' web-based portal ', ' web portal ', ' high dimensionality ', ' eMERGE Consortium ', ' eMERGE Network ', ' Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network ', ' Visualization ', ' data framework ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,U01,2020,195697,MA-02,-0.012250792642201852
"Nathan Shock Center of Excellence in Basic Biology of Aging OVERALL PROJECT SUMMARY This application is for renewal of the Nathan Shock Center of Excellence in the Basic Biology of Aging at the University of Washington and affiliated institutions. This Center has over the past 25 years provided key resources in support of investigators who study the biology of aging. This application continues a theme that emphasizes outreach and service to the broadest community of investigators in the gerosciences. Of proximal relevance is the characterization of aging-related phenotypes of longevity and healthspan. As our Center services must be easily accessible to outside users, our Longevity and Healthspan Core (Core E) focuses on invertebrate assays, many of them novel. Two other Resources Cores focus on the high dimensional assessments that are closely related to aging phenotypes: Protein Phenotypes of Aging (Core C) and Metabolite Phenotypes of Aging (Core D). Sophisticated computational and bioinformatic tools for data analysis and optimal insight are provided by the Artificial Intelligence and Bioinformatics Core F. Each of these four Resource Cores is led by highly respected experts in that field, including Michael MacCoss and Judit Villen (Core C), Daniel Promislow (Core D), Matt Kaeberlein and Maitreya Dunham (Core E) and Su-In Lee (Core F). Each will push the envelope of appropriate technologies, developing new state-of-the art approaches for assessments that are the most applicable to gerontology and making them accessible to the national aging community. The Research Development Core (Core B) will continue to support pilot and junior faculty studies, with a firm focus on outreach of service to the national geroscience constituency. The Administrative and Program Enrichment Core (Core A) supports administrative management, an external advisory panel, courses, and data sharing and dissemination. Core A’s program of seminars and symposia will continue a focus on sponsorship and organization of national courses, meetings and pre-meetings, as well as workshops in the fields allied to our Resource Core Services.

"Real-time Non-Rigid 3D Reconstruction and Registration for Laparoscopic-guided Minimally Invasive Liver Surgery Project Summary/Abstract Liver deformation leads to difficulties in tumor localization during minimally invasive liver surgery (MILS). The goal of this proposal is to develop an efficient surgical navigation tool for MILS by compensating for liver deformation and mapping preoperative data to the patient’s anatomy. Specifically, we will develop a non-rigid simultaneously localization and mapping (SLAM) approach to estimate the deformation of liver surface from stereo laparoscopy videos. We will develop machine-learning methods to detect landmarks and perform non- rigid registration. The algorithms will be implemented on a GPU to achieve real-time. Preliminary data has demonstrated the feasibility. During the R00 phase, we will mainly address the clinical needs and develop novel ways to provide intraoperative guidance. This project will greatly improve the tumor resection accuracy in MILS. The candidate for this award Dr. Haoyin Zhou is a postdoc at Surgical Planning Laboratory (SPL), Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH) and Harvard Medical School (HMS). Dr. Zhou has extensive experience and expertise in computer vision, machine learning and their applications in medicine. BWH is an international leader in basic, clinical and translational research on human diseases, and has established multiple research programs to promote the work and professional career development of young investigators.

"New Jersey Alliance for Clinical Translational Science: NJ ACTS Contact PD/PI: Panettieri, Reynold Alexander Project Summary/Abstract Overview Coordinated by Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences (RBHS), the New Jersey Alliance for Clinical and Translational Science (NJ ACTS) comprises a consortium with Rutgers and Princeton Universities (PU), NJ Institute for Technology (NJIT), medical, nursing, dental and public health schools, hospitals, community health centers, outpatient practices, industry, policymakers and health information exchanges. All Alliance universities and affiliates have provided substantial resources and contributed to the planning, development and leadership of the consortium. With access to ~7 million people, NJ ACTS serves as a ‘natural laboratory’ for translational and clinical research. With a state population of ~9 million, New Jersey ranks 11th in the US, 1st in population density and higher than average in racial and ethnic diversity. Surprisingly, NJ has no CTSA Hub to coordinate translational and clinical research. Our CTSA Hub focuses on two overarching themes: the heterogeneity of disease pathogenesis and response to treatment, and the value of linking large clinical databases with interventional clinical investigations to identify cause-and-effect and predict therapeutic responses. NJ ACTS will provide: innovative approaches to link information from large databases and electronic health records to inform clinical trial design, execution and analysis; and novel platforms for biomarker discovery using fluorescence in situ hybridization and machine learning to identify unique neural signatures of chronic illness. NJ ACTS will access a large health system with significant member diversity; a rich legacy of community engagement and community-based research platforms; and proven approaches to enhance workforce development in clinical research. With a substantial investment in streamlining research administration and IRB practices at Rutgers and with the inception of NJ ACTS, there exists an unparalleled opportunity for logarithmic growth in clinical research in New Jersey. To build our capacity for participant and clinical interactions as a CTSA Hub, the newly established Trial Accelerator and Recruitment Office will coordinate feasibility assessment, implementation, recruitment, and evaluation of clinical studies. Additionally, our organization of five clinical research units into a cohesive network provides extraordinary expertise in strategic locations to enhance participant recruitment from diverse communities with a particular focus on: children; the elderly; those with serious mental illness or substance abuse issues; low-income individuals served by Medicaid; those with HIV/AIDS; and people of all ages who are minorities, underserved, and victims of health and environmental disparities. With a history of collaboration, partners and affiliates share unique skills, expertise, training and mentoring capabilities that will be greatly amplified within the infrastructure of a CTSA Hub. Princeton and NJIT, without medical schools or hospital affiliates, seeks collaboration with Rutgers to provide clinical research platforms; Rutgers seeks the PU and NJIT expertise in novel informatics platforms, expertise in natural language and ontology, machine learning and cognitive neurosciences. Together NJ ACTS will provide an alliance that will catalyze clinical research and training across New Jersey to improve population health and contribute to the CTSA Consortium. In this revised application, the overall themes remain unchanged but Cores leadership and direction has been markedly refined.

"Measuring, Modeling and Controlling Heterogeneity ABSTRACT - Overall The overall goal of the Measuring, Modeling and Controlling Heterogeneity Center in the Cancer Systems Biol- ogy Consortium (M2CH-CSBC Center) is to improve management of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) by developing systems level strategies to prevent the emergence of cancer subpopulations that are resistant to treatment. We postulate that heterogeneity arising from epigenomic instability intrinsic to cancer cells and di- verse signals from extrinsic microenvironments in which cancer cells reside are root causes of resistance. We will learn how intrinsic and extrinsic factors influence differentiation state, proliferation and therapeutic re- sponse in TNBC through experimental manipulation and computational modeling of cancer cell lines, 3D engi- neered multicellular systems, xenografts and clinical specimens. We will deploy single cell `omic and imaging technologies that allow quantitative assessment of molecular, cellular, and structural heterogeneity. We will interpret these data using computational models that define control networks and structures in heterogeneous systems as well as transitions between states of therapeutic resistance and sensitivity. This will be accom- plished in three related Projects and three Cores. Project 1 will focus on measuring and managing resistance- associated heterogeneity intrinsic to cancer cells. Project 2 will focus on identifying resistance-associated sig- nals from the microenvironment and on mitigating effects from these signals on therapeutic response. Project 3 will apply spatial systems biology approaches to TNBC specimens and multicell type models thereof to dis- cover molecular control networks that influence how cell intrinsic plasticity and microenvironment signaling al- ter therapeutic responses in complex tissues. All three Projects will include analysis of 5 core cell lines (HCC1143, HCC1599, MDA-MB-468, SUM149PT, and HCC1806), 5 patient derived cultures, and 6 FDA ap- proved, pathway-targeted drugs (afatinib, ruxolotinib, trametinib, BYL719, cabozantinib, and everolimus). The computational network discovery, data integration, spatial systems analysis and modeling approaches are the same in all Projects and serve to integrate the work of the overall M2CH-CSBC Center. Multiple integrative computational strategies are proposed to identify candidate heterogeneity control networks. These include analysis of existing genomic, epigenomic, pharmacologic response, and metabolomic characteristics of prima- ry tumors and models thereof. An Imaging Management and Analysis Core will provide infrastructure and image analytics that will enable efficient image data management, quantitative analysis of image features, and visualization of images and metadata generated using multiscale light and electron microscopy. An Outreach Core will make educational materials, experimental and computational tools and data available to the CSB Consortium, to the CSBC/PS-ON Coordinating Center and to the broader scientific community. An Administrative Core serves as the organization, integration, and evaluation hub of the M2CH-CSBC Center. Project narrative This Project will improve management of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) by understanding and managing heterogeneity arising from epigenomic instability intrinsic to cancer cells and from diverse signals from extrinsic microenvironments in which cancer cells reside.","Measuring, Modeling and Controlling Heterogeneity",9964674,U54CA209988,"['Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cell Line ', ' CellLine ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' In Vitro ', ' Leadership ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Electron Microscopy ', ' Patients ', ' Periodicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Proteins ', ' Reagent ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Stress ', ' Systems Analysis ', ' Systems Analyses ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Work ', ' Immunofluorescence Immunologic ', ' Immunofluorescence ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Custom ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Measurement ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Cell Components ', ' Cell Structure ', ' Cellular Structures ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Malignant Cell ', ' cancer cell ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' light microscopy ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Heterograft ', ' Heterologous Transplantation ', ' Xenograft ', ' Xenotransplantation ', ' xeno-transplant ', ' xeno-transplantation ', ' Xenograft procedure ', ' everolimus ', ' SDZ RAD ', ' data management ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' outreach ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' bio-imaging ', ' biomedical imaging ', ' bioimaging ', ' Genomics ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' Microarray-Based Analysis ', ' microarray analyses ', ' microarray technology ', ' Microarray Analysis ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Data ', ' Educational Materials ', ' breast tumor cell ', ' Breast Cancer Cell ', ' in vivo ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Clonal Expansion ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' meta data ', ' Metadata ', ' TNBC ', ' triple-negative breast cancer ', ' triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma ', ' resistance to therapy ', ' resistant to therapy ', ' therapeutic resistance ', ' treatment resistance ', ' therapy resistant ', ' epigenomics ', ' image visualization ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' data integration ', ' Cancer cell line ', ' Imaging technology ', ' resistant ', ' Resistance ', ' analytical tool ', ' combinatorial ', ' Cellular model ', ' Cell model ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' open source ', ' network models ', ' tumor ', ' FDA approved ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' treatment response ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapy ', ' targeted treatment ', ' quantitative imaging ', ' MDA-MB-468 ', ' bio-printing ', ' bioprinting ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' Infrastructure ', ' computational suite ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' Computer Models ', ' Visualization ', ' feature extraction ', ' ']",NCI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,U54,2020,2053370,OR-03,-0.06564321278827515
"Neuroimaging Analysis Center (NAC) Project Summary/Abstract The ability to access huge cohorts of patient medical records and radiology data, the emergence of ever-more detailed imaging modalities, and the availability of unprecedented computer processing power marks the pos- sibility for a new era in neuroimaging, disease understanding, and patient treatment. To unlock the full medical potential made possible by these new technologies, new algorithms and clinically-relevant techniques must be developed by close collaboration between computer scientists, physicians, and medical researchers. We are excited to propose a national resource center with the goal of finding new ways of extracting disease characteristics from advanced imaging and computation, and to make these methods available to the larger medical community through a proven methodology of world-class research, open-source software, and exten- sive collaboration. The overarching theme for this P41 renewal is the discovery and analysis of novel imaging phenotypes to characterize disease. We use the term imaging phenotypes to describe patterns or features of disease that can be detected through imaging (predominantly MRI) followed by machine learning, statistical analysis, feature detection, and correlation with other indicators of disease such as structured patient infor- mation. The three proposed Technology Research & Development (TR&D) projects address this common question us- ing a variety of complementary approaches and clinical testbeds. TR&D 1 addresses microstructure of tissue, including novel imaging methods to detect tumor microstructure. TR&D 2 investigates rich spatial patterns of disease extracted from clinical imaging with a focus on cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative conditions such as stroke. Finally, TR&D 3 proposes novel image and connectivity-based features that can be correlated with a variety of diseases, with a clinical emphasis on pediatric brain development. Technical innovation will be driven by intense collaboration between the TR&Ds and key collaborators in neurosurgery, neurology, and pe- diatrics. The TR&Ds will leverage recent important developments in the fields of image acquisition, machine learning, and data science to identify and exploit novel imaging phenotypes of disease. Building on our long history of developing clinically-relevant methods, each TR&D includes a translational and clinical validation aim to ensure our work is clinically relevant and effective at meeting the driving clinical goals. NAC's proven software engi- neering, translation, and dissemination infrastructure, along with its established network of academic, medical, and industrial partners, enhance the center's value as a national resource.

"Psoriasis Center of Research Translation The Psoriasis Center of Research Translation at Case Western Reserve University (CORT) will advance translational discovery and application in psoriasis using a cutting-edge systems biology approach that integrates patient-centered data within a rich and synergistic /collaborative institutional environment. We will leverage extensive preclinical, clinical and translational resources with the expertise and experience of our CWRU interdisciplinary research team, which encompasses bioinformatics, micro/myocobiome, psoriasis patient care, cutaneous immunology and transgenic models.  The overall goal of the CORT is to combine new bioinformatic methodologies with advanced murine and human experimental approaches to translate scientific findings into clinical applications that more nimbly advance therapy for psoriasis and related inflammatory comorbidities. Our highly innovative, synergistic and cross-disciplinary CORT model will use a collaborative research project (CRP) as a central hub with bi- directional input from 2 highly interactive research cores, to refine and test hypotheses, identify and test drug leads and advance understanding of psoriasis and related inflammatory comorbidities. To do so, the CRP will integrate input from the: 1) Preclinical Modeling Core (PMC), that will provide and customize our many validated, unique transgenic psoriasiform animal models and translatable human xenograft approaches, essential to translating new mediator/pathway roles and drug leads; 2) Applied Meta-`Omics Core (AMC), that will apply multi-platform (transcriptome, metabolome, micro/mycobiome) bioinformatics to individual patient and murine samples to identify novel pathway-specific targets. Iterative experimental testing of these targets and feedback from the PMC and CRP will identify key novel pathways critical for psoriasis pathogenesis likely to benefit from intervention by new drugs or repurposed existing drugs for psoriasis therapy.  Our patient-centered translational approach will exploit and enhance a novel, comprehensive and highly annotated database of ~850 psoriasis/psoriatic arthritis single-patient case records that combines clinical information derived from CLEARPATH (an Ohio medical provider consortium-based unified EMR repository for research access), with inflammation markers that stratify subsets. Into each patient's EMR, we will directly integrate his/her meta'Omics data created by the AMC working with the CRP, to create an 'Omics-integrated EMR (EMRi) data set. These cohesive multi-platform personal data records will identify psoriasis patient endotypes based upon unique perturbations identified from their “meta'Omics” analyses. Our overarching hypothesis is that by powerfully combining existing and developing psoriasis basic science datasets, patient records, bioinformatics and computational systems biology with bi-directional mouse and human studies, we will identify new therapeutic targets and repurposed drugs that can be expeditiously moved to clinical trials, improving psoriasis treatment and patient care. The Psoriasis CORT at Case Western Reserve University and University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center uses emerging capabilities of data analyses that can assemble many aspects of a single psoriasis patient in great detail, including their gene expression in skin and blood cells, the skin microbes (both bacterial and fungal) and the clinical features that are recorded in their electronic medical record (EMR). Using advanced computer algorithms to compare in-house patient data against externally available large databases, we can identify drugs already approved by the FDA that may be repurposed to treat psoriasis, and validate/invalidate them in animal models and patient cells.",Psoriasis Center of Research Translation,10005116,P50AR070590,"['Psoriatic Arthritis ', ' Arthritic Psoriasis ', '

Simmons, MD (The Hallam Hurt Endowed Professor in Pediatrics). The Center is comprised of 71 members from 18 Departments and 5 Schools, with almost equal representation of basic and clinician-scientists drawn from the Perelman School of Medicine (PSOM) and Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP). The CEET has built an institutional, regional and national identity in environmental health sciences (EHS) in the absence of a School of Public Health and Department of EHS at Penn. The synergistic combination of basic and clinician-scientists within the CEET promotes translational environmental health research that addresses fundamental questions and translates knowledge into action to have a major impact on human health and disease consistent with the NIEHS Strategic Plan. The CEET mission is to “elucidate the mechanistic links between environmental exposures and human disease, and translate findings into action to improve the health of vulnerable individuals, and local, national, and global communities”. This mission is accomplished through five aims. In Aim 1: We use a flexible thematic area structure to conduct translational environmental health research to improve precision public health. Our current themes are in Air Pollution & Lung Health; Environmental Exposures & Cancer; Windows-of- Susceptibility; and Environmental Neuroscience. Each thematic area integrates the pillars or exposure science, adverse outcome constructs (pathways and networks) to explain the phenome with translation to communities and human subjects. In Aim 2: We conduct bi-directional communication with communities in S.E and N.E. Pennsylvania and use community engagement to set the research agenda for the CEET. In Aim 3: We provide a facility core structure to promote precision public health. Our Integrative Health Sciences Facility Core is adept in human subject study design and in conducting population exposure services, using cartographic modeling, GIS tools and biosensors. Biomarkers of exposure and effect are measured in our Translational Biomarker Core which conducts mass spectrometric assays at a level of precision and accuracy difficult to emulate elsewhere. The Exposure Biology Informatics Core brings to bear the power of computation, machine learning and AI to predict the toxicity of unknowns and integrate Big-data sets to recognize patterns in “omics” data and predict adverse outcomes. In Aim 4: We build capacity in environmental health sciences by funding pilot projects to Early Stage Investigators (ESI) and to senior investigators conducting environmental health research for the first time. In Aim 5: We cultivate the careers of ESI through a transformative Environmental Health Scientist Support Program that provides mentoring, grant proposal review, environmental health and Facility Core workshops. OVERALL : NARRATIVE The Center of Excellence in Environmental Toxicology (CEET) conducts research that links environmental exposures, to adverse outcomes and translates its findings to human subjects and communities to identify the most vulnerable and improve prevention, intervention and treatment through precision public health. Bi- directional communication through the Community Engagement Core helps set the research agenda of the CEET and inform public health decision making.",Center of Excellence in Environmental Toxicology,9917966,P30ES013508,"['Air Pollution ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Asbestos ', ' Award ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae ', ' bear ', ' Beer ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Biology ', ' Cities ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Decision Making ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Environmental Health ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Pediatric Hospitals ', "" Children's Hospital "", ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lung ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' pulmonary ', ' Mentors ', ' Mission ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Pediatrics ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Philadelphia ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Schools ', ' medical schools ', ' medical college ', ' school of medicine ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Science ', ' Time ', ' Toxicology ', ' Training Programs ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' Measures ', ' Community Health Care ', ' Community Healthcare ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' career ', ' ecological toxicology ', ' environmental toxicology ', ' human subject ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' wasting ', ' Individual ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Funding ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Pattern ', ' Services ', ' health science research ', ' professor ', ' Informatics ', ' biological sensor ', ' Biosensor ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' member ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' Environment-Related Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Environmental Cancer ', ' Environmental Malignant Neoplasm ', ' environment related cancer ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' chemical informatics ', ' cheminformatics ', ' Address ', ' Core Facility ', ' Data ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Human Subject Research ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Research Training ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Research ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' NIEHS ', ' National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences ', ' next generation ', ' Exposure to Pb2+ ', ' Pb exposed ', ' Pb exposure ', ' Pb2+ Exposure ', ' Pb2+ exposed ', ' exposed to lead ', ' exposure to Pb ', ' exposure to lead ', ' lead exposed ', ' lead exposure ', ' integrative healing ', ' integrative health ', ' Integrative Medicine ', ' Population ', ' human disease ', ' human exposure ', ' exposed human population ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' Superfund ', ' phenome ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' adverse consequence ', ' adverse outcome ', ' BigData ', ' Big Data ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,P30,2020,1616900,PA-03,-0.005530937518730376
"Microdata for Analysis of Early Life Conditions, Health, and Population Project Summary This project will enhance and develop the only source of data that provides core information about work, education, income, and migration for the entire U.S. population. This unique resource allows us to observe today's late-life population when they were young. This allows a prospective view of the impact of early-life environments and socioeconomic status on health and well-being in later life. The massive database describes the characteristics of all 133 million persons who resided in the United States in 1940. The data have been available for only a brief period, but are already having a profound impact on scientific research. They are the primary data source for at least 19 sponsored projects, including nine funded by NIH and seven funded by NSF. Through May 2017, 104 investigators had produced 95 papers based on the data, including 22 articles, four books, three PhD dissertations, and 66 working papers. This project will improve the quality and usability of the database by correcting transcription errors; improving the coding, editing, and allocation of key variables; and introducing new data dissemination tools designed to simplify access to the data. The project will undertake three major activities to meet these objectives. 1. Incorporate new verified census information on name, age, sex, family relationship, race, marital status,  birthplace, and residence five years ago. 2. Improve coding, editing, and allocation for geographic variables, migration, occupation, and numerically-  coded variables such as income. 3. Apply new technologies to democratize access to the data through new data access tools and a virtual data  enclave for a restricted version of the data that contains names. This project is a highly cost-effective use of scarce resources to develop shared infrastructure for research, education, and policy-making on health and aging. The proposed improvement of data quality is urgent, and will provide a resource of unprecedented power for understanding the effects of public policies, social institutions, and environmental conditions on the health, well-being, and functioning of people, both over the life course and in their later years. Narrative This project will develop data for prospective analysis of the impact of early-life circumstances and environment on health outcomes in late life, including Alzheimer's disease.

"Developing a mechanistic neurobiological model of exposure therapy response based on fear extinction theory Project Summary I am applying for a Mentored Patient-Oriented Career Development Award (K23) to support my development into an independently funded translational clinical psychologist. My long-term career goal is to conduct a program of research that translates neurobiological models of anxiety and its treatment into guidance for real- life clinical decision-making. Currently, although exposure therapy is the best available treatment for anxiety disorders, 25% of patients do not respond to an adequate course of exposure therapy and we do not know why. A critical long-term goal is to improve exposure therapy response by tailoring therapy based on the neurobiological profile of each patient. Because the mechanism of exposure therapy is thought to be extinction learning, the proposed research aims to address this goal by directly linking exposure therapy response to extinction learning in a sample of adults with social anxiety disorder. Specifically, I aim to identify neurobiological features of extinction learning that predict successful recall, are associated with clinical symptoms, and predict therapy response. The project will use a paradigm that I developed and piloted to assess physiological and neuroimaging measures of extinction learning. The expected outcomes are an innovative mechanistic neurobiological model that can identify patients at risk of non-response, as well as specific, testable hypotheses for how to improve outcomes for these patients. In order for this project, and my broader career goals, to succeed, it is imperative that I have expertise related to exposure therapy, predictive modeling, analysis of self-report, physiological, and fMRI data, and traditional and biomarker-guided clinical trial designs. I already have expertise in the theory and implementation of exposure therapy, as well as the analysis of self-report and fMRI data. This K23 award would allow me to receive advanced training in (1) machine learning techniques for building and evaluating clinically relevant predictive models, (2) specific skills for analysis and interpretation of physiological data, and (3) traditional and biomarker-guided clinical trials. I have assembled an inter-disciplinary team of mentors at Stanford University that are ideally suited to guide my research and training. Dr. Leanne Williams (primary mentor, Department of Psychiatry) will provide expertise on using neurobiology to make treatment outcome predictions, and provide overall career development mentorship throughout the project. Dr. James Gross (co-mentor, Department of Psychology) will provide expertise on physiological data and its integration with self-report and fMRI data. Dr. Tze Lai (co-mentor, Department of Statistics) will provide expertise on predictive models and biomarker-guided clinical trial designs. The training and associated research will take place in the Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences Department at Stanford University, a world renowned hub of neuroscience and psychiatry research, and at Stanford's Center for Cognitive and Neurobiological Imaging, a state-of-the-art neuroimaging facility. Project Narrative Social anxiety disorder affects as many as 12% of Americans, resulting in significant distress and disability. Although exposure therapy is one of the best treatments available, as many as 25% of patients do not respond and we do not know why. Extinction learning is thought to be the mechanism of exposure therapy, and the neuroscience of extinction learning has advanced significantly since exposure therapy was developed; however, there has been little application towards improved clinical outcomes. This project aims to improve exposure therapy response for patients with social anxiety disorder by directly linking exposure therapy response to the neurobiology of extinction learning.",Developing a mechanistic neurobiological model of exposure therapy response based on fear extinction theory,9904774,K23MH113708,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Animals ', ' Anxiety ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Extinction (Psychology) ', ' Extinction ', ' behavioral extinction ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Future ', ' Galvanic Skin Response ', ' Electrodermal Response ', ' Psychogalvanic Reflex ', ' Skin Electric Conductance ', ' skin conductance ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Laboratories ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Physiology ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Psychologist ', ' Psychology ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' statistics ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' waitlist ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Mediating ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Loudness ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Anterior ', ' Dorsal ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Distress ', ' learning extinction ', ' Funding ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Exposure to ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Severities ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Techniques ', ' Postdoc ', ' Research Associate ', ' post-doc ', ' post-doctoral ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' American ', ' cingulate cortex ', ' skills ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' K23 Award ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Program ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' predict therapeutic response ', ' predict therapy response ', ' predict treatment response ', ' therapy prediction ', ' treatment prediction ', ' treatment response prediction ', ' Prediction of Response to Therapy ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' K-Awards ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Training ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' Cognitive ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' scientific accomplishments ', ' scientific advances ', ' Scientific Advances and Accomplishments ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Research ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Outcome ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' customized therapy ', ' customized treatment ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' individualized therapy ', ' individualized treatment ', ' patient specific therapies ', ' patient specific treatment ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' tailored therapy ', ' tailored treatment ', ' unique treatment ', ' individualized medicine ', ' predictive biomarkers ', ' predictive molecular biomarker ', ' predictive marker ', ' anxious symptom ', ' anxiety symptoms ', ' social anxiety ', ' Social Anxiety Disorder ', ' treatment of anxiety disorders ', ' anxious individuals ', ' anxious ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' outcome prediction ', ' improved outcome ', ' recruit ', ' patient specific response ', ' responsive patient ', ' patient response ', ' ']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K23,2020,186408,CA-18,-0.013298024673205133

"Knowledge Management Center for Illuminating the Druggable Genome SUMMARY The understudied protein targets that are the focus of the implementation phase of the Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) project need to be placed in the contexts of gene-sets/pathways, drugs/small-molecules, diseases/phenotypes, and cells/tissues. By extending our previous methods, we will impute knowledge about the understudied potential target protein kinases, GPCRs, and ion channels listed in the RFA using machine learning strategies. To establish this classification system, we will organize data from many omics- and literature- based resources into attribute tables where genes are the rows and their attributes are the columns. Examples of such attribute tables include gene or protein expression in cancer cell lines (CCLE) or human tissues (GTEx), changes in expression in response to drug perturbations or single-gene knockdowns (LINCS), regulation by transcription factors based on ChIP-seq data (ENCODE), and phenotypes in mice observed when single genes are knocked out (KOMP). In total, we will process and abstract data from over 100 resources. We will then predict target functions, target association with pathways, small-molecules/drugs that modulate the activity and expression of the target, and target relevance to human disease. To further validate such predictions, we will employ text mining to identify knowledge that corroborates with the data mining predictions, perform molecular docking of predicted small molecules using homology modeling, and seek associations between variants and human diseases by mining electronic medical records (EMR) together with genomic profiling of thousands of patients. In addition, we will develop innovative data visualization tools to allow users to interact with all the collected data, and develop social networking software to build communities centered around proteins/genes/targets as well as biological topics including pathways, cell types, drugs/small-molecules, and diseases. Overall, we will develop an invaluable resource that will accelerate target and drug discovery.

"Patient Oriented Research and Mentorship and Training in Functional Neuroimaging of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder ABSTRACT  This K24 Mid-Career Investigator Career Development Award seeks support for training and mentorship for Christopher Pittenger, MD, Ph.D., a well-established, tenured Associate Professor in Psychiatry at Yale University, Director of the Yale OCD Research Clinic, and Assistant Chair for Translational Research in the Department of Psychiatry. Dr. Pittenger leads a robust patient-oriented research (POR) research program, which is integrated with his basic/translational lab-based research and has produced important new insights into the neurobiological underpinnings and novel treatment avenues for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and Tourette syndrome (TS). Dr. Pittenger has a long-standing commitment to mentorship; most notably, he is Co-Director of the Neuroscience Research Training Program (NRTP), the research track within the Yale psychiatry residency.  The training plan supported by this grant will allow Dr. Pittenger to increase his skills in quantitative analysis, with a focus on advanced statistical methods and on the design and analysis of fMRI studies. These are areas in which he already has active research with expert collaborators; the aim of the proposed training plan is to enhance his own proficiency to make him a more effective collaborator and mentor in these important domains. Additional training is focused on his own abilities as a mentor and leader, with the goal of increasing his efficacy in the management of his own research groups and in effective and individualized mentorship. These training activities will take place in the context of two NIMH- funded research studies. The first, R01 MH116038, is a recently funded grant on which Dr. Pittenger is co-PI with his close collaborator Alan Anticevic and deploys cutting-edge imaging technology and data analysis approaches to examine brain network connectivity parallels and predictors of therapeutic response to pharmacotherapy in OCD. The second, R01 MH100068, is a grant with collaborator Michelle Hampson that is developing real-time fMRI neurofeedback as a probe and potential treatment for OCD, with promising early results. These two exciting projects provide a fruitful vehicle for the proposed training in statistics and neuroimaging.  Dr. Pittenger will devote substantial time to mentoring under this award. One major focus will be the NRTP; the plan is for him to take over as Director of this program over the next few years, and to take the lead in the next resubmission of our T32 grant in 2022. Support of this increased mentorship effort is a second major motivation for the current application. Dr. Pittenger will also provide mentorship to students, postdocs, and junior faculty in his own research program and throughout the Department of Psychiatry  Together, these integrated plans for training, research, and mentorship will support a well-established mid-career investigator whose robust research program is producing important insights into the neurobiology and treatment of OCD and TS, and whose dedicated mentorship efforts are helping to establish a new generation of translationally grounded patient-oriented researchers in psychiatric neuroscience.

"Clinical Research Education in Genome Science (CREiGS) Project Summary/Abstract  The sensitivity and availability of omic technologies have enabled the genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic characterization of disease phenotypes, at the tissue and even the single cell level. This has allowed development of treatments that target specific disease subtypes, most notably in cancer treatment, and thus opened up opportunities for the development of precision/personalized medicine strategies for optimizing treatments for individual patients. Thus, new genomic science educational initiatives need to be continually updated to educate the clinical and translational workforce on how to effectively interpret and apply the findings from genomics studies. Patients of providers who have participated in these educational initiatives also benefit as it allows for more rapid integration of genomic study findings into the clinical care setting. Thus, in response to PAR-19-185, we propose to develop and implement the Clinical Research Education in Genome Science (CREiGS) program that will not only focus on the analysis of genomic data, but also on gene-expression data, the integration of these two data types, as well as introductory theory and application of statistical and machine learning methods. Specifically we propose to accomplish the following specific aims: 1. Develop and successfully implement the online and in-person phases of CREiGS to increase the methodologic ingenuity by which researchers tackle important genomics-related clinical problems. 2. Establish a Diversity Recruitment External Advisory Board to ensure that the most effective strategies are employed to recruit URM doctoral students, postdoctoral fellows, and faculty from academic institutions nationwide into CREiGS. 3. Enhance the dissemination phase of CREiGS by packaging and uploading the asynchronous lectures and the online critical thinking/problem solving assessments with solutions for publicly available, online teaching resources. 4. Implement effective methods to evaluate the efficacy of CREiGS by examining:1) the participants' grasp of the CREiGS core competencies, 2) the clarity and quality of the curriculum, 3) program logistics and operation, and 4) the participants' short-term and long-term success attributed to participation in CREiGS. In summary, we posit that CREiGS will provide participants with a solid foundation in genomics science to answer complex, clinical questions. We believe that CREiGS supports the mission of the NHGRI by providing researchers with rigorous training to “accelerate medical breakthroughs that improve human health.” Project Narrative The sensitivity and availability of omic technologies have allowed for the development of treatments that target specific disease subtypes, most notably in cancer treatment, and thus opened up opportunities for the development of precision/personalized medicine strategies for optimizing treatments for individual patients.

"The Nomenclature of Human and Vertebrate Genes PROJECT SUMMARY - HGNC The core objective of the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) is to enable effective communication and data exchange between everyone with an interest in human genes, by providing a unique, concise and standardized gene symbol and name for every human gene. As usage of genomic data increases in healthcare the need for a consistent language for genes becomes ever more vital. Aim 1 of this proposal will ensure the continuity of standardized naming of novel human protein-coding genes, long and small non-protein-coding RNA (ncRNA) genes, and pseudogenes. In particular all putative novel protein coding loci will require careful consideration; as active members of the Consensus Coding Sequence (CCDS) consortium, HGNC can ensure that named loci accurately reflect the current expert manual annotations provided by consortium members. Aim 2 concentrates on renaming newly characterized human genes that are currently assigned a placeholder symbol; some genes with a phenotype-based nomenclature will also be considered for reassignment. These updates will reflect functional information, aid name transferal to orthologous genes, and avoid confusion. This round of revision will be a precursor to a nomenclature freeze for the majority of protein coding genes. Aim 3 focusses on coordinating gene naming across vertebrates, collaborating with the six existing vertebrate gene nomenclature committees (mouse, rat, chicken, Anolis, Xenopus, zebrafish) which base their naming on human gene nomenclature. As the Vertebrate Gene Nomenclature Committee (VGNC) this effort will be extended to naming genes in vertebrates lacking a nomenclature authority, such as cow, dog and horse. Recent gene naming in chimpanzee enabled creation of the necessary tools, pipelines and databases required for naming in other species. Assignments will reflect homologous relationships to human genes. Aim 4 will investigate the utility of machine learning in automated assignment of systematic nomenclature to long ncRNA genes and vertebrate orthologs, and potentially to pseudogenes. Models will be trained on manually curated datasets to learn both explicit and implicit practices, and then applied at scale. Aim 5 will ensure consistent naming across vertebrates in complex and divergent gene families, which can reveal some of the most interesting evolutionary biology and account for key diversity between species, but require careful manual curation. HGNC will collaborate with experts to expand the successful gene naming in the pharmacologically relevant cytochrome P450 (CYP) family to further species, also working across species on two other complex key families involved in detoxification, the glutathione S-transferases (GST) and UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs). HGNC will also work with experts to expand gene naming of olfactory receptors, the largest vertebrate gene family, from mammals to other well- studied model organisms such as zebrafish, Xenopus and chicken. HGNC is the only group worldwide providing systematic and user-friendly names for genes that are used throughout biomedical science and clinical practice; this is a crucial facility, with increasing importance and direct benefits for public health. To ensure effective communication between basic and clinical researchers, practicing clinicians and patients, there has to be a consistent well managed set of names for all human genes, which HGNC has provided since 1979. Having these names enables new discoveries, avoids confusion and prevents patient harm, by helping to ensure that everyone refers to a given gene using the same name.",The Nomenclature of Human and Vertebrate Genes,9937764,U24HG003345,"['Biology ', ' Cattle ', ' Bovine Species ', ' bovid ', ' bovine ', ' cow ', ' Chickens ', ' Gallus domesticus ', ' Gallus gallus ', ' Gallus gallus domesticus ', ' Communication ', ' Confusion ', ' Confusional State ', ' Mental Confusion ', ' Cytochrome P450 ', ' Cytochrome P-450 ', ' Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System ', ' Cytochrome P450 Family Gene ', ' P450 ', ' Canis familiaris ', ' Canine Species ', ' Dogs ', ' Dogs Mammals ', ' canine ', ' domestic dog ', ' Family ', ' Freezing ', ' Future ', ' Gene Duplication ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Glutathione S-Transferase ', ' EC 2.5.1.18 ', ' Glutathione Organic Nitrate Ester Reductase ', ' Glutathione S-Alkyltransferase ', ' Glutathione S-Aralkyltransferase ', ' Glutathione S-Aryltransferase ', ' Glutathione S-Epoxidetransferase ', ' Glutathione Transferase ', ' Heme Transfer Protein ', ' Ligandins ', ' S-Hydroxyalkyl Glutathione Lyase ', ' glutathione aralkyltransferase ', ' glutathione aryltransferase ', ' Goals ', ' Equus caballus ', ' Domestic Horse ', ' Equine ', ' Equine Species ', ' Equus przewalskii ', ' Horses ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Language ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Mammals ', ' Mammalia ', ' Manuals ', ' Drug Metabolic Detoxication ', ' Drug Metabolic Detoxification ', ' Metabolic Drug Detoxications ', ' Metabolism of Toxic Agents ', ' detoxification ', ' Study models ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Names ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Proteins ', ' Pseudogenes ', ' Public Health ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publishing ', ' Rattus ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Rat ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' Science ', ' Standardization ', ' Glucuronosyltransferase ', ' Glucuronic Transferase ', ' Glucuronyltransferase ', ' UDP Glucuronosyltransferase ', ' UDP Glucuronyl Transferase ', ' Vertebrates ', ' Vertebrate Animals ', ' vertebrata ', ' Work ', ' Xenopus ', ' Xenopus sp.

"Revealing the transcriptional and developmental mechanisms of interneuron identity Cortical GABAergic interneurons are critical components of neural circuitry, and their dysfunction has been linked to neurodevelopmental diseases. Although the diversity of interneurons is not disputed, both the extent of their heterogeneity and the gene regulatory mechanisms that drive it remain unclear. Recent advances in single cell RNA-sequencing technology have shed new light on this issue, enabling the prediction of novel interneuron subtypes based on gene expression. Cross-species meta-analysis would provide key insight into conserved mechanisms of interneuron diversity. However, cross-study integration remains a major challenge. I hypothesize that interneuron identity is defined by unifying molecular processes across species. This project is designed to reveal these processes by using an integrative, cross-species approach to explore the transcriptional, epigenetic, and developmental mechanisms that govern interneuron diversity. First, I have shown that mouse interneuron subtypes replicably express genes associated with cell-cell communication, enabling cross-dataset meta-analysis. The goal of Aim 1 is to use improved computational and phylogenetic methods to define homologous interneuron subtypes across species and identify robust gene targets. Second, preliminary investigation of single cell methylome-sequencing data indicates that it can be readily aligned with expression data. In Aim 2 I will use machine learning methods to generate networks from epigenomic and expression data and identify subtype-specific regulatory features. Third, I have shown that transcriptional profiles from developing neurons can be quantitatively assessed with respect to adult expression data. Aim 3 will use meta-analytic aggregation of temporal inference methods to enable cross-dataset comparisons and define conserved developmental gene programs. These studies will reveal a multidimensional portrait of interneuron molecular identity and enable genetic access to these cell types, a key aim of the BRAIN Initiative. I also propose an extensive training plan that will support my transition to independence. CSHL provides an outstanding research environment, with unequaled opportunities for scientific discussion, advanced skills training and career development. I have assembled an exceptional team of collaborators and mentors who will help me to achieve my goals. Dr. Jesse Gillis, expert in transcriptome meta-analysis, and Dr. Josh Huang, expert in GABAergic interneuron identity, will be my mentors. Dr. Bing Ren, Dr. Adam Siepel, Dr. Guoping Feng, Dr. Jessica Tollkuhn and Dr. Michael Greenberg will be collaborators and members of my advisory committee, ensuring that my research will be of the highest caliber. My training will also involve coursework in multiomics data integration and comparative genomics, and I will continue my professional development by presenting at international conferences, mentoring students and attending workshops at CSHL. Together, the proposed studies and professional training will ensure my successful transition to an independent position at a major university where I will lead a lab that will advance the goals of the BRAIN Initiative. Interneurons are key components of neural circuitry, acting as the cellular `brakes' that dampen neuronal activity. Although it has long been known that interneurons come in many different shapes and sizes, both the extent of this diversity and its consequences for brain function remain unclear. In this project, we propose that by combining information about the gene activity and epigenetic landscapes of interneurons across multiple species we will generate an integrated, multi-layered portrait of interneuron diversity which we can use to understand brain",Revealing the transcriptional and developmental mechanisms of interneuron identity,9898481,K99MH120050,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Bar Codes ', ' barcode ', ' Biology ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cell Communication ', ' Cell Interaction ', ' Cell-to-Cell Interaction ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chromatin ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Fire - disasters ', ' Fires ', ' fire ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Developmental Gene ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' regulatory gene ', ' trans acting element ', ' Genetic Engineering ', ' Genetic Engineering Biotechnology ', ' Genetic Engineering Molecular Biology ', ' Recombinant DNA Technology ', ' genetically engineered ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Institutes ', ' Interneurons ', ' Connector Neuron ', ' Intercalary Neuron ', ' Intercalated Neurons ', ' Internuncial Cell ', ' Internuncial Neuron ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Maintenance ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Primates ', ' Primates Mammals ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Universities ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' symposium ', ' lateral geniculate ', ' lateral geniculate nucleus ', ' Lateral Geniculate Body ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Task Forces ', ' advisory team ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Gene Targeting ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' cell type ', ' Techniques ', ' skills training ', ' developmental neurobiology ', ' experience ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' career development ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Portraits ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Diameter ', ' Caliber ', ' Data ', ' Developmental Process ', ' International ', ' Resolution ', ' Cell Growth and Maintenance ', ' Cell Maintenance ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Phylogenetics ', ' Phylogenetic Analysis ', ' Validation ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' epigenomics ', ' neuroinformatics ', ' data integration ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' comparative genomics ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' methylome ', ' differentially expressed ', ' transcriptional differences ', ' differential expression ', ' Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies initiative ', ' BRAIN initiative ', ' student-led learning ', ' student mentoring ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' transcriptome ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' genomic data ', ' scRNA-seq ', ' single cell RNA-seq ', ' single cell RNAseq ', ' single-cell RNA sequencing ', ' multiple omic data ', ' Multiomic Data ', ' large scale data sets ', ' large scale datasets ', ' large scale data ', ' feature selection ', ' mouse genetics ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NIMH,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,K99,2020,118421,NY-03,-0.012269297619996088
"Knowledge Management Center for Illuminating the Druggable Genome The main goal of the Knowledge Management Center (KMC) for the Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) program is to aggregate, update and articulate protein-centric data, information and knowledge for the entire human proteome with emphasis on understudied proteins from the 3 families that are the focus of the IDG (“IDG List”). The long-term objective of the KMC is to encourage and support biomedical research aimed at understudied proteins by providing an extensive resource of data, information, knowledge, methods and reagents for the entire human proteome, and to support the growing online community focused on understudied proteins. With focus on the IDG List and human proteins, the KMC will enable support for expanded coverage for non-human proteins of therapeutic interest and other associated human health data, in order to catalyze novel biomedical discoveries. To support the overall IDG objective, and to maintain, update and improve these integrated resources, the KMC draws upon expertise from multiple knowledge domains, specifically biology, chemistry and medicine, as well as computer science, graphic design and web programming. Specifically, for the Phase 2 of the IDG KMC we propose 4 Aims:1. Create an automated workflow that captures relevant public data for the entire proteome and manual annotations for the IDG list. The KMC knowledge management system will be built around knowledge graphs, focused on five major branches of the target knowledge tree, tkt: Genotype, Phenotype, Expression, Structure & Function, and Interactions & Pathways, respectively. Aim 2: Design, develop and implement a protein knowledgebase with Data Analytics support. Our protein-centric biomedical knowledge base, TCKB (Target Central Knowledgebase) will be comprised of the data, knowledge and information container, together with its codebase and software pipelines. TCKB will be the repository for experimental, processed and computed data and reagents originating from the IDG DRGCs (Data and Resource Generation Centers). We will provide informatics and modeling support for DRGC activities. Aim 3: We will expand, improve and maintain Pharos. Particularly “knowledge packages,” support automated data summaries for Protein Dossiers, and actively seek feedback from our community. Aim 4. Outreach to scientific community. We will support a series of activities that will leverage TCKB, Pharos and other IDG resources to increase adoption of IDG work, while observing FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) principles for our knowledgebase, portal and pipelines. The KMC will engage in community outreach by leading tutorials and feedback sessions and dissemination of the Pharos system. To meet its goals, the KMC will coordinate all core activities in close coordination with the IDG Steering Committee and IDG Project Scientists (PS), and include members of the IDG Consortium (IDG- C), other NIH Common Fund programs, NIH Commons, as well as other initiatives.

"The Patricia Levy Zusman International Workshop on Neuroregeneration at Houston Methodist Project Summary/Abstract This R13 was conceived through discussions with investigators in the fields of neurostimulation and neuroplasticity at the Houston Methodist Research Institute (HMRI). In 2017, we held an R13-funded pilot workshop that combined research in neural stimulation with new insight into the molecular understanding of neural plasticity and regeneration. The results of said workshop indicated a strongly positive response by participants and interest in further catalysts of working collaboration. Thus, in 2019 we introduced new ways to increase relationship development and crossover opportunities among attendees, one of which was a blitz session wherein newly formed (i.e., established at the 2019 Workshop) collaborative teams competed for two $5K mini grants that supported travel to and from each other’s institutions. Given the overwhelmingly positive feedback, this will continue. On March 3rd-6th 2021, we will host the third Patricia Levy Zusman International Workshop on Neuroregeneration (Zusman Workshop) with a focus on the intersection of electrical activity, brain connectomics and molecular neural plasticity. Our specific aims are to: 1) formulate new ideas to fill the gap between physiology and functional-based brain stimulation technologies and the molecular and cellular understanding of innate neuronal plasticity; 2) integrate promising trainees into plenary sessions; and 3) ensure trainees participate in substantial discussions and interactions with faculty members. As in previous workshops, the 2021 Workshop will be held at HMRI. HMRI is part of the Texas Medical Center (TMC), a one-of-its-kind medical and research hub that fosters cross-institutional collaboration, creativity, and innovation located in one of the United States’ most diverse cities: Houston Texas. A key aspect of the Zusman Workshop is the active inclusion and participation of trainees, particularly women and under-represented minorities. We will encourage their participation through travel scholarships and via active promotion and recruitment throughout the TMC. Also, the Workshop seeks to promote the voices of graduate and postdoctoral trainees. As such, the 2021 Workshop will include several trainee poster sessions as well as a session dedicated to trainee presentations (given by travel awardees). Further, goal-oriented breakout sessions led by senior/early-stage investigators and selected trainees will foster discussion and promote cross-trainingand collaborationamong participants. Overall, the format of this workshop is distinct from established physiology conferences and dedicated neural regeneration conferences in several ways. It is: 1) highly focused on the gap between molecular regeneration and electrophysiology/stimulation, 2) concept driven by clinicians and experimentalists currently problem solving in human therapy, and 3) focused on the establishment of cross training and expertise development in graduate, post-graduate, and clinical fellows. We believe the 2021 Zusman Workshop will ignite collaborative networks between investigators and produce novel collaborative teams that will develop innovative, transdisciplinary methods, technologies, and treatments to modulate performance in the damaged nervous system. Project Narrative A large gap exists between researchers who seek to develop methods of neural plasticity and long-distance regeneration and experts who study the outcomes and safety of brain computer interfaces. Therefore, in 2017, we developed and held the first biannual Patricia Levy Zusman International Workshop on Neuroregeneration, which focused on the intersection of electrical activity, brain connectomics, and molecular neural plasticity. In 2021, our goals are to 1) build upon the success of our previous two workshops by inviting back and sponsoring travel for rising star alumni to return and participate; 2) create an interdisciplinary discussion of the gap in these disciplines, and 3) stimulate working groups, training opportunities, and translational approaches to speed progress in directed, stimulation-based

"Systems biology frameworks to unravel mechanisms driving complex disorders Project Summary/Abstract This application proposes a training program to integrate the PI, Dr. Varadan's previous research efforts in informatics and machine learning into investigations pertaining to the etiology and progression of Barrett's Esophagus, a gastrointestinal disorder of significant public health interest. Much of Dr. Varadan's previous research has involved developing intelligent algorithms and informatics approaches to decode the interconnections within complex biological systems, with only a basic understanding of the clinical needs and complexities involved in translational research. The proposed project would provide a broad and in-depth mentored experience focused on clinical and biological aspects of Barrett's Esophagus, as well as added knowledge in the use of preclinical model systems to investigate biological mechanisms. The overall goal is to expand the PI's experience and training in the design and conduct of translational studies focused on gastrointestinal (GI) diseases. This objective will be achieved through a combination of didactic and research activities conducted under an exceptional mentoring team of translational researchers at Case Western Reserve University, spanning achievements across clinical management of GI disorders, molecular genetics and inflammatory processes associated with diseases of the gut. Accordingly, this proposal leverages Dr. Varadan's computational background to address an urgent and unmet need within the biomedical research community to develop reliable analytic approaches that can quantify signaling network activities in individual biological samples by integrating multi-omics measurements. We recently conceived a systems biology computational framework, InFlo, which integrates molecular profiling data to decode the functional states of cellular/molecular processes underpinning complex human diseases. Barrett's esophagus is one such complex disease gaining increasing importance to public health, as it is the known precursor to the deadly cancer, esophageal adenocarcinoma. Given that the mechanisms underlying the etiology and pathogenesis of Barrett's Esophagus remain elusive, a major objective of this proposal is to employ the InFlo framework combined molecular profiles derived from primary tissue cohorts, in vitro and in vivo model systems to establish the molecular roadmap of BE pathogenesis and disease recurrence, thus elucidating unifying mechanisms underlying this disease. This systems biology approach would enable the development of evidence-based, diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers for Barrett's esophagus and inform preventive strategies within at-risk populations. Project Narrative This proposal details a novel systems biology approach to enable seamless integration of patient molecular data to decipher the mechanisms underlying complex human diseases. Using this novel integrative analytics approach, we propose to resolve the molecular basis for the development and recurrence of Barrett's Esophagus, a disease with significant public health importance, since it is a known precursor to a lethal esophageal cancer and the mechanisms underpinning this disease remain largely unknown. The findings from our proposed research will enable the development of new diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers and will also inform preventive strategies in high-risk patient populations.",Systems biology frameworks to unravel mechanisms driving complex disorders,9888378,K25DK115904,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Award ', ' Barrett Esophagus ', ' Barrett Syndrome ', ' Barrett Ulcer ', ' Columnar Epithelial-Lined Lower Esophagus ', ' Columnar-Lined Esophagus ', ' esophageal intestinal metaplasia ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cell Culture Techniques ', ' cell culture ', ' Communities ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Epithelium ', ' Epithelium Part ', ' Esophagitis ', ' Esophagus ', ' Exhibits ', ' Follow-Up Studies ', ' Followup Studies ', ' Gastrointestinal Diseases ', ' gastrointestinal disorder ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' In Vitro ', ' Interleukin-1 beta ', ' Beta Proprotein Interleukin 1 ', ' IL-1 beta ', ' IL-1 β ', ' IL-1-b ', ' IL-1β ', ' IL1-Beta ', ' IL1-β ', ' IL1B Protein ', ' IL1F2 ', ' IL1β ', ' Interleukin 1beta ', ' Interleukin-1β ', ' Preinterleukin 1 Beta ', ' Maps ', ' Mentors ', ' Transgenic Mice ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Mucous Membrane ', ' Mucosa ', ' Mucosal Tissue ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Proteins ', ' Public Health ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Specificity ', ' stem cells ', ' Progenitor Cells ', ' Stomach ', ' gastric ', ' Systems Analysis ', ' Systems Analyses ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Training Programs ', ' Universities ', ' Competence ', ' Molecular Genetics ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' injuries ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' career ', ' gene manipulation ', ' genetically manipulate ', ' genetically perturb ', ' genetic manipulation ', ' Clinical ', ' Malignant ', ' Malignant -

"Development of Machine Learning Algorithms to Assess and Train Vesico-Urethral Anastomosis during Robot Assisted Radical Prostatectomy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT CANDIDATE (Andrew J. Hung, MD): My long-term goal is to establish a career in innovating training methods for robotic surgery which will lead to curtailing surgeon learning curve, and maximize patient safety. My first step towards that goal focuses on understanding objective metrics that measure surgeon performance, and how machine learning algorithms can process that data to guide training. I have developed a career development program that builds on my clinical training in robotic urologic surgery and prior research in surgical training. Through mentorship, a fellowship, and formal coursework, this K23 award will provide me the necessary support to develop expertise in 3 areas where I do not have formal training, yet are critical to my success: (1) Machine learning; (2) Surgical education; (3) Advanced statistical skills and study design. MENTORING TEAM: My career development and research plans leverage existing institutional resources, including the USC Machine Learning Center, led by co-primary mentor Dr. Yan Liu; and Keck Hospital of USC, the second busiest robotic center by volume in the United States and the USC Institute of Urology (led by co- primary mentor and chairman Dr. Inderbir Gill), home to pioneers of several urologic surgical techniques with a robust research apparatus supporting several NIH-funded clinical scientists. My mentoring team is complemented by co-mentor Dr. Robert Sweet, a DOD-funded expert on surgical education; career mentor Dr. Larissa Rodriguez, a federally funded clinician/scientist experienced in mentoring K awardees; educational psychology collaborator Dr. Kenneth Yates, an authority on cognitive task analysis; and consultant Dr. Anthony Jarc, at Intuitive Surgical who has supported much of the pilot data on objective performance metrics. The proposed K23 work truly requires the robust collaboration of experts in robotic surgery, education, and machine learning. RESEARCH: The learning curve for surgeons performing robot assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) is steep: over 100 cases. Current ‘gold standard’ methods of surgical assessment rely on subjective expert review, but such evaluations are time consuming and inconsistent. Nonetheless, credentialing a surgeon to perform robotic surgery has enormous implications - patient outcomes are at risk, and a surgeon’s career is on the line. Informed by my clinical expertise in robotic urological surgery and preliminary data, I will develop a novel method of utilizing machine learning (ML) algorithms to objectively assess robotic surgeon performance and to guide training for the vesico-urethral anastomosis (VUA), the most critical reconstructive part of the robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). I will develop and validate objective metrics directly captured from the da Vinci robot during the VUA (Aim 1), train machine learning algorithms to assess a surgeon’s performance of VUA (Aim 2), and utilize ML algorithms to guide surgeons learning the VUA (Aim 3). Armed with these data and skills from this award, I will be uniquely suited to utilize machine learning to generalize objective surgeon assessment for robot-assisted surgical procedures within and beyond urology. Finally, the results from this study will provide preliminary data for independent funding through mechanisms such as an NIH R01 grant. PROJECT NARRATIVE The learning curve for surgeons performing robot assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) for prostate cancer is steep, and current methods of evaluating surgeons require subjective and time-consuming expert review.

"Using clinical data to identify FDA-approved drugs for cancer prevention and therapeutic repurposing Project Summary/Abstract Clinical data collection is accelerating rapidly, and in the future it will include both provider- and patient- generated data. Hidden within this mass of noisy observational data are clues as to factors influencing disease onset and outcome. Finding ways to exploit this trove of disease data can unlock a new perspective on disease processes. We can tackle disease both from the bottom-up, from experimental data generated in the laboratory, and from the top down, from clinical phenomena observed across human populations. A particularly impactful and prevalent disease is cancer. Each tumor harbors a unique combination of mutations driving a distinct set of oncogenic processes. Targeted therapies have been proposed to pinpoint these mutations, potentially requiring a vast array of therapeutic options. Cancer treatment often fails when drug resistance arises, another result of the complex combinatorial nature of tumor alterations. Combination therapies have been proposed as an approach to interfere with multiple disease signals simultaneously. However, identifying effective drug combinations, and the cancer types in which they are effective, is experimentally infeasible, leading to a push for computational solutions. In this proposal, we combine methods from social sciences and biostatistics to find the causal effect of a drug on cancer onset from observational clinical data. Both increased and decreased cancer rates in drug-takers are of equal interest, as they can inform us of disease processes and provide clinical impact. We are particularly interested in finding drug combinations that impact cancer. These combination effects are unlikely to have been detected, and our clinical data provides a unique resource for observing the effects of tens of thousands of drug combinations. We will pool the resulting causal drug effect estimates across the many cancers present in our data. To gain insight into the cellular processes underlying clinical effect, we will examine the impact of known cancer-causing drugs in vitro, using large public cell line assays. The accompanying goal is to provide Dr. Rachel Melamed with a career development experience to become an independent scientist. Her research will use observational health data to understand the genesis of cancer, prevent the disease, and discover new therapeutic options. This proposal takes advantage of the interdisciplinary strengths of the University of Chicago in computation, biostatistics, and medicine, as well as institutional resources in terms of data access and infrastructure. Dr. Melamed has assembled a team consisting of complementary mentors and collaborators with expertise in computation, statistics, translational medicine, personalized therapy, and cancer therapy. The career development plan focuses on enhancing her statistics and machine learning skills with structured coursework and mentorship, and gaining experience in biomedical applications via applied work and mentorship. This will provide Dr. Melamed with skills to model observational data and to integrate the results with experimental data. Project Narrative Clinical data has been shown to hold patterns relating drugs to cancer onset. Using this data to find drugs that increase cancer rates will provide insight into the disease and an opportunity for preventing some cancer cases. Discovery of drugs, and particularly drug combinations, that reduce cancer rates could suggest low-cost new therapeutic options.",Using clinical data to identify FDA-approved drugs for cancer prevention and therapeutic repurposing,9963220,K01ES028055,"['Antineoplastic Agents ', ' Anti-Cancer Agents ', ' Antineoplastic Drugs ', ' Antineoplastics ', ' Cancer Drug ', ' Neoplastic Disease Chemotherapeutic Agents ', ' Tumor-Specific Treatment Agents ', ' anti-cancer drug ', ' anticancer agent ', ' anticancer drug ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cell Line ', ' CellLine ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Chicago ', ' Combined Modality Therapy ', ' Multimodal Therapy ', ' Multimodal Treatment ', ' combination therapy ', ' combined modality treatment ', ' combined treatment ', ' multi-modal therapy ', ' multi-modal treatment ', ' Data Collection ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Drug Combinations ', ' Drug resistance ', ' drug resistant ', ' resistance to Drug ', ' resistant to Drug ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' In Vitro ', ' Incidence ', ' Investments ', ' Joints ', ' Laboratories ', ' Libraries ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mining ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Patients ', ' Drug Prescriptions ', ' Drug Prescribing ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Science ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Social Sciences ', ' statistics ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Case Series ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' prematurity ', ' premature ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Development Plans ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Personal Medical History ', ' Personal Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Medical History ', ' disease onset ', ' disorder onset ', ' Onset of illness ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Malignant Cell ', ' cancer cell ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' life history ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' novel ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Drug Exposure ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' Genomics ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' cancer therapy ', ' Provider ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' precancerous ', ' premalignant ', ' in vitro Assay ', ' in vivo ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' cost ', ' Cancer cell line ', ' Population ', ' cancer type ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Cancerous ', ' Oncogenic ', ' combinatorial ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical effect ', ' translational medicine ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' tumor ', ' discover genes ', ' gene discovery ', ' FDA approved ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized medicine ', ' clinical predictors ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapy ', ' targeted treatment ', ' health data ', ' clinical investigation ', ' training opportunity ', ' Learning Skill ', ' disease heterogeneity ', ' data access ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' genomic data ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' econometrics ', ' side effect ', ' data infrastructure ', ' ']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,K01,2020,1,IL-01,-0.025163854948038446
"Enhancing open data sharing for functional genomics experiments: Measures to quantify genomic information leakage and file formats for privacy preservation Project Summary/Abstract: With the surge of large genomics data, there is an immense increase in the breadth and depth of different omics datasets and an increasing importance in the topic of privacy of individuals in genomic data science. Detailed genetic and environmental characterization of diseases and conditions relies on the large-scale mining of functional genomics data; hence, there is great desire to share data as broadly as possible. However, there is a scarcity of privacy studies focused on such data. A key first step in reducing private information leakage is to measure the amount of information leakage in functional genomics data, particularly in different data file types. To this end, we propose to to derive information-theoretic measures for private information leakage in different data types from functional genomics data. We will also develop various file formats to reduce this leakage during sharing. We will approach the privacy analysis under three aims. First, we will develop statistical metrics that can be used to quantify the sensitive information leakage from raw reads. We will systematically analyze how linking attacks can be instantiated using various genotyping methods such as single nucleotide variant and structural variant calling from raw reads, signal profiles, Hi-C interaction matrices, and gene expression matrices. Second, we will study different algorithms to implement privacy-preserving transformations to the functional genomics data in various forms. Particularly, we will create privacy-preserving file formats for raw sequence alignment maps, signal track files, three-dimensional interaction matrices, and gene expression quantification matrices that contain information from multiple individuals. This will allow us to study the sources of sensitive information leakages other than raw reads, for example signal profiles, splicing and isoform transcription, and abnormal three-dimensional genomic interactions. Third, we will investigate the reads that can be mapped to the microbiome in the raw human functional genomics datasets. We will use inferred microbial information to characterize private information about individuals, and then combine the microbial information with the information from human mapped reads to increase the re-identification accuracy in the linking attacks described in the second aim. We will use the tools to quantify the sensitive information and privacy-preserving file formats in the available datasets from large sequencing projects, such as the ENCODE, The Cancer Genome Atlas, 1,000 Genomes, gEUVADIS, and Genotype-Tissue Expression projects. Project Narrative: Sharing large-scale functional genomics data is critical for scientific discovery, but comes with important privacy concerns related to the possible misuse of such data. This proposal will quantify and manage the rieslkasted to releasing functional genomics datasets, based on integrating inferred genotypes from the raw sequence files, signal tracks, and microbiome mapped sequences. Finally, we will develop file formats, statistical methodologies, and related software for anonymization of functional genomics data that enable open sharing.",Enhancing open data sharing for functional genomics experiments: Measures to quantify genomic information leakage and file formats for privacy preservation,9970939,R01HG010749,"['Algorithms ', ' Biology ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Extravasation ', ' Leakage ', ' Spillage ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Institutes ', ' Laws ', ' Learning ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mining ', ' Motivation ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Privatization ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' RNA Splicing ', ' Splicing ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Measures ', ' Medical Research ', ' Privacy ', ' Sequence Alignment ', ' sequencing alignment ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Glean ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Pythons ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Individual ', ' Data Files ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Letters ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Smoker ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' human tissue ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' interest ', ' Isoforms ', ' Protein Isoforms ', ' QTL ', ' Quantitative Trait Loci ', ' microbial ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' single nucleotide variant ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Sampling ', ' functional genomics ', ' Genomics ', ' Provider ', ' data processing ', ' computerized data processing ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' genome sequencing ', ' Address ', ' Consent ', ' Data ', ' Process ', ' microbiome ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' file format ', ' data sharing ', ' TCGA ', ' The Cancer Genome Atlas ', ' ChIP Sequencing ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing ', ' ChIP-seq ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Data Science ', ' open-source data ', ' open science ', ' open data ', ' GTEx ', ' Genotype-Tissue Expression Project ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' genomic data ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' DNA seq ', ' DNAseq ', ' DNA sequencing ', ' large data sets ', ' large datasets ', ' privacy preservation ', ' ']",NHGRI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,523409,CT-03,-0.023705066104073604
"Boston University CCCR OVERALL ABSTRACT The Boston University CCCR will serve as a central resource for clinical research focused mostly on the most common musculoskeletal disorders, osteoarthritis and gout and will also provide research resources for investigator based research in scleroderma, spondyloarthritis, musculoskeletal pain and osteoporosis. Center grant funding has supported 30-35 papers annually in peer reviewed journals, most in the leading arthritis journals and some in leading general medical journals. This center has trained many of the leading clinical researchers in rheumatology throughout the US and internationally, and many of these former trainees have active collaborations with the center. We will include a broad research community and a core group of faculty in this CCCR. The research community's ready access to core faculty and to the sophisticated research methods and assistance they provide will enhance the clinical and translational research of the community and will increase collaborative opportunities for the core faculty and the community. The CCCR updates BU's historical focus on epidemiologic methods to include new approaches to causal inference and adds new methods in machine learning and mobile health.

"A robust platform for multiplexed, subcellular proteomic imaging in human tissue Project Summary Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging by Time of Flight (MIBI-TOF) uses secondary ion mass spectrometry and metal conjugated primary antibodies to simultaneously visualize dozens of proteins at subcellular resolution in a single tissue section. This technology is back compatible with archival formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tissue (FFPE) and has been used in peer-reviewed work to simultaneously visualize and quantify 36 proteins in retrospective human tissue cohorts. In line with the stated goals of the HuBMAP consortium to develop both “High-sensitivity, high-resolution imaging techniques that can rapidly provide spectral data over large areas of tissue” and “Quantitative imaging analysis tools, including automated 3D image segmentation, feature extraction, and image annotation,” the work outlined here will create a standardized, high throughput, and user-friendly workflow for using MIBI-TOF in basic and translational research to gain insight into how single cell phenotype and tissue structure are functionally-linked in health and disease. To achieve this, we will validate 100 FFPE antibodies and optimize ready-to-use multiplexed staining panels in lyophilized format that will permit storage for at least two years. Protocols and reagents for multiplexed signal amplification of protein and mRNA targets will be further refined, while next generation instrumentation will increase sample throughput to permit full tissue section imaging of up to 40 proteins in 1 hour. Standardized reagents and more robust instrumentation will be accompanied by an automated computational pipeline that utilizes a standard set of segmentation markers and machine learning to accurately identify nuclei and cell borders in any non-neural human tissue. This data will be used to cluster single cell events into functionally distinct populations according to morphology, protein expression, and histological distribution. The reagents and computational pipeline proposed here synergize with existing HuBMAP-funded platforms and could be readily generalized to virtually any high dimensional imaging modality. Thus, this work will not only provide a practical, back compatible imaging platform for high throughput multiplexed imaging, but will also accelerate development of other complimentary imaging technologies as well. Project Narrative Multiplexed ion beam imaging by time of flight (MIBI-TOF) is a new technology for visualizing dozens of proteins in standard clinical tissue biopsies at high resolution.

"N3C & All of Us Research Program Collaborative Project Project Summary/Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic presents unprecedented clinical and public health challenges. Though institutions collect large amounts of clinical data about COVID-19 cases, these datasets individually might not be diverse enough to draw population level conclusions. Also, statistical, machine learning, and causal analyses are most successful with large-scale data beyond what is available in any given organization. To tackle this problem, NCATS introduced the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), an open science, community-based initiative to share patient level data for analysis. The initiative requires participating institutions to share information about their COVID-19 patients in a standard-driven way, including demographics, vital signs, diagnoses, laboratory results, medications, and other treatments. The data from multiple institutions will be merged and consolidated, and access will be provided to investigators through a centralized analytical platform. The COVID-19 data sharing collaboration with the N3C initiative offers a mechanism to initiate collaborations with other NIH sponsored data sharing programs, such as the All of Us Research Program (AoURP). This administrative supplement will support efforts to clean and standardize data at VCU, and to transfer it to the N3C data repository. The supplement will also assist in introducing new services at the Wright Center to support our investigators to use the N3C resources. It will also enable collaboration with the AoURP by establishing a pipeline to collect and transmit consented patients' EHR data and by building on existing community outreach pathways to recruit additional participants for the AoURP. The project will be overseen by the PI/Executive Committee and supervised by the Director of Research Informatics. Procedures and services developed at our local CTSA hub will be shared and disseminated to the CTSA network. Project Narrative NIH/NCATS has been working on the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), which aims to build a centralized national data resource to be used by the research community to study the COVID-19 pandemic and identify potential treatments as the pandemic continues to evolve. The COVID-19 data sharing collaboration with the N3C initiative also offers a mechanism to initiate collaborations with the All of Us Research Program (AoURP).

"Tufts Clinical and Translational Science Institute (N3C Supplement) PROJECT SUMMARY Tufts Clinical and Translational Science Institute (Tufts CTSI) is based on the conviction that authentic involvement of the entire spectrum of clinical and translational research (CTR) is critical to fulfilling the promise of biomedical science for meeting the public's needs. This includes not only from translation from bench to bedside (T1 translation), but also, crucially for having health impact, translation into effective clinical practice (T2), care delivery and public health (T3), and health policy (T4). Advances on all of these fronts is increasingly dependent on making effective use of scientific data from multiple domains. The COVID-19 global emergency presents both an immediate challenge and an opportunity to progress on important data sharing aims emphasized by NIH. In response, NCATS and the Centers for Translational Science Award (CTSA) hubs, several HHS agencies, and other partnering organizations have committed to developing a next-generation repository for clinical data related to COVID-19, the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), as a means of accelerating global research into the disease and aiding the development of diagnostics, therapeutics, and effective vaccines. The N3C initiative's goal of improving the efficiency and accessibility of analyses with clinical data is consistent with the primary informatics objectives of Tufts CTSI, which am to reduce barriers to the integration of healthcare and research by providing innovative systems, data repositories, and analytical tools, and by enabling greater exchange and collaboration through interoperability, standardization, and resource sharing. In- line with shared objectives, in this supplement we seek to contribute to the N3C initiative as a data provider and thought partner through the following specific aims: (1) continue to play an important role providing tools and resources for N3C's analytics platform; and (2) ensure Tufts CTSI's Informatics Program has sufficient staff and technical resources to continue to provide COVID-specific patient data from our hub to the N3C repository. PROJECT NARRATIVE An integrated, continuously updated data repository and a platform of putting powerful analytics capabilities at the disposal of the scientific community can generate insights into COVID-19 and accelerate the development of effective treatments and vaccines to counter the disease.

"The University of Iowa Clinical and Translational Science Award ABSTRACT The Institute for Clinical and Translational Science (ICTS) at the University of Iowa (UI) was established by the Board of Regents to realize three objectives – first, to lead the development of translational science at the UI; second, to advance translational science as a distinct academic discipline; and third, to disseminate capacities in translational science across the State of Iowa. This mandate enabled us to tackle large problems affecting translational science that required institutional solutions, such as transforming regulatory processes for human subjects research, developing an informatics infrastructure for integrating electronic medical record and other health care data, establishing bi-directional relationships with community organizations, and revitalizing the pipeline of well trained clinical and translational researchers. Iowa is a rural state, which brings special health care needs and challenges. We have used these rural considerations as a catalyst for driving our approach to clinical and translational research pushing our teams to develop strategies to engage rural populations of all ages and backgrounds and to create new approaches that overcome the geographic barriers in a rural state. We are capitalizing on our established community practice networks of family physicians, clinics, school nurses and pharmacists. We utilize e Health/ e Learning platforms in novel ways and will test the efficacy of these new methods of engagement. As we move research “Beyond Our Borders,” we have created methods to capture real-time, real-life data from the home and to correlate this environmentally specific, comprehensive data to human performance. The ICTS is engaging with other CTSA hubs and national CTR systems to empirically test different approaches and to develop the evidence base of proven strategies for accelerating translation that can be more broadly disseminated. Though distance and rurality drive our approaches, the strategies that we develop are simply new and potentially better ways to generate broad representation and improved participation by patients, healthcare teams and academicians. Through our local, state and national partnerships, UI and the ICTS are poised to move clinical and translational discovery rapidly into healthcare practice in a variety of clinical settings. PROJECT NARRATIVE The mission of the University of Iowa Institute for Clinical and Translational Science (ICTS) is to accelerate translational science through programs to develop the translational workforce, promote the engagement of community members and other stakeholders, to promote research integration across the lifespan, and to catalyze innovative clinical and translational research. The ongoing development of collaborative data-based infrastructure and services is a central tenant to achieving this mission. The goals of this proposal are: for Iowa to join the N3C partnership, contributing data in an effective method that evolves and improves over time, to enable Iowa researchers to leverage the N3C data resource in their research and to leverage the N3C framework for other areas of research in the future.",The University of Iowa Clinical and Translational Science Award,10201104,UL1TR002537,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Award ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communities ', ' E-learning ', ' computer-assisted instruction ', ' computer-based education ', ' computer-based instruction ', ' computer-based learning ', ' computer-based training ', ' digital education ', ' digital learning ', ' eLearning ', ' electronic learning ', ' internet-assisted education ', ' internet-based training ', ' multimedia learning ', ' on-line education ', ' on-line learning ', ' online education ', ' online learning ', ' technology-enhanced learning ', ' virtual learning ', ' web-based instruction ', ' web-based training ', ' Data Sources ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Institutes ', ' Iowa ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Patient Participation ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacists ', ' Phenotype ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rural Health ', ' Rural Population ', ' School Nursing ', ' School Health Nursing ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Transfer Agreement ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Health Care Team ', ' Healthcare Team ', ' Medical Care Team ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' catalyst ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' Rural ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' Clinics or Hospitals ', ' Clinics and Hospitals ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' Genomics ', ' Health system ', ' Family Physicians ', ' Data ', ' Data Element ', ' Human Subject Research ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Community Practice ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Research ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pandemic ', ' pandemic disease ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' biomed informatics ', ' biomedical informatics ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' data acquisition ', ' community organizations ', ' Clinical and Translational Science Awards ', ' translational research center ', ' translational sciences center ', ' Center for Translational Science Activities ', ' evidence base ', ' efficacy testing ', ' data transfer ', ' data transmission ', ' data exchange ', ' data sharing ', ' IRB ', ' IRBs ', ' Institutional Review Boards ', ' support tools ', ' phenotypic data ', ' informatics infrastructure ', ' collaborative approach ', ' data resource ', ' rurality ', ' translational investigator ', ' translational researcher ', ' translational scientist ', ' health care management ', ' healthcare management ', ' health management ', ' clinical decision support ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databanks ', ' data depository ', ' data repository ', ' data warehouse ', ' Infrastructure ', ' COVID19 ', ' corona virus disease 2019 ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 ', ' COVID-19 ', ' sociodeterminant ', ' social determinants ', ' data enclave ', ' COVID ', ' CoV disease ', ' corona virus disease ', ' coronavirus disease ', ' ']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,UL1,2020,98933,IA-02,0.01686334522436148
"Integrative Biology Approach to Identify and Characterize Roles of lncRNAs Associated with Psoriasis Pathology PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Candidate After the completion of my Ph.D. in Bioinformatics, I joined the Center for Statistical Genetics at the University of Michigan (U-M) as research fellow and acquired extensive training in analysis on high- dimensional biological data. I uncovered a strong interest in studying the genetics and genomics of psoriasis when working with Dr. James Elder at the U-M, and I developed a fascination in understanding the functional roles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in cutaneous diseases. I joined the Department of Dermatology at the U-M as a faculty in summer of 2015, with secondary appointments in the Department of Computational Medicine & Bioinformatics and the Department of Biostatistics. In addition, I direct the new Center for Cutaneous Bioinformatics within the Department of Dermatology, and serve to supervise and implement an analysis pipeline for studies investigating the immunological mechanisms for different skin diseases. Career Development Plan I aim to become a future leader in combining in silico discovery and bench experiments to advance biomedical research in autoimmune skin disorders. My objective in seeking a Mentored Research Scientist Development Award is to acquire the additional knowledge, training, and experience necessary for me to become an independent scholar in developing novel systems biology approaches to decipher the pathology and mechanisms of cutaneous diseases. The five year training proposed will provide knowledge and experience in aspects that are critical to my success, and they are: i) To develop knowledge and experimental skills in cutaneous biology --- achieved by guidance from Dr. Elder (investigative dermatology), intense research meetings/conferences, and practical laboratory experience in cutaneous research; ii) To develop knowledge and skills to study immunological systems of autoimmune skin diseases --- achieved by supervision from Dr. Johann Gudjonsson (skin immunology), attending formal Immunology courses and seminars, and earning laboratory experience from immunology experiments; iii) To advance skills in developing statistical and computational approaches --- accomplished by mentoring from Dr. Goncalo Abecasis (computational biologist), research meetings, and conducting research projects requiring advanced skills and knowledge in quantitative science; iv) To cultivate my professional development through enhancing scientific connections, grantsmanship skills, and educator portfolio --- achieved by establishing connections with colleagues during meetings, visiting King’s College London as scholar, attending a grantsmanship workshop and bootcamp, and learning mentoring skills through teaching formal classes and mentoring research students. Through the intensive and comprehensive training, I will be well grounded in conducting basic science experiments and also be able to capitalize my advanced knowledge in quantitative science to model mechanisms in cutaneous diseases. Research Project The research project will use psoriasis as a disease model to study the roles of lncRNAs in complex cutaneous disorders. I will test the hypotheses that (i): some lncRNAs are key causal elements and potentiate pathogenic inflammatory reactions in psoriasis development and (ii) by combining in silico predictions and in vitro validations we are able to provide comprehensive characterization of skin-expressing lncRNAs in keratinocytes and lymphocytes to infer their pathological implications for psoriasis. This work will demonstrate how we can take advantages of the genomic data to develop an integrative biology framework to provide novel biological insights and understand pathological roles of lncRNAs. Significance Psoriasis is a chronic immune-mediated skin disease with complex genetic architecture. It is estimated that over 4 million Americans and 100 million people worldwide suffer from this disease. While genetic association studies have revealed the disease loci are highly enriched in non-coding regions, it is very challenging to translate genetic signals to biologic effects. In fact, most of the causal genes have not yet been identified. Our preliminary results showed that lncRNA is a class of gene that has largely been understudied for their roles in psoriasis, and both genetic and transcriptomic data suggested they can play important functions in psoriasis pathogenesis. By combining in silico analysis and in vitro validation we can expand our knowledge of lncRNAs in skin biology, and generate important hypotheses for future experiments. The results of this project can also identify novel biomarkers, and ultimately assist in the therapeutic drug discovery.

"In situ transcriptome profiling in single cells Summary We have recently developed intron seqFISH (sequential Fluorescence in situ hybridization) to multiplex 10,421 genes directly in single cells. We showed that the 10,421 gene nascent transcriptome profile can identify cell types as well as capture the trajectory of the cells. We further demonstrated that we can perform mRNA seqFISH as well as immunostaining in the same cells following the 10,421 gene intron seqFISH measurement. We propose to develop this technology as a potential alternative approach to single cell RNAseq for the HuBMAP to characterize cell types directly in situ in tissues. In particular, we will adept in situ amplification methods such as hybridization chain reaction (HCR) to intron seqFISH. We had previously shown that mRNA seqFISH with HCR amplification performs exceptionally in tissues in overcoming autofluorescence background and enable robust decoding seqFISH barcodes. We will validate the integrated intron and mRNA seqFISH protocol in the mouse hippocampus in the UG3 phase of the project. Also in UG3 phase, we will develop computational tools to integrate intron seqFISH data with mRNA seqFISH as well as single cell RNAseq data. In the UH3 phase, we will translate the technology to human tissues, with a focus on human mammary tissues provided by Dr. Seewaldt at City of Hope. We will also work with the tissue mapping centers in the HuBMAP program to accelerate the translation of this technology to many tissue types. In the UH3 phase, we will generate million cell spatial atlas of human tissues containing intron profiles, mRNA profiles and protein abundances in each single cell. We will further develop computational tools to analyze for spatial enrichment of genes in the tissue and generate a pseudotime of developmental trajectories using the nascent transcriptome data. Taken together, we will develop a high throughput in situ imaging based platform to characterize cell types and future trajectories of cells using intron and mRNA seqFISH technologies. Narrative Transcriptome profiling in situ at the single cell level has transformative potential for understanding healthy versus diseased tissues in the human body. We propose an integrative approach profiling the nascent transcriptome as well as hundreds of mature transcripts in single cells in tissues. We will generate million cell spatial atlas for the mouse hippocampus as well as the human mammary tissue. We will gain unprecedented insight into the developmental of neurons in the brain as well as the duct cells in the breast. At the same time we will develop the computational tools to analyze the spatial genomics data.",In situ transcriptome profiling in single cells,10026445,UH3CA255134,"['Algorithms ', ' Animals ', ' Atlases ', ' Bar Codes ', ' barcode ', ' Biology ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Breast ', ' Cell Differentiation process ', ' Cell Differentiation ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cities ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Epithelium ', ' Epithelium Part ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Introns ', ' Intervening Sequences ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Neuroglia ', ' Glia ', ' Glial Cells ', "" Kolliker's reticulum "", ' Neuroglial Cells ', ' Non-neuronal cell ', ' Nonneuronal cell ', ' nerve cement ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Play ', ' Proteins ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publishing ', ' Natural regeneration ', ' Regeneration ', ' regenerate ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Stains ', ' Staining method ', ' Standardization ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Immunofluorescence Immunologic ', ' Immunofluorescence ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Dentate Fascia ', ' Fascia Dentata ', ' Gyrus Dentatus ', ' dentate gyrus ', ' FISH Technic ', ' FISH Technique ', ' FISH analysis ', ' FISH assay ', ' Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization ', ' Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization ', ' base ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Phase ', ' Epithelial ', ' insight ', ' Measurement ', ' Human Figure ', ' Human body ', ' Letters ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' human tissue ', ' Radius ', ' Radial ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Reaction ', ' In Situ ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' granule cell ', ' breast epithelium ', ' mammary epithelium ', ' internal control ', ' Biopsy Sample ', ' Biopsy Specimen ', ' Speed ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' single molecule ', ' mammary ', ' Mammary gland ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' Data ', ' Ductal Cell ', ' Ductal Epithelial Cell ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epithelial-Stromal Interaction ', ' Epithelial-Stromal Communication ', ' Nuclear Structure ', ' Slice ', ' Transcript ', ' Validation ', ' Breast Tissue ', ' Mammary Gland Tissue ', ' Mammary Gland Parenchyma ', ' Process ', ' Fixation ', ' sample fixation ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' markov model ', ' scale up ', ' combinatorial ', ' imaging system ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' transcriptome ', ' Tissue imaging ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' genomic data ', ' in situ imaging ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' scRNA-seq ', ' single cell RNA-seq ', ' single cell RNAseq ', ' single-cell RNA sequencing ', ' HuBMAP ', ' Human BioMolecular Atlas Program ', ' ']",NCI,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,UH3,2020,400000,CA-27,-0.003954741377937296
"Genetic Privacy and Identity in Community Settings - GetPreCiSe Genetic Privacy and Identity in Community Settings (GetPreCiSe), is an NHGRI Center of Excellence in ELSI Research (CEER) that, in its first four years, established an environment for multi-disciplinary study that produced innovative ways of studying genetic privacy and identity. Specifically, the center 1) parsed the concept of genetic privacy into its often conflated constituent components, including: the “right to be let alone,” control and governance of data, and concerns about downstream uses of data; 2) documented and critically assessed the privacy practices of direct to consumer genetic testing (DTC-GT) companies; 3) examined how and why people trade off personal privacy for other social goods and services; 4) used new techniques to explore how film, television, and social media reflect and affect public perceptions of genetic privacy; and 5) refined understanding of the risk that people will be re-identified from their genomic information. During this time, many developments raised new issues of privacy and identity for genetics. First is the growth of DTC-GT, which generates genetic information used to trace ancestry, acquire health information, find relatives, uncover parentage, and pursue law enforcement investigations, among other activities. Second, laws and regulations governing data privacy and security, particularly with respect to genomics, are changing rapidly in the U.S. and abroad. These often conflict and present new challenges as genomic data move across state and international borders. Third, the creation of ever larger cohorts, such as the NIH’s All of Us Research Program, raises further dilemmas because some or all of the genomic and other data participants provide will be made available to investigators working in a variety of settings and subject to different regulatory regimes. Moreover, participants in these studies may receive research results, which could be deposited in their electronic health records, making this data subject to clinical regulation and compelling action by clinical providers who may not have the knowledge or infrastructure to respond. Thus, as our understanding of genomics increases, so, too, do its multifarious roles and implications for individuals, families, and society evolve. Given the evolving landscape, in its next four years GetPreCiSe will address three complementary specific aims: 1) Apply multimodal methods to characterize how social practices affect, and are affected by, evolving notions of genetic privacy and identity and increased availability of data, 2) Characterize how emerging legal and regulatory frameworks influence genomic privacy and identity in the US and abroad, and 3) Engineer and evaluate new technologies and quantitative frameworks that have potential to intrude on, but also protect, genetic privacy and identity. Recognizing that genetic data processing opportunities and threats are evolving, GetPreCiSe is designed to be a multi-disciplinary center, focused on training the next generation of ELSI researchers, with sufficient agility to respond to emerging issues. We anticipate these aims will need to be refined, and possibly pivoted, over the next four years and so stand ready to seed new investigations into emerging issues and compose new teams for investigation as needed. The incorporation of genetics and genomics into medical care and the public domain raises new challenges for how we understand privacy and identity, concepts that have long been closely linked in American discourse. The Genetic Privacy and Identity in Community Settings (GetPreCiSe), an NHGRI Center of Excellence in Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications Research (CEER) will 1) characterize how social practices and genetic data access affect notions of genetic privacy and identity, 2) assess the impact of emerging laws and regulatory frameworks in the US and abroad, and 3) gauge how new technologies compromise but also uphold protections.",Genetic Privacy and Identity in Community Settings - GetPreCiSe,9982627,RM1HG009034,"['Advertising ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Arts ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Behavior ', ' California ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communities ', ' Conceptions ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Data Collection ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' European Union ', ' European Community ', ' Family ', ' Genetic Identity ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health ', ' Imagination ', ' Laws ', ' Literature ', ' Methods ', ' Genetic Models ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Newspapers ', ' Perception ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Seeds ', ' Plant Embryos ', ' Plant Zygotes ', ' seed ', ' Social Sciences ', ' Societies ', ' Technology ', ' Television ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Privacy ', ' Data Protection ', ' Data awareness ', ' information security ', ' Data Security ', ' Film ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' Law Enforcement ', ' Public Domains ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Internet ', ' news ', ' Genetic ', ' Deposit ', ' Deposition ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' cohort ', ' Participant ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' social ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' behavioral influence ', ' behavior influence ', ' Genomics ', ' Genetic Privacy ', ' Provider ', ' data processing ', ' computerized data processing ', ' Legal ', ' Radio ', ' ACT2 ', ' AT744.1 ', ' Act-2 ', ' CCL4 ', ' Chemokine (C-C Motif) Ligand 4 ', ' Chemokine, CC Motif, Ligand 4 ', ' Immune Activation 2 ', ' MIP1B ', ' MIP1B1 ', ' Macrophage Inflammatory Protein 1-Beta ', ' SCYA4 ', ' Small Inducible Cytokine A4 ', ' CCL4 gene ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Use of New Techniques ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' NHGRI ', ' National Center for Human Genome Research ', ' National Human Genome Research Institute ', ' ethical, legal, and social ', ' ethical legal social implication ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' next generation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' multi-modality ', ' multimodality ', ' community setting ', ' minimal risk ', ' legal implication ', ' data sharing ', ' BigData ', ' Big Data ', ' genetic information ', ' behavioral economics ', ' Genetic study ', ' social media ', ' data access ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' genomic data ', ' All of Us Program ', ' All of Us Research Project ', ' AoURP ', ' All of Us Research Program ', ' Infrastructure ', ' block chain ', ' blockchain ', ' data privacy ', ' gene testing ', ' gene-based testing ', ' genetic testing ', ' ']",NHGRI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,RM1,2020,1112351,TN-05,-0.028226481762550975
