"Pattern analysis of large-scale functional connectivity to predict implicit emoti The current proposal is aimed at developing a novel neurobiological marker based on patterns of whole-brain functional connectivity during implicit and subliminal threat-related facial emotion perception to aid the diagnosis and assessment of treatment response in social anxiety (SAD) and panic disorder (PD). The following Specific Aims are proposed:    Specific Aim 1). Develop, apply and validate an approach to estimate the large-scale functional networks of implicit and subliminal threat-related and ambiguous facial emotion processing in a healthy control subject pool.    We will perform this by first testing whether large-scale partial correlations measured during a particular condition (i.e. presentation of visible or invisible fearful and neutral faces) can be used as features to predict the stimulus type presented during the condition (Sub-aim 1a). We will then test whether the most informative features for predicting fearful vs. neutral face conditions are connections among primarily limbic and paralimbic nodes, and that the most informative features in predicting neutral vs. resting states conditions are connections among primarily attention, motor and sensory related regions (Sub-aim 1b).    Specific Aim 2). Determine whether the approach developed in SA1 may have potential clinical application towards the diagnosis and treatment of SAD and PD.    We will perform this by testing whether the above functional networks are informative brain signatures that can be used to discriminate between healthy controls, SAD and PD subjects (Sub-aim 2a). We will also test whether the approach can be used to determine the particular sub-networks that are aberrant in SAD and PD (Sub-aim 2b). PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed approach may contribute toward the development of effective biomarkers in the diagnosis of SAD and PD. It may also identify the functional connections whose patterns differ between control and SAD, control and PD, and SAD and PD. This would contribute to our understanding of and aid in the development of therapies for these distinct anxiety disorders.",Pattern analysis of large-scale functional connectivity to predict implicit emoti,8089245,F31MH088104,"['disorder control ', ' disease control ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' treatment response ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Emotions ', ' Manuals ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdala ', ' Weight ', ' Learning ', ' Brain Stem ', ' Brainstem ', ' Accounting ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Testing ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Emotional ', ' Measures ', ' Complex ', ' Motor ', ' biomarker ', ' Training ', ' Cognitive ', ' Stimulus ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Maps ', ' base ', ' Pattern ', ' social ', ' novel ', ' Attention ', ' Affect ', ' Rest ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' improved ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' Process ', ' Brain region ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Anxiety ', ' Decision Making ', ' Sensory ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Perception ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hippocampus ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Population Control ', ' Social Controls ', ' showing emotion ', ' expression of emotion ', ' emotional expression ', ' Pattern Recognition ', ' Atlases ', ' Panic Disorder ', ' panic anxiety syndrome ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' ']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,F31,2011,37400,NY-13,0.30550827006481224
"Analytic Methods for Determining Multimodal Biomarkers for Parkinson's Disease     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There has been considerable progress in understanding the biology of Parkinson's disease (PD). Reliable biomarkers are still lacking, however, for early stage detection of PD and for characterizing disease progression. Advances in biotechnology have led to the advent of mental health studies that collect large-scale, multi-dimensional data sets, including brain imaging data, genomic data, and biologic and clinical measures. Such studies provide an unprecedented opportunity for cross-cutting investigations that stand to gain a deeper understanding of PD. A major limiting factor to multidimensional biomarker development, however, is the lack of statistical tools available to accommodate diverse, large-scale data. Leveraging data from neuromelanin magnetic resonance imaging (NM-MRI) of the locus coeruleus and the substantia nigra, chemical shift imaging (CSI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), resting-state functional MRI, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analytes, genotype information, and numerous clinical variables, we plan to develop novel statistical techniques to identify multimodal PD biomarkers. Our data provide an unprecedented opportunity for cross-cutting methodological advances in multimodal PD biomarker discovery. Separately, we will consider a massive patient database with nearly 250,000 subscribers in Georgia. Building on our collective expertise in developing statistical and machine-learning methods for large-scale imaging data and in the pathophysiology of PD, we plan to advance methods for PD biomarker analyses and discovery through the following specific aims. First, we plan to develop new statistical techniques to reveal multimodal biomarkers for PD including imaging, clinical, and biologic variables. Secondly, we plan to utilize the massive clinical database to identify clinical risk factors for early stage PD. Thirdly, we will develop software equipped with a friendly graphical user interface (GUI) to implement the multimodal biomarker detection methods.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There is a critical unmet need for the discovery of early-stage Parkinson's disease (PD) biomarkers to assist and accelerate the process for conducting clinical trials targeting neuroprotective treatments. Large studies with clinical, molecular, genetic, and neuroimaging measures produce complex multidimensional datasets, which may be useful to help establish such biomarkers. We plan to develop new statistical methods that integrate multiple high-dimensional data sets to identify accurate and robust multimodal biomarkers of PD.                  There is a critical unmet need for the discovery of early-stage Parkinson's disease (PD) biomarkers to assist and accelerate the process for conducting clinical trials targeting neuroprotective treatments.

"FUNCTIONAL BRAIN NETWORK DEVELOPMENT IN EARLY CHILDHOOD DEPRESSION     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neuroimaging studies of depression have suggested aberrant brain network relationships in this disorder. Despite these compelling findings there have been very few investigations examining the developmental timing of these alterations in children experiencing the earliest known form of depression, Preschool Depression (PD). The purpose of this mentored Patient-Oriented Career Development Award (K23) is to provide the applicant with the skills and experience necessary to begin filling this knowledge gap. The unique mentorship and training opportunities available to the applicant complement his strong background in clinical psychology and research with clinical populations. The applicant's long-term goal is to develop an independent programmatic line of research investigating the developmental neurobiology of depression. To facilitate this goal, instruction and mentoring are proposed in 1) applying a systematic approach to the study of functional brain network development in PD using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) 2) methods for studying the relationships between brain networks and behavior in PD and 3) methods for studying the convergence between network organization and task based fMRI activity in PD. An expert interdisciplinary team of mentors and consultants will support the proposed research and training plan. The feasibility of the proposed award is enhanced by the availability of a large set of fMRI data from an ongoing longitudinal neuroimaging study of school age children with a history of PD and their same age healthy peers (NIMH MH090786) as well as a high level of success in obtaining pilot fMRI data from healthy and depressed preschoolers (4-6 years old). Using these samples, a systematic approach investigating functional brain networks at the level of individual brain regions or region pairs, targeted subnetworks, and whole brain networks (using graph theory methods) is planned for aim 1. As a second aim, the behavioral correlates associated with group differences identified in aim 1 will be examined. Patterns of overlap between group differences in brain network organization and fMRI task-based activity during an emotion face-viewing paradigm (collected in the same individuals) will be the focus of a planned exploratory aim. It is hypothesized that 1) PD will be associated with disrupted Default Mode Network connectivity 2) atypical network organization will be related to depression severity and emotion regulation difficulties in PD and 3) a high level of overlap between network and task based group differences will be present. The study of brain networks in PD may reveal unique and early occurring neurobiological markers of risk for continued mood difficulties and/or later depression; information potentially critical for developing novel preventative treatments aimed at minimizing depression's public health burden. The complimentary training and research plans proposed in this application will facilitate the applicant's transition into an independent researc career addressing NIMH research priorities that emphasize discoveries in the brain and behavioral sciences (Strategic Plan) and the study of brain networks in psychopathology (RDoC).!        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The training and research goals outlined in the current application will enable the candidate to become an independent researcher in the field of translational developmental neuroscience, with unique expertise that could significantly increase our developmental understanding of brain networks in depression and how they go awry in this impairing disorder.

"Intrinsic Cortical Networks and Cognitive Dysfunction in Parkinson???s Disease  7. Project Summary/Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) affects 1% of adults over age 65. While traditionally defined by motor symptoms, up to 75% of PD patients will eventually develop dementia making it the leading cause of nursing home placement in this population. Although there is currently no cure for PD, our ability to treat motor symptoms has advanced tremendously since the 1960's based on advances in our understanding of motor symptom neurophysiology. I propose that the treatment and prevention of dementia in PD may also prove possible through advances in our understanding of the neurophysiology of cognitive dysfunction. I will use modern network theory as a theoretical and mathematical framework for this endeavor. My long-term goal is to advance our fundamental understanding of the neurophysiology of cognitive dysfunction in PD to provide empirically testable models, clinically relevant biomarkers, and novel therapeutic targets. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that patterns of cortical functional connectivity critical to normal cognitive function are disrupted by subcortical pathology in PD and that interventions which normalize these patterns will improve cognition. This hypothesis has been formulated on the basis of preliminary data presented in this proposal and other previously published work. The research objectives of this proposal are to further our understanding of how cortical connectivity relates to cognitive dysfunction in PD, develop a novel biomarker for cognitive dysfunction in PD based on cortical physiology and to determine whether modulation of cortical connectivity may result in cognitive improvements in PD. We will accomplish the objectives of this proposal through three Specific Aims: 1) Determine whether graph theory measures of functional cortical activity measured with magnetoencephalography (MEG) are associated with cognitive dysfunction in PD subjects with and without mild cognitive impairment (MCI); 2) Develop a novel state-defining biomarker for cognitive dysfunction in PD based on MEG features through a machine learning approach; and 3) Determine the effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on MEG measures of cortical connectivity and cognitive outcomes in PD-MCI patients. The approach is innovative because it represents the first study to apply graph theory measures to understanding the relationship of cortical physiology and cognitive dysfunction in PD; the first study to apply machine learning approaches to cognitive PD biomarker development; and the first clinical trial or mechanistic study of rTMS in PD-MCI. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to advance our understanding of the pathophysiology of cognitive dysfunction in PD and will provide biomarkers and pilot data essential to planning future therapeutic interventions. The training objectives and related research activities of this proposal will provide new skills, manuscripts and pilot data related to advanced MEG analysis, graph theory, biomarker development and rTMS trials necessary to establish my independence in these areas and obtain R01 funding to advance this unique research program.

"FUNCTIONAL BRAIN NETWORK DEVELOPMENT IN EARLY CHILDHOOD DEPRESSION     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neuroimaging studies of depression have suggested aberrant brain network relationships in this disorder. Despite these compelling findings there have been very few investigations examining the developmental timing of these alterations in children experiencing the earliest known form of depression, Preschool Depression (PD). The purpose of this mentored Patient-Oriented Career Development Award (K23) is to provide the applicant with the skills and experience necessary to begin filling this knowledge gap. The unique mentorship and training opportunities available to the applicant complement his strong background in clinical psychology and research with clinical populations. The applicant's long-term goal is to develop an independent programmatic line of research investigating the developmental neurobiology of depression. To facilitate this goal, instruction and mentoring are proposed in 1) applying a systematic approach to the study of functional brain network development in PD using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) 2) methods for studying the relationships between brain networks and behavior in PD and 3) methods for studying the convergence between network organization and task based fMRI activity in PD. An expert interdisciplinary team of mentors and consultants will support the proposed research and training plan. The feasibility of the proposed award is enhanced by the availability of a large set of fMRI data from an ongoing longitudinal neuroimaging study of school age children with a history of PD and their same age healthy peers (NIMH MH090786) as well as a high level of success in obtaining pilot fMRI data from healthy and depressed preschoolers (4-6 years old). Using these samples, a systematic approach investigating functional brain networks at the level of individual brain regions or region pairs, targeted subnetworks, and whole brain networks (using graph theory methods) is planned for aim 1. As a second aim, the behavioral correlates associated with group differences identified in aim 1 will be examined. Patterns of overlap between group differences in brain network organization and fMRI task-based activity during an emotion face-viewing paradigm (collected in the same individuals) will be the focus of a planned exploratory aim. It is hypothesized that 1) PD will be associated with disrupted Default Mode Network connectivity 2) atypical network organization will be related to depression severity and emotion regulation difficulties in PD and 3) a high level of overlap between network and task based group differences will be present. The study of brain networks in PD may reveal unique and early occurring neurobiological markers of risk for continued mood difficulties and/or later depression; information potentially critical for developing novel preventative treatments aimed at minimizing depression's public health burden. The complimentary training and research plans proposed in this application will facilitate the applicant's transition into an independent researc career addressing NIMH research priorities that emphasize discoveries in the brain and behavioral sciences (Strategic Plan) and the study of brain networks in psychopathology (RDoC).!          The training and research goals outlined in the current application will enable the candidate to become an independent researcher in the field of translational developmental neuroscience, with unique expertise that could significantly increase our developmental understanding of brain networks in depression and how they go awry in this impairing disorder. Despite growing recognition of depression as a 'network illness', there have been very few studies examining functional brain network organization in children with very early occurring depression. Such studies could lead to the earlier identification of children who will later develop MDD and inform new preventive treatment efforts aimed at minimizing the significant burden of this important public health issue. Thus, the proposed award addresses important federal research priorities aimed at reducing the impact of depression on public health.

"Intrinsic Cortical Networks and Cognitive Dysfunction in Parkinson???s Disease     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Parkinson's disease (PD) affects 1% of adults over age 65. While traditionally defined by motor symptoms, up to 75% of PD patients will eventually develop dementia making it the leading cause of nursing home placement in this population. Although there is currently no cure for PD, our ability to treat motor symptoms has advanced tremendously since the 1960's based on advances in our understanding of motor symptom neurophysiology. I propose that the treatment and prevention of dementia in PD may also prove possible through advances in our understanding of the neurophysiology of cognitive dysfunction. I will use modern network theory as a theoretical and mathematical framework for this endeavor. My long-term goal is to advance our fundamental understanding of the neurophysiology of cognitive dysfunction in PD to provide empirically testable models, clinically relevant biomarkers, and novel therapeutic targets. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that patterns of cortical functional connectivity critical to normal cognitive function are disruptd by subcortical pathology in PD and that interventions which normalize these patterns will improve cognition. This hypothesis has been formulated on the basis of preliminary data presented in this proposal and other previously published work. The research objectives of this proposal are to further our understanding of how cortical connectivity relates to cognitive dysfunction in PD, develop a novel biomarker for cognitive dysfunction in PD based on cortical physiology and to determine whether modulation of cortical connectivity may result in cognitive improvements in PD. We will accomplish the objectives of this proposal through three Specific Aims: 1) Determine whether graph theory measures of functional cortical activity measured with magneto encephalography (MEG) are associated with cognitive dysfunction in PD subjects with and without mild cognitive impairment (MCI); 2) Develop a novel state-defining biomarker for cognitive dysfunction in PD based on MEG features through a machine learning approach; and 3) Determine the effects of repetitive trans cranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on MEG measures of cortical connectivity and cognitive outcomes in PD-MCI patients. The approach is innovative because it represents the first study to apply graph theory measures to understanding the relationship of cortical physiology and cognitive dysfunction in PD; the first study to apply machine learning approaches to cognitive PD biomarker development; and the first clinical trial or mechanistic study of rTMS in PD-MCI. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to advance our understanding of the pathophysiology of cognitive dysfunction in PD and will provide biomarkers and pilot data essential to planning future therapeutic interventions. The training objectives and related research activities of this proposal will provide new skills, manuscripts and pilot data related to advanced MEG analysis, graph theory, biomarker development and rTMS trials necessary to establish my independence in these areas and obtain R01 funding to advance this unique research program.

Despite these compelling findings there have been very few investigations examining the developmental timing of these alterations in children experiencing the earliest known form of depression, Preschool Depression (PD). The purpose of this mentored Patient-Oriented Career Development Award (K23) is to provide the applicant with the skills and experience necessary to begin filling this knowledge gap. The unique mentorship and training opportunities available to the applicant complement his strong background in clinical psychology and research with clinical populations. The applicant's long-term goal is to develop an independent programmatic line of research investigating the developmental neurobiology of depression. To facilitate this goal, instruction and mentoring are proposed in 1) applying a systematic approach to the study of functional brain network development in PD using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) 2) methods for studying the relationships between brain networks and behavior in PD and 3) methods for studying the convergence between network organization and task based fMRI activity in PD. An expert interdisciplinary team of mentors and consultants will support the proposed research and training plan. The feasibility of the proposed award is enhanced by the availability of a large set of fMRI data from an ongoing longitudinal neuroimaging study of school age children with a history of PD and their same age healthy peers (NIMH MH090786) as well as a high level of success in obtaining pilot fMRI data from healthy and depressed preschoolers (4-6 years old). Using these samples, a systematic approach investigating functional brain networks at the level of individual brain regions or region pairs, targeted subnetworks, and whole brain networks (using graph theory methods) is planned for aim 1. As a second aim, the behavioral correlates associated with group differences identified in aim 1 will be examined. Patterns of overlap between group differences in brain network organization and fMRI task-based activity during an emotion face-viewing paradigm (collected in the same individuals) will be the focus of a planned exploratory aim. It is hypothesized that 1) PD will be associated with disrupted Default Mode Network connectivity 2) atypical network organization will be related to depression severity and emotion regulation difficulties in PD and 3) a high level of overlap between network and task based group differences will be present. The study of brain networks in PD may reveal unique and early occurring neurobiological markers of risk for continued mood difficulties and/or later depression; information potentially critical for developing novel preventative treatments aimed at minimizing depression's public health burden. The complimentary training and research plans proposed in this application will facilitate the applicant's transition into an independent researc career addressing NIMH research priorities that emphasize discoveries in the brain and behavioral sciences (Strategic Plan) and the study of brain networks in psychopathology (RDoC). The training and research goals outlined in the current application will enable the candidate to become an independent researcher in the field of translational developmental neuroscience, with unique expertise that could significantly increase our developmental understanding of brain networks in depression and how they go awry in this impairing disorder. Despite growing recognition of depression as a 'network illness', there have been very few studies examining functional brain network organization in children with very early occurring depression. Such studies could lead to the earlier identification of children who will later develop MDD and inform new preventive treatment efforts aimed at minimizing the significant burden of this important public health issue. Thus, the proposed award addresses important federal research priorities aimed at reducing the impact of depression on public health.",FUNCTIONAL BRAIN NETWORK DEVELOPMENT IN EARLY CHILDHOOD DEPRESSION,8880280,K23MH098176,"['novel ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' peer ', ' Pattern ', ' Graph ', ' Techniques ', ' National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.) ', ' Neurobiology ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Universities ', ' base ', ' career ', ' skills ', ' neuroimaging ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Measures ', ' Methods ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Moods ', ' Movement ', ' Time ', ' Specificity ', ' Crying ', ' Training Activity ', ' Training Programs ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Complement ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Disease ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Cetacort ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cortef ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortril ', ' Dermacort ', ' Eldecort ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Hytone ', ' Nutracort ', ' Pregn-4-ene-3,20-dione, 11,17,21-trihydroxy-, (11beta)- ', ' Proctocort ', ' Therapeutic Hydrocortisone ', ' Work ', ' Rest ', ' Child ', ' Risk ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Nursery Schools ', ' Seeds ', ' Brain ', ' Research ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' neurobiological ', ' History ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' Washington ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Goals ', ' Physiology ', ' Clinical Psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Age ', ' Award ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Instruction ', ' preschool ', ' Plant Embryos ', ' Plant Zygotes ', ' seed ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' Researchers ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' body movement ', ' Adult ', ' Data ', ' Doctor of Medicine ', ' Preventive ', ' Symptoms ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Human ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Development ', ' treatment response ', ' Emotions ', ' Data Set ', ' Encephalon ', ' Risk Marker ', ' innovation ', ' 6 year old ', ' Address ', ' Impairment ', ' clinically significant ', ' brain behavior ', ' patient oriented ', ' cognitive control ', ' emotion regulation ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' age 6 years ', ' six year old ', ' developmental ', ' adolescent depression ', ' childhood depression ', ' pediatric depression ', ' Collection ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Training ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' child depression ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' adulthood ', ' Population ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' K-Awards ', ' Research Career Program ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Neural Networks (Computer) ', ' Perceptrons ', ' neural network (computer simulation of nervous system) ', ' major depression ', ' M.D. ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Ethical Issues ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Curriculum ', ' depression ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Disorder ', ' disease/disorder ', ' school age ', ' Dataset ', ' clinical significance ', ' Postdoc ', ' Research Associate ', ' post-doc ', ' post-doctoral ', ' patient centered ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' Brain region ', ' School-Age Population ', ' Research Activity ', ' Investigation ', ' Sampling ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' Severities ', ' Individual ', ' Machine Learning ', ' theories ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Research Priority ', ' Complex ', ' case control ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scanning ', ' Depressed mood ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' early childhood ', ' Funding ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Variation ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' Fellowship ', ' Face ', ' Emotional ', ' developmental neurobiology ', ' early experience ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' experience ', ' Dorsal ', ' interest ', ' Area ', ' Training ', ' Exposure to ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' tool ', ' success ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' Early identification ', ' fMRI ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Public Health ', ' depressed ', ' sadness ', ' kernel methods ', ' statistical learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' Functional MRI ', ' ']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K23,2015,131037,MO-01,0.21215507449789284
"Metabolomics and risk of Parkinson's Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the United States and affects over one million Americans; this number is growing due to population aging. Current treatments do not prevent the disease progression that ultimately results in severe disability. There is thus a compelling need to develop neuroprotective treatments. Because at the time of the clinical diagnosis of PD there is already substantial neuronal loss, such treatments should ideally be initiated earlier. Aims of the proposed investigation are to implement and validate a novel metabolomic approach for the identification of early changes in peripheral blood of individuals with preclinical or premotor PD. The metabolomic results will be integrated with detailed and validated information on risk factors for PD, which has been collected prospectively and periodically updated. We expect by this means to identify new clues to the etiology of PD and to identify a metabolomic signature of PD that could contribute to an early diagnosis. To achieve these goals, we will take advantage of data and blood samples collected from over 80,000 participants in three large ongoing cohorts, the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), the Health Professional Follow-up Study (HPFS), and the Cancer Prevention Study-II Nutrition, who have been followed for over 25 years for incident Parkinson disease.

"Intrinsic Cortical Networks and Cognitive Dysfunction in Parkinson's Disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Parkinson's disease (PD) affects 1% of adults over age 65. While traditionally defined by motor symptoms, up to 75% of PD patients will eventually develop dementia making it the leading cause of nursing home placement in this population. Although there is currently no cure for PD, our ability to treat motor symptoms has advanced tremendously since the 1960's based on advances in our understanding of motor symptom neurophysiology. I propose that the treatment and prevention of dementia in PD may also prove possible through advances in our understanding of the neurophysiology of cognitive dysfunction. I will use modern network theory as a theoretical and mathematical framework for this endeavor. My long-term goal is to advance our fundamental understanding of the neurophysiology of cognitive dysfunction in PD to provide empirically testable models, clinically relevant biomarkers, and novel therapeutic targets. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that patterns of cortical functional connectivity critical to normal cognitive function are disruptd by subcortical pathology in PD and that interventions which normalize these patterns will improve cognition. This hypothesis has been formulated on the basis of preliminary data presented in this proposal and other previously published work. The research objectives of this proposal are to further our understanding of how cortical connectivity relates to cognitive dysfunction in PD, develop a novel biomarker for cognitive dysfunction in PD based on cortical physiology and to determine whether modulation of cortical connectivity may result in cognitive improvements in PD. We will accomplish the objectives of this proposal through three Specific Aims: 1) Determine whether graph theory measures of functional cortical activity measured with magneto encephalography (MEG) are associated with cognitive dysfunction in PD subjects with and without mild cognitive impairment (MCI); 2) Develop a novel state-defining biomarker for cognitive dysfunction in PD based on MEG features through a machine learning approach; and 3) Determine the effects of repetitive trans cranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on MEG measures of cortical connectivity and cognitive outcomes in PD-MCI patients. The approach is innovative because it represents the first study to apply graph theory measures to understanding the relationship of cortical physiology and cognitive dysfunction in PD; the first study to apply machine learning approaches to cognitive PD biomarker development; and the first clinical trial or mechanistic study of rTMS in PD-MCI. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to advance our understanding of the pathophysiology of cognitive dysfunction in PD and will provide biomarkers and pilot data essential to planning future therapeutic interventions. The training objectives and related research activities of this proposal will provide new skills, manuscripts and pilot data related to advanced MEG analysis, graph theory, biomarker development and rTMS trials necessary to establish my independence in these areas and obtain R01 funding to advance this unique research program. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Dementia is the leading cause of nursing home placement in Parkinson's disease (PD) yet little is known about the cause(s) of cognitive dysfunction in PD and there are no effective treatments. Our preliminary data and other published studies suggest that abnormalities in brain activity involving networks important for normal thinking and memory may contribute to cognitive dysfunction in PD and may represent a target for treatment. This proposal will identify abnormalities in cortical activity related to cognitive dysfunction in PD usng magneto encephalography and will perform a randomized control trial of frontal repetitive trans cranial magnetic stimulation to determine the therapeutic potential of modulating this brain activity.",Intrinsic Cortical Networks and Cognitive Dysfunction in Parkinson's Disease,8853346,K02NS080885,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cognition ', ' Double-Masked Study ', ' Double-Masked Method ', ' Double-Blinded ', ' Double-Blind Study ', ' Double-Blind Method ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Magnetoencephalography ', ' Memory ', ' Mentors ', ' Motor Cortex ', ' neurophysiological ', ' neurophysiology ', ' nursing home ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Parkinsons disease ', "" Parkinson's disease "", "" Parkinson's "", ' Parkinson ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Lewy Body Parkinson Disease ', ' Idiopathic Parkinson Disease ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Physiology ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Testing ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Thinking, function ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Cranial ', ' Cephalic ', ' Area ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' encephalography ', ' Research Activity ', ' Funding ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Therapeutic ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' cognitive function ', ' Transcranial magnetic stimulation ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Pattern ', ' Test Result ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' neurodegenerative illness ', ' degenerative neurological diseases ', ' degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons ', ' Neurologic Degenerative Conditions ', ' Neurodegenerative Diseases ', ' Neuro-degenerative Disorders ', ' Neural degenerative Disorders ', ' Neural Degenerative Diseases ', ' Nervous System Degenerative Diseases ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Disorders ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Diseases ', ' Neurodegenerative Disorders ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' magnetic ', ' Magnetism ', ' Manuscripts ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Graph ', ' Prevention ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' cognitive change ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' physiologic model ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' therapeutic target ', ' neurobiological mechanism ', ' high risk ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' screening ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,K02,2015,186354,CO-06,0.3803561271168486

"Characterizing Intrinsic Functional Cortical Networks in Parkinson Disease Dementia ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Parkinson's disease (PD) affects 1% of adults over age 65. While traditionally defined by motor symptoms, up to 75% of PD patients will eventually develop PD-related dementia (PDD) making it the leading cause of nursing home placement in PD. Although there is currently no cure for PD, our ability to treat motor symptoms has advanced tremendously since the 1960's based on advances in our understanding of motor symptom neurophysiology. We propose that the treatment and prevention PDD may also prove possible by advancing our understanding of the neurophysiology underlying cognitive dysfunction. We will use modern network theory as a theoretical and mathematical framework for this endeavor. The long- term goal is to advance our understanding of the neurophysiology underlying cognitive dysfunction in PD to provide empirically testable models, clinically relevant biomarkers, and novel therapeutic targets. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that patterns of functional connectivity critical to normal cognition are disrupted by subcortical pathology in PDD. This hypothesis was formulated on the basis of our own preliminary data and other recent research. We will accomplish the objectives of this proposal through three Specific Aims: 1) Determine whether graph theory measures of network functional connectivity are associated with cognitive phenotypes in PD based on either a) the severity of cognitive dysfunction; or b) specific cognitive domains affected; 2) Develop a novel state-defining biomarker for PDD based on measures of intrinsic network functional activity using a machine learning approach; and 3) Explore the potential role of subcortical sources on cortical network activity and cognition using dynamic causal modeling (DCM). These Aims are achievable within a two-year timeframe as they will involve analyses of a single data set of resting MEG data from 25 control subjects, 25 PDD subjects, 25 PD subjects with normal cognition and 25 PD subjects with mild cognitive impairment. The feasibility of this proposal is aided by leveraging a currently funded NINDS K02 Independent Scientist Award (1 K02 NS080885-01A1). Data and biomarkers generated by this R21 Exploratory/Developmental Research Grant will provide a foundation for future studies to validate state- defining and predictive biomarkers; mechanistic studies on the role of acetylcholine and dopamine in cognition; and therapeutic studies of physiologic or pharmacologic interventions targeting physiological and regional abnormalities. The approach is innovative as the first study to apply graph theory measures to understanding the relationship of cortical physiology and cognitive dysfunction across cognitive domains and severity levels in PD; the first study to apply machine learning approaches to PDD biomarker development; and the first use of DCM to model cortical and subcortical contributions to PDD.

"Neural and Kinematic Features of Freezing of Gait for Adaptive Neurostimulation PROJECT SUMMARY Freezing of gait (FOG) in Parkinson’s disease (PD) results in unpredictable episodes of gait cessation, which may lead to falls, injury, a loss of independent living, and even death19. The treatment of FOG is inconsistent with either dopaminergic medication or with current open loop, continuous high frequency deep brain stimulation (cDBS)15, 25. Emerging technology using non-continuous, closed loop or adaptive DBS (aDBS), has the potential to improve treatment for FOG. Adaptive DBS can sense patient specific neural and/or kinematic signals and respond by adjusting DBS parameters to provide more efficacious therapy while reducing adverse side effects known to occur with cDBS. The critical barriers of using aDBS for FOG are the lack of knowledge of: the neural features of FOG that could be ‘sensed’ by aDBS to trigger stimulation, the optimal, patient specific DBS parameters for the treatment of FOG, and whether aDBS for FOG is safe and tolerable in human PD patients. In the Bronte-Stewart Lab, we have the technology, the regulatory approvals and the research experience collecting synchronized neural and quantitative kinematic signals, applying different DBS parameters for FOG, performing the first aDBS experiments in freely moving PD subjects. The Bronte-Stewart Lab was the first group and Stanford was the first site in the United States to implant a sensing neurostimulator for PD, the Activa® PC+S (Medtronic Inc., FDA IDE/Stanford IRB approval, October 2013). This comprised the FDA approved neurostimulator (Activa PC®, Medtronic Inc.) with additional software that enabled recording of brain signals via telemetry from the neurostimulator itself. We have implanted twenty PD patients (largest cohort in the world), from whom we have been collecting synchronized neural and computerized kinematic signals for over thirty months without adverse events. We will use this new technology in conjunction with our expertise in quantitative kinematics and validated measure of FOG to begin understanding the neural features associated with FOG. In addition, we will use quantitative measures of FOG to accurately determine the efficacy of patient specific stimulation parameters for effective and consistent treatment of FOG. No center has had the technological capability to test the safety and feasibility of aDBS for FOG in freely moving PD patients. Whether patients can tolerate aDBS, which continually adjusts output to control a time-varying patient-specific neural signal as they are walking and moving freely is completely unknown and will be assessed in a pilot study in this proposal. This project is expected to signal the beginning of a new era of precise medicine: the possibility to treat FOG in PD in a customized, adaptive manner, while minimizing adverse effects and complementing the treatment of other disabling motor features of PD such as tremor. PROJECT NARRATIVE Freezing of gait (FOG), a severe complication of Parkinson’s disease that could result in falls and even death, is not consistently well treated with current one-size fits all continuous deep brain stimulation therapy. Newly available adaptive DBS (aDBS) provides an opportunity to improve treatment of FOG by delivering precise medicine; real-time patient specific stimulation that is driven by patient specific neural signals. The goals of this project are to perform an in-depth analysis of the synchronized neural and kinematic data of freely moving patients, while stimulating with various settings to (1) better define these poorly understood patient specific signals and effective stimulation settings, and (2) to perform a pilot study to determine the safety and feasibility of whether patients can tolerate aDBS which continually adjusts the stimulation output.",Neural and Kinematic Features of Freezing of Gait for Adaptive Neurostimulation,9244090,R21NS096398,"['Algorithms ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Complication ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Electrodes ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Freezing ', ' Gait ', ' Goals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Independent Living ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Medicine ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Parkinsons disease ', "" Parkinson's disease "", "" Parkinson's "", ' Parkinson ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Patients ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Safety ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Technology ', ' Telemetries ', ' Telemetry ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tremor ', ' United States ', ' Measures ', ' Walking ', ' falls ', ' Structure of subthalamic nucleus ', ' Subthalamic Nucleus ', ' Nucleus Subthalamicus ', ' human subject ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Dorsal ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Nexus Junction ', ' Nexus ', ' Low-resistance Junction ', ' Communicating Junction ', ' Gap Junctions ', ' Bradykinesia ', ' Measurement ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Deep Brain Stimulation ', ' Frequencies ', ' Side ', ' Location ', ' experience ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neural regulation ', ' neural control ', ' neuroregulation ', ' cohort ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' kinematic model ', ' kinematics ', ' neuronal signaling ', ' neural signaling ', ' nerve signaling ', ' glial signaling ', ' glia signaling ', ' axonal signaling ', ' axon-glial signaling ', ' axon signaling ', ' Neuronal Transmission ', ' Nerve Transmission ', ' Nerve Impulse Transmission ', ' neurotransmission ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Adverse effects ', ' patient safety ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Collection ', ' Emergent Technologies ', ' Emerging Technologies ', ' wireless ', ' Wireless Technology ', ' Output ', ' computerized ', ' Outcome ', ' Coupling ', ' Implant ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' FDA approved ', ' standard care ', ' standard treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' safety testing ', ' comparative efficacy ', ' compare efficacy ', ' Institutional Review Boards ', ' IRBs ', ' place fields ', ' Fall injury ', ' ']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R21,2016,235500,CA-18,0.24505750831287584

Adaptive DBS can sense patient specific neural and/or kinematic signals and respond by adjusting DBS parameters to provide more efficacious therapy while reducing adverse side effects known to occur with cDBS. The critical barriers of using aDBS for FOG are the lack of knowledge of: the neural features of FOG that could be ‘sensed’ by aDBS to trigger stimulation, the optimal, patient specific DBS parameters for the treatment of FOG, and whether aDBS for FOG is safe and tolerable in human PD patients. In the Bronte-Stewart Lab, we have the technology, the regulatory approvals and the research experience collecting synchronized neural and quantitative kinematic signals, applying different DBS parameters for FOG, performing the first aDBS experiments in freely moving PD subjects. The Bronte-Stewart Lab was the first group and Stanford was the first site in the United States to implant a sensing neurostimulator for PD, the Activa® PC+S (Medtronic Inc., FDA IDE/Stanford IRB approval, October 2013). This comprised the FDA approved neurostimulator (Activa PC®, Medtronic Inc.) with additional software that enabled recording of brain signals via telemetry from the neurostimulator itself. We have implanted twenty PD patients (largest cohort in the world), from whom we have been collecting synchronized neural and computerized kinematic signals for over thirty months without adverse events. We will use this new technology in conjunction with our expertise in quantitative kinematics and validated measure of FOG to begin understanding the neural features associated with FOG. In addition, we will use quantitative measures of FOG to accurately determine the efficacy of patient specific stimulation parameters for effective and consistent treatment of FOG. No center has had the technological capability to test the safety and feasibility of aDBS for FOG in freely moving PD patients. Whether patients can tolerate aDBS, which continually adjusts output to control a time-varying patient-specific neural signal as they are walking and moving freely is completely unknown and will be assessed in a pilot study in this proposal. This project is expected to signal the beginning of a new era of precise medicine: the possibility to treat FOG in PD in a customized, adaptive manner, while minimizing adverse effects and complementing the treatment of other disabling motor features of PD such as tremor. PROJECT NARRATIVE Freezing of gait (FOG), a severe complication of Parkinson’s disease that could result in falls and even death, is not consistently well treated with current one-size fits all continuous deep brain stimulation therapy. Newly available adaptive DBS (aDBS) provides an opportunity to improve treatment of FOG by delivering precise medicine; real-time patient specific stimulation that is driven by patient specific neural signals. The goals of this project are to perform an in-depth analysis of the synchronized neural and kinematic data of freely moving patients, while stimulating with various settings to (1) better define these poorly understood patient specific signals and effective stimulation settings, and (2) to perform a pilot study to determine the safety and feasibility of whether patients can tolerate aDBS which continually adjusts the stimulation output.",Neural and Kinematic Features of Freezing of Gait for Adaptive Neurostimulation,9360002,R21NS096398,"['Algorithms ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Complication ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Electrodes ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Freezing ', ' Gait ', ' Goals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Independent Living ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Medicine ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Parkinsons disease ', "" Parkinson's disease "", "" Parkinson's "", ' Parkinson ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Safety ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Technology ', ' Telemetry ', ' Telemetries ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tremor ', ' United States ', ' Measures ', ' Walking ', ' falls ', ' Subthalamic Nucleus ', ' Nucleus Subthalamicus ', ' Structure of subthalamic nucleus ', ' Custom ', ' human subject ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Dorsal ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Nexus Junction ', ' Nexus ', ' Low-resistance Junction ', ' Communicating Junction ', ' Gap Junctions ', ' motor dysfunction ', ' motor disease ', ' motor disorder ', ' Bradykinesia ', ' Measurement ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Deep Brain Stimulation ', ' Investigation ', ' Frequencies ', ' Side ', ' Location ', ' experience ', ' neuroregulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neural regulation ', ' neural control ', ' cohort ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' kinematics ', ' kinematic model ', ' neurotransmission ', ' neuronal signaling ', ' neural signaling ', ' nerve signaling ', ' glial signaling ', ' glia signaling ', ' axonal signaling ', ' axon-glial signaling ', ' axon signaling ', ' Neuronal Transmission ', ' Nerve Transmission ', ' Nerve Impulse Transmission ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' Adverse event ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse effects ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' patient safety ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Collection ', ' Emergent Technologies ', ' Emerging Technologies ', ' wireless ', ' Wireless Technology ', ' Output ', ' computerized ', ' Outcome ', ' Coupling ', ' Implant ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' FDA approved ', ' standard care ', ' standard treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' safety testing ', ' comparative efficacy ', ' compare efficacy ', ' place fields ', ' Fall injury ', ' safety and feasibility ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' ']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R21,2017,196250,CA-18,0.24505750831287584

"Mid-frontal delta/theta rhythms and cognitive control in PD Abstract Up to 80% of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) will suffer from cognitive symptoms, including impaired attention, planning, reasoning and working memory as well as hallucinations, visuospatial dysfunction, and delusions. These impairments lead to mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) and dementia (PDD) in PD. Cognitive symptoms of PD are associated with enormous cost to our society. There are no clear biomarkers and few effective treatments for PD-MCI/PDD. Because risk for PD increases dramatically with age, this problem will surge as our population grows older. The mechanisms contributing to PD-MCI/PDD are unknown. Our group has found that low-frequency (1-8 Hz; or delta/theta bands) brain rhythms might be helpful in diagnosing cognitive dysfunction in PD. This delta/theta activity originates from areas of medial frontal cortex such as the anterior cingulate, and is detectable by mid-frontal scalp EEG electrodes. We have found that mid-frontal delta/theta brain rhythms are engaged when healthy individuals detect novelty, errors, and conflict, or make decisions. These rhythms are attenuated in PD patients. Our working model is that PD patients manifest diverse neuronal and network deficits that impair mid-frontal delta/theta activity, leading to failures in engaging cognitive control. These abnormalities contribute to PD-MCI and PDD. In this proposal we combine `big-data' machine learning tools, intraoperative neurophysiology in humans, and new brain-stimulation paradigms to investigate the role of mid-frontal delta/theta rhythms in PD. We will test the overall hypothesis that mid-frontal delta/theta impairments are a mechanism of cognitive dysfunction in PD. In Aim 1 we will determine if mid-frontal delta/theta activity predicts PD-MCI/PDD. In Aim 2 we will use unique intraoperative recordings to determine how delta/theta activity within medial frontal cortex influences neurons in the subthalamic nucleus, a key site of functional convergence that is targeted by current deep-brain stimulation for PD. Notably, the subthalamic nucleus is a compact structure that receives highly overlapping input from cognitive and motor cortical regions, making it likely that our recordings will capture cognitive processing within this nucleus. Finally, in Aim 3 we will determine if subthalamic nucleus deep-brain stimulation at delta/theta frequencies improves cognitive control in PD patients. Because these experiments involve recordings across several PD patient populations (Aim 1), from single subthalamic neurons (Aim 2), and brain stimulation (Aim 3), each of these aims will provide independent mechanistic insight into cognitive dysfunction in PD. PD is a complex disease, but if cortical EEG abnormalities are a consistent theme it might inspire new diagnostic tools or new brain-stimulation therapies for cognitive dysfunction in PD. Results from this proposal could also be important for other neurodegenerative diseases such as dementia with Lewy bodies and Alzheimer's disease.     Public Health Relevance Cognitive symptoms of Parkinson's disease are an enormous public health problem. Here, we will ana- lyze brain rhythms that are involved in cognitive processing and also dysfunctional in Parkinson's dis- ease. We will use these brain rhythms to guide novel brain stimulation that has the potential to treat dementia and cognitive impairments in Parkinson's disease.  ",Mid-frontal delta/theta rhythms and

"Reinforcement Learning for Closed-Loop Deep Brain Stimulation ABSTRACT Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, affecting 1 in 100 people over the age of 60, and more than 5 million people worldwide. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has emerged as an effective treatment for the motor signs of PD. However, DBS is often limited by partial efficacy, side effects, and long and difficult clinical visits to identify and program therapeutic stimulation settings. Additionally, PD symptoms fluctuate from moment-to-moment depending on a multitude of factors, and therefore the demand for stimulation (or medication) changes throughout the day. There is a clear need for automated, individualized DBS programming strategies that can both reduce programming time and adapt to deliver optimal stimuli as each patient's symptoms fluctuate. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to improve the quality of life for PD patients by providing them with an intelligent, adaptive, closed-loop DBS algorithm. In Aim 1, we propose to create a closed-loop DBS algorithm in silico that can learn from and adapt to electro-physiological signatures of parkinsonian states in order to deliver optimal, patient- specific stimulation. The algorithm will be built upon the framework of reinforcement learning, which has several desirable properties that make it ideally suited for use in a closed-loop DBS algorithm. Given a biomarker for parkinsonian severity and a set of possible actions, the algorithm will autonomously learn how to deliver stimulus to reduce the biomarker and therefore PD symptoms. Preliminary results shown in this proposal suggest that the algorithm is able to learn complex actions without a priori knowledge, and can help to control a selected biomarker. In Aim 2, we propose to test out the algorithm in a large animal model of PD with high-density DBS arrays that have been shown to enable more advanced current steering and higher resolution local field potential recordings. We will then apply the algorithm and compare its performance to continuous DBS in terms of effects on individual parkinsonian motor signs as well as the electrophysiological signal targeted by the algorithm. This project will not only provide a means to critically evaluate putative biomarkers of DBS therapy for alleviating parkinsonian motor signs, but also provide a much more versatile and powerful closed-loop algorithm for use in titrating DBS therapy for individuals with Parkinson's disease and other neurological disorders amenable to deep brain stimulation therapy. As a result of this project, we will create a closed-loop DBS algorithm that can help improve the quality of life for Parkinson's disease patients. NARRATIVE Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects 1 in 100 people over the age of 60, and while dopamine replacement medication is well established for alleviating many of the motor symptoms of PD, but deep brain stimulation (DBS) is often indicated, in conjunction with medication as the disease progresses. One of the significant challenges with DBS is patient-specific dosimetry of stimulation settings to efficiently achieve a strong and consistent therapeutic effect. This project will develop an innovative reinforcement learning algorithm that autonomously learns which stimulation settings are most effective at reducing parkinsonian motor signs based on closed-loop feedback of oscillatory activity within the subthalamic nucleus and globus pallidus using high-density electrode arrays.",Reinforcement Learning for Closed-Loop Deep Brain Stimulation,9638443,F31NS103487,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Attention ', ' Basal Ganglia ', ' Basal Nuclei ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Decision Making ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Dopamine ', ' Hydroxytyramine ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Electrodes ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Environment ', ' Feedback ', ' Globus Pallidus ', ' pallidum ', ' Goals ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Macaca mulatta ', ' Rhesus Monkey ', ' Rhesus Macaque ', ' Rhesus ', ' Moods ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurons ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Neurotoxins ', ' neurotoxicant ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Parkinsons disease ', "" Parkinson's disease "", "" Parkinson's "", ' Parkinson ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Patients ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Rewards ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Sleep ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' Work ', ' falls ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Blinded ', ' Subthalamic Nucleus ', ' Nucleus Subthalamicus ', ' Structure of subthalamic nucleus ', ' Titrations ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Refractory ', ' Phase ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Training ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' non-human primate ', ' nonhuman primate ', ' Parkinsonism ', ' Parkinsonian Syndrome ', ' Parkinsonian Diseases ', ' Parkinsonian Condition ', ' Parkinsonian ', ' Parkinsonian Disorders ', ' Disease Progression ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Pulse ', ' Deep Brain Stimulation ', ' Investigation ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' Neurodegenerative Disorders ', ' neurodegenerative illness ', ' degenerative neurological diseases ', ' degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons ', ' Neurologic Degenerative Conditions ', ' Neurodegenerative Diseases ', ' Neural degenerative Disorders ', ' Neural Degenerative Diseases ', ' Nervous System Degenerative Diseases ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Disorders ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Diseases ', ' Visit ', ' Performance ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' dosimetry ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' Adverse effects ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Motor ', ' Resolution ', ' therapeutic outcome ', ' therapy outcome ', ' investigator training ', ' Process ', ' Therapeutic Effect ', ' Behavioral ', ' Coupling ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Implant ', ' deep brain stimulation array ', ' computational network modeling ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' neuronal patterning ', ' individual patient ', ' motor symptom ', ' clinical translation ', ' deep reinforcement learning ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,F31,2018,30197,MN-05,0.22532935157187878
"Development of brain-computer interface methods to influence brain dynamics in stuttering Project summary Brain dynamics that drive variability within and between patients are an important, but poorly understood, element of many cognitive disorders. The long-term goal of this research project is to develop technology that will identify brain activity patterns associated with successful performance on a given task, and use this pattern as a target for brain-computer interface (BCI) training. The overarching hypothesis is that using BCI training to more often have a brain state that is spontaneously correlated to good performance will, in turn, improve overall performance. This approach could be developed into a powerful tool for rehabilitation and therapy for many neurological and psychiatric disorders. Here we will investigate persistent developmental stuttering (PDS) as a model to study brain dynamics associated with successful vs. unsuccessful performance. PDS is a speech disorder where fluent speech is punctuated to various degrees by stuttering. Individuals with PDS are otherwise neurologically in the normal range, which avoids complicating factors in most patient populations. Stuttering is intermittent; thus on some occasions the brain is in a state conducive to fluent speech and at other times it is not. We propose to use EEG activity shortly before speaking to predict whether somebody with PDS will stutter or speak fluently. Preliminary data are given to show proof of concept with traditional EEG analysis methods. This approach will be expanded by first using advanced methods such as common spatial pattern analysis and machine learning over multiple subject sessions to identify EEG signals that distinguish fluent vs. dysfluent trials (Aim 1). PDS subjects will then be trained to produce and maintain their EEG pattern that is most strongly associated with fluent speech by using BCI methods. We hypothesize that individuals will learn to modulate EEG features to be more consistent with fluent trials, which in turn will significantly reduce stuttering rate. After successful completion of this project we envision a new BCI-based intervention that can be used to encourage neural states conducive to fluent speech in those who stutter. The BCI intervention would complement traditional speech therapy using behavioral methods. The “two-step approach” of first identifying brain states associated with a patient’s best performance followed by BCI training to enter that state more often can be applied to rehabilitation in many other neurological and psychiatric disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease, traumatic brain injury, and mood disorders, to name a few. Project narrative The goal of this project is to develop brain-computer interface technology to optimize brain function on an individual basis.

"DaTscan-based Disease Progression Models for Early-stage Parkinson’s Disease Project Summary Parkinson's disease (PD) is heterogeneous: it has many subtypes and the disease progresses at different rates in different subtypes. Disease progression in early-stage PD is observed as signal changes in SPECT imaging with 123I-FP-CIT, which is called DaTscan imaging, or simply DaTscan. The goal of the research proposed here is to create accurate models of heterogeneous PD progression using DaTscan images. Such models will not only provide additional insight into PD, but they are also critically important in assessing the effect of neuro-protective therapy. A new set of models called mixtures of linear dynamical systems (MLDS) are proposed to model early-state PD progression as it manifests in DaTscans. MLDS models combine machine-learning methods with linear dynamical system theory. They capture many features of early-stage PD progression: laterality, non-linear progression, as well as PD heterogeneity. Preliminary results show that, MLDS is accurate, finds progression subtypes, relates well to clinical data (MDS-UPDRS motor scores), and gives genuinely new insights about PD progression. The proposed research aims to develop the MLDS methodology in region-of-interest as well as voxel-based frameworks. A detailed discussion of the MLDS theory, model fitting, and the relation to clinical data is included. Longitudinal DaTscan images as well as MDS-UPDRS motor scores are available for over 440 subjects from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI), and this data set will be used along with MLDS to create the PD progression models. Project Narrative How Parkinson's disease (PD) progresses is poorly understood. This research proposes to develop precise disease progression models for PD using machine-learning. These models will give greater insight into PD progression and also help assess PD therapy.",DaTscan-based Disease Progression Models for Early-stage Parkinson’s Disease,9574626,R01NS107328,"['Algorithms ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' striatal ', ' Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Exhibits ', ' Globus Pallidus ', ' pallidum ', ' Goals ', ' Joints ', ' Handedness ', ' Laterality ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Biological Models ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Parkinsons disease ', "" Parkinson's disease "", "" Parkinson's "", ' Parkinson ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' putamen ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Systems Theory ', ' single photon emission computed tomography ', ' Single-Photon Emission-Computed Radionuclide Tomography ', ' SPECT imaging ', ' SPECT ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' dopamine transporter ', ' DAT dopamine transporter ', ' Glean ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Left ', ' Anterior ', ' Clinical ', ' insight ', ' Bilateral ', ' Disease Progression ', ' uptake ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Pattern ', ' interest ', ' neuron loss ', ' neuronal loss ', ' neuronal death ', ' neuronal cell loss ', ' neuronal cell death ', ' neuron death ', ' neuron cell loss ', ' neuron cell death ', ' nerve cell loss ', ' nerve cell death ', ' expectation ', ' Modeling ', ' model design ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Clinical Data ', ' clinical test ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' research clinical testing ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke ', ' NINDS ', ' National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke ', ' Coupled ', ' Coupling ', ' presynaptic ', ' progression marker ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' dynamical system ', ' dynamic system ', ' disease heterogeneity ', ' ']",NINDS,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,345666,CT-03,0.34990765003534413
"MRI Signatures of Neuromelanin and Iron Pathology in Parkinsonism Parkinson’s disease (PD), multiple system atrophy parkinsonian type (MSA-P), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) are costly and devastating neurodegenerative diseases. They have overlapping clinical manifestations and diagnosis remains challenging in many cases. Thus far no effective treatments have been developed to meaningfully slow or stop their progression. This is due in part to a lack of tools to objectively measure degeneration in the neural systems affected by each of these diseases. Availability of such tools would assist clinical diagnosis, facilitate selection of appropriate patient groups for trial recruitment, and enable objective measurement of treatment outcomes. Recent MRI studies suggest that disease-specific brain changes can, indeed, be identified in these parkinsonian diseases. The objective of this research is to identify univariable markers and multivariable MRI signatures that capture distinct patterns of neurodegenerative change across neural systems to accurately distinguish these diseases.  To accomplish this the investigators use 3 Tesla MRI contrasts sensitive to key features of neurodegeneration to 1) identify structures damaged by PD, MSA-P and PSP and 2) to quantify the extent of damage in each neural system in parkinsonian diseases. Specifically, the investigators use neuromelanin- sensitive MRI to measure neuromelanin loss and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) and R2* imaging to measure iron accumulation in patients with PD, MSA-P, and PSP. Using these contrasts and an innovative region of interest (ROI) selection approach, they reproducibly measure patterns of neurodegenerative change across neural systems. In Aim 1 the investigators use neuromelanin-sensitive MRI to study neuromelanin loss in PD, MSA-P and PSP in to identify univariable disease features that are differentially affected by parkinsonian diseases and may assist distinguishing these conditions. In Aim 2 they use QSM and R2* MRI to study ROIs differentially impacted by PD, MSA-P and PSP to identify iron accumulation biomarkers to help distinguish these diseases. In Aim 3 the investigators apply machine learning classification algorithms to identify multivariable MRI signatures of neurodegenerative change across neural systems to differentiate PD, MSA-P and PSP. Study outputs will be candidate MRI biomarkers and disease signatures. The long term goal of this research is to further develop these outputs for use as clinical diagnostic tools and as biomarkers for subject selection and outcome measurement in clinical trials.  Through this career award Dr. Huddleston will gain new skills in MRI methods, data science, and neural systems imaging in parkinsonian diseases. These new skills will enable Dr. Huddleston to design and lead interdisciplinary neuroimaging biomarker studies for Parkinson’s disease and related disorders. His mentor team is comprised of leaders in their fields. This team and the dynamic research environment at Emory University provide the necessary support for Dr. Huddleston to successfully transition to scientific independence. There is an urgent public health need for new treatments to slow or stop the progression of Parkinson’s disease, multiple system atrophy and progressive supranuclear palsy, and objective tools to distinguish these diseases for clinical and research purposes are lacking. The outputs of the proposed research will be candidate MRI biomarkers and multivariable MRI signatures to differentiate these conditions. These candidate biomarkers may be developed for use in clinical trial designs to increase their odds of success, and they may also assist clinical diagnosis.",MRI Signatures of Neuromelanin and Iron

"The Gut Microbiome in Parkinson Disease Project Summary/Abstract This is a first R01 application from an early stage, new investigator and current NIEHS K01 awardee. Parkinson disease (PD) is a disabling neurodegenerative disease for which there is no cure. Years before the diagnosis of PD and the onset of motor symptoms, PD patients develop non-motor symptoms, including, importantly, constipation and gastrointestinal dysfunction. Constipation affects over 80% of PD patients and is one of the strongest risk factors for PD. Recent research shows that the enteric nervous system in the gut and the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve which anatomically links the GI system to the brain, are among the first and most severely affected by alpha-synuclein pathology characteristic of PD5 leading to the hypothesis that the gastrointestinal tract might be the site of initiation of PD. We propose to conduct a comprehensive investigation of the relation between human gut microbiome and PD, focusing on the pre- onset microbiome. We will do this by building on an ongoing Department of Defense funded project that has identified participants with pre-parkinson syndrome (PPS - defined as the co- occurrence of constipation, pRBD (probable rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder) and hyposmia) that in a pilot study has been associated with a ~200 fold increase in PD risk. Studying the microbiome among this group, who are highly likely to develop PD or are already in the premotor state, will give us a unique look at the microbiome in PD patients prior to any potential disease-associated effects of changes in diet and lifestyle that may have confounded prior case-control studies. The proposed study will take advantage of 25 years of prospectively collected data on environmental and dietary exposures and disease outcomes in two prospective cohorts of men and women. Project Narrative Our appreciation of the impact of the gut microbiome on brain health, and especially PD, is in the early stages. This study will be the first to examine the gut microbiome in participants with premotor PD and compare it to healthy controls, controls with constipation and to recently onset PD cases. This project will thus advance our understanding of how the human gut microbiome contributes to the pathophysiology of PD and will contribute to the development of tools needed for a preclinical

"Mid-frontal delta/theta rhythms and cognitive control in PD Abstract Up to 80% of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) will suffer from cognitive symptoms, including impaired attention, planning, reasoning and working memory as well as hallucinations, visuospatial dysfunction, and delusions. These impairments lead to mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) and dementia (PDD) in PD. Cognitive symptoms of PD are associated with enormous cost to our society. There are no clear biomarkers and few effective treatments for PD-MCI/PDD. Because risk for PD increases dramatically with age, this problem will surge as our population grows older. The mechanisms contributing to PD-MCI/PDD are unknown. Our group has found that low-frequency (1-8 Hz; or delta/theta bands) brain rhythms might be helpful in diagnosing cognitive dysfunction in PD. This delta/theta activity originates from areas of medial frontal cortex such as the anterior cingulate, and is detectable by mid-frontal scalp EEG electrodes. We have found that mid-frontal delta/theta brain rhythms are engaged when healthy individuals detect novelty, errors, and conflict, or make decisions. These rhythms are attenuated in PD patients. Our working model is that PD patients manifest diverse neuronal and network deficits that impair mid-frontal delta/theta activity, leading to failures in engaging cognitive control. These abnormalities contribute to PD-MCI and PDD. In this proposal we combine `big-data' machine learning tools, intraoperative neurophysiology in humans, and new brain-stimulation paradigms to investigate the role of mid-frontal delta/theta rhythms in PD. We will test the overall hypothesis that mid-frontal delta/theta impairments are a mechanism of cognitive dysfunction in PD. In Aim 1 we will determine if mid-frontal delta/theta activity predicts PD-MCI/PDD. In Aim 2 we will use unique intraoperative recordings to determine how delta/theta activity within medial frontal cortex influences neurons in the subthalamic nucleus, a key site of functional convergence that is targeted by current deep-brain stimulation for PD. Notably, the subthalamic nucleus is a compact structure that receives highly overlapping input from cognitive and motor cortical regions, making it likely that our recordings will capture cognitive processing within this nucleus. Finally, in Aim 3 we will determine if subthalamic nucleus deep-brain stimulation at delta/theta frequencies improves cognitive control in PD patients. Because these experiments involve recordings across several PD patient populations (Aim 1), from single subthalamic neurons (Aim 2), and brain stimulation (Aim 3), each of these aims will provide independent mechanistic insight into cognitive dysfunction in PD. PD is a complex disease, but if cortical EEG abnormalities are a consistent theme it might inspire new diagnostic tools or new brain-stimulation therapies for cognitive dysfunction in PD. Results from this proposal could also be important for other neurodegenerative diseases such as dementia with Lewy bodies and Alzheimer's disease.     Public Health Relevance Cognitive symptoms of Parkinson's disease are an enormous public health problem. Here, we will ana- lyze brain rhythms that are involved in cognitive processing and also dysfunctional in Parkinson's dis- ease. We will use these brain rhythms to guide novel brain stimulation that has the potential to treat dementia and cognitive impairments in Parkinson's disease.  ",Mid-frontal delta/theta rhythms and

"Development of brain-computer interface methods to influence brain dynamics in stuttering Project summary Brain dynamics that drive variability within and between patients are an important, but poorly understood, element of many cognitive disorders. The long-term goal of this research project is to develop technology that will identify brain activity patterns associated with successful performance on a given task, and use this pattern as a target for brain-computer interface (BCI) training. The overarching hypothesis is that using BCI training to more often have a brain state that is spontaneously correlated to good performance will, in turn, improve overall performance. This approach could be developed into a powerful tool for rehabilitation and therapy for many neurological and psychiatric disorders. Here we will investigate persistent developmental stuttering (PDS) as a model to study brain dynamics associated with successful vs. unsuccessful performance. PDS is a speech disorder where fluent speech is punctuated to various degrees by stuttering. Individuals with PDS are otherwise neurologically in the normal range, which avoids complicating factors in most patient populations. Stuttering is intermittent; thus on some occasions the brain is in a state conducive to fluent speech and at other times it is not. We propose to use EEG activity shortly before speaking to predict whether somebody with PDS will stutter or speak fluently. Preliminary data are given to show proof of concept with traditional EEG analysis methods. This approach will be expanded by first using advanced methods such as common spatial pattern analysis and machine learning over multiple subject sessions to identify EEG signals that distinguish fluent vs. dysfluent trials (Aim 1). PDS subjects will then be trained to produce and maintain their EEG pattern that is most strongly associated with fluent speech by using BCI methods. We hypothesize that individuals will learn to modulate EEG features to be more consistent with fluent trials, which in turn will significantly reduce stuttering rate. After successful completion of this project we envision a new BCI-based intervention that can be used to encourage neural states conducive to fluent speech in those who stutter.

The “two-step approach” of first identifying brain states associated with a patient’s best performance followed by BCI training to enter that state more often can be applied to rehabilitation in many other neurological and psychiatric disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease, traumatic brain injury, and mood disorders, to name a few.

"MRI Signatures of Neuromelanin and Iron Pathology in Parkinsonism Parkinson’s disease (PD), multiple system atrophy parkinsonian type (MSA-P), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) are costly and devastating neurodegenerative diseases. They have overlapping clinical manifestations and diagnosis remains challenging in many cases. Thus far no effective treatments have been developed to meaningfully slow or stop their progression. This is due in part to a lack of tools to objectively measure degeneration in the neural systems affected by each of these diseases. Availability of such tools would assist clinical diagnosis, facilitate selection of appropriate patient groups for trial recruitment, and enable objective measurement of treatment outcomes. Recent MRI studies suggest that disease-specific brain changes can, indeed, be identified in these parkinsonian diseases. The objective of this research is to identify univariable markers and multivariable MRI signatures that capture distinct patterns of neurodegenerative change across neural systems to accurately distinguish these diseases.  To accomplish this the investigators use 3 Tesla MRI contrasts sensitive to key features of neurodegeneration to 1) identify structures damaged by PD, MSA-P and PSP and 2) to quantify the extent of damage in each neural system in parkinsonian diseases. Specifically, the investigators use neuromelanin- sensitive MRI to measure neuromelanin loss and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) and R2* imaging to measure iron accumulation in patients with PD, MSA-P, and PSP. Using these contrasts and an innovative region of interest (ROI) selection approach, they reproducibly measure patterns of neurodegenerative change across neural systems. In Aim 1 the investigators use neuromelanin-sensitive MRI to study neuromelanin loss in PD, MSA-P and PSP in to identify univariable disease features that are differentially affected by parkinsonian diseases and may assist distinguishing these conditions. In Aim 2 they use QSM and R2* MRI to study ROIs differentially impacted by PD, MSA-P and PSP to identify iron accumulation biomarkers to help distinguish these diseases. In Aim 3 the investigators apply machine learning classification algorithms to identify multivariable MRI signatures of neurodegenerative change across neural systems to differentiate PD, MSA-P and PSP. Study outputs will be candidate MRI biomarkers and disease signatures. The long term goal of this research is to further develop these outputs for use as clinical diagnostic tools and as biomarkers for subject selection and outcome measurement in clinical trials.  Through this career award Dr. Huddleston will gain new skills in MRI methods, data science, and neural systems imaging in parkinsonian diseases. These new skills will enable Dr. Huddleston to design and lead interdisciplinary neuroimaging biomarker studies for Parkinson’s disease and related disorders. His mentor team is comprised of leaders in their fields. This team and the dynamic research environment at Emory University provide the necessary support for Dr. Huddleston to successfully transition to scientific independence. There is an urgent public health need for new treatments to slow or stop the progression of Parkinson’s disease, multiple system atrophy and progressive supranuclear palsy, and objective tools to distinguish these diseases for clinical and research purposes are lacking. The outputs of the proposed research will be candidate MRI biomarkers and multivariable MRI signatures to differentiate these conditions. These candidate biomarkers may be developed for use in clinical trial designs to increase their odds of success, and they may also assist clinical diagnosis.",MRI Signatures of Neuromelanin and Iron

"CRCNS: Deep Neural Network Approaches for Closed-Loop Deep Brain Stimulation The discovery that aberrant synchronization of rhythmic neuronal activity recorded in PD patients is suppressed by DBS has advanced the concept that measures associated with pathological activity may be used as biomarkers to control the delivery of DBS therapy. Pilot studies of aDBS in PD have reported promising clinical results from triggering DBS stimulation when the signal recorded from the DBS electrode showed a high level of oscillatory power in the beta frequency range (13 – 35 Hz). That approach, however, has important limitations. Most importantly, beta power recorded from the DBS lead is suppressed by movement including PD tremor, its detection is highly dependent on lead location and the recording montage needed to record during stimulation is incompatible with directional current steering, a recent innovation employing segmented stimulation contacts. The inherent complexity of the increased parameter space through DBS innovations also overwhelms standard programming techniques. Finally, use of additional biomarker signals (e.g., recorded from cortex) is likely to improve the ability to adaptively control DBS for disorders marked by complex multidimensional symptomatologies such as PD. The current proposal will establish methods for overcoming these limitations by developing techniques for multi-feature classification from ECoG recordings, using advanced machine learning algorithms. The proposed research builds upon the extensive and unique experiences with multi-day, extra-operative recording from DBS leads in patients at Charité Hospital and intraoperative ECoG and DBS recording from patients at the University of Pittsburgh, in order to develop computational methods to advance closed-loop, adaptive DBS (aDBS) strategies for movement disorders. This research seeks to improve computational methods for interpreting brain signals recorded from patients undergoing deep brain stimulation for Parkinson’s disease. The results may inform the design of novel strategies for biomarker-responsive brain stimulation.",CRCNS: Deep Neural Network Approaches for Closed-Loop Deep Brain Stimulation,10021999,R01NS110424,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Basal Ganglia ', ' Basal Nuclei ', ' Behavior ', ' Berlin ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' Data Collection ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Electrodes ', ' Environment ', ' epileptogenic ', ' epileptiform ', ' epilepsia ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' Epileptics ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Evolution ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Hospitals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Intelligence ', ' Joints ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Maps ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' body movement ', ' Movement ', ' Movement Disorder Syndromes ', ' Dyskinesia Syndromes ', ' Movement Disorders ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' Neurosciences ', ' neurosurgery ', ' Noise ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Parkinsons disease ', "" Parkinson's disease "", "" Parkinson's "", ' Parkinson ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Patients ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Periodicity ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' Research ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tremor ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' Bradykinesia ', ' Parkinsonian Disorders ', ' Parkinsonism ', ' Parkinsonian Syndrome ', ' Parkinsonian Diseases ', ' Parkinsonian Condition ', ' Parkinsonian ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Deep Brain Stimulation ', ' Investigation ', ' Electrocorticogram ', ' electrocorticography ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' 3D ', ' 3-D ', ' Location ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Brain region ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Motor ', ' Validation ', ' Pathologic ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' reconstruction ', ' computer framework ', ' computational framework ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' Implant ', ' implantation ', ' remote sensor ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' translational neuroscience ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' symptomatology ', ' reduce symptoms ', ' symptom relief ', ' symptom reduction ', ' symptom alleviation ', ' relieves symptoms ', ' fewer symptoms ', ' decrease symptom ', ' ameliorating symptom ', ' alleviate symptom ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' artificial neural network ', ' synthetic neural network ', ' computational neural network ', ' artificial neural net ', ' deep learning ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' ']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2019,228673,MA-08,0.17477911422624745

"DaTscan-based Disease Progression Models for Early-stage Parkinson’s Disease Project Summary Parkinson's disease (PD) is heterogeneous: it has many subtypes and the disease progresses at different rates in different subtypes. Disease progression in early-stage PD is observed as signal changes in SPECT imaging with 123I-FP-CIT, which is called DaTscan imaging, or simply DaTscan. The goal of the research proposed here is to create accurate models of heterogeneous PD progression using DaTscan images. Such models will not only provide additional insight into PD, but they are also critically important in assessing the effect of neuro-protective therapy. A new set of models called mixtures of linear dynamical systems (MLDS) are proposed to model early-state PD progression as it manifests in DaTscans. MLDS models combine machine-learning methods with linear dynamical system theory. They capture many features of early-stage PD progression: laterality, non-linear progression, as well as PD heterogeneity. Preliminary results show that, MLDS is accurate, finds progression subtypes, relates well to clinical data (MDS-UPDRS motor scores), and gives genuinely new insights about PD progression. The proposed research aims to develop the MLDS methodology in region-of-interest as well as voxel-based frameworks. A detailed discussion of the MLDS theory, model fitting, and the relation to clinical data is included. Longitudinal DaTscan images as well as MDS-UPDRS motor scores are available for over 440 subjects from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI), and this data set will be used along with MLDS to create the PD progression models. Project Narrative How Parkinson's disease (PD) progresses is poorly understood. This research proposes to develop precise disease progression models for PD using machine-learning. These models will give greater insight into PD progression and also help assess PD therapy.",DaTscan-based Disease Progression Models for Early-stage Parkinson’s Disease,9698441,R01NS107328,"['Algorithms ', ' striatal ', ' Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Exhibits ', ' pallidum ', ' Globus Pallidus ', ' Goals ', ' Joints ', ' Laterality ', ' Handedness ', ' Math ', ' Mathematics ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Biological Models ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Parkinsons disease ', "" Parkinson's disease "", "" Parkinson's "", ' Parkinson ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' putamen ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Systems Theory ', ' Single-Photon Emission-Computed Radionuclide Tomography ', ' SPECT imaging ', ' SPECT ', ' single photon emission computed tomography ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' DAT dopamine transporter ', ' dopamine transporter ', ' Glean ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' Left ', ' Anterior ', ' Clinical ', ' insight ', ' Bilateral ', ' Disease Progression ', ' uptake ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Pattern ', ' interest ', ' neuron loss ', ' neuronal loss ', ' neuronal death ', ' neuronal cell loss ', ' neuronal cell death ', ' neuron death ', ' neuron cell loss ', ' neuron cell death ', ' nerve cell loss ', ' nerve cell death ', ' expectation ', ' Modeling ', ' model design ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Clinical Data ', ' research clinical testing ', ' clinical test ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke ', ' National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke ', ' NINDS ', ' Coupled ', ' Coupling ', ' presynaptic ', ' progression marker ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' dynamic system ', ' dynamical system ', ' disease heterogeneity ', ' ']",NINDS,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,353562,CT-03,0.34990765003534413

"Speech markers of cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease ABSTRACT Dr. Kara Smith is a Movement Disorders neurologist at the University of Massachusetts Medical School (UMMS) whose goal is to become an independent investigator focused on early cognitive impairment in Parkinson disease (PD). Her long-term goal is to develop speech markers of cognitive impairment in PD. Cognitive impairment occurs in the majority of PD patients, leading to increased mortality and decreased quality of life. The current diagnostic tools are resource-intensive and have limited sensitivity. Treatments are often offered late in the course of cognitive decline and do not provide optimal benefit. Speech markers could improve detection, monitoring and treatment of cognitive impairment in PD. Speech markers could be monitored frequently and remotely via mobile technology, capturing sensitive, quantitative data about cognitive function in the context of patients’ daily life and in response to therapeutics. Dr. Smith’s role as a clinical movement disorders specialist ideally positions her to lead the application of advanced speech and language research to feasible, patient-oriented tools for real-life clinical practice and clinical trials. Dr. Smith has assembled an expert interdisciplinary mentorship team ideally suited for the goals of this innovative proposal. Dr. Smith and her team have previously shown that a) speech acoustic markers are associated with cognitive function in non-demented PD patients, and b) PD patients with mild cognitive impairment had linguistic deficits including pauses within utterances and grammaticality. Building on these results, Dr. Smith proposes to study speech and language more comprehensively in PD patients with and without mild cognitive impairment and controls to confirm these preliminary results and identify additional biomarkers. The aims of this study will be 1) to develop algorithms using speech acoustic markers to categorize by cognitive status, 2) to identify linguistic markers associated with mild cognitive impairment in PD, and 3) to assess on-line syntactic processing in PD subjects with mild cognitive impairment. The overall goal of the proposal is to identify speech and language markers of early cognitive dysfunction that can be further refined, validated and implemented using mobile technology into a larger scale, longitudinal R01 proposal. Further work will also address the underlying neurobiological mechanisms of these speech markers. Dr. Smith’s rigorous training plan includes a Master’s degree, linguistics and speech motor physiology courses, and experience in signal processing and speech acoustic analysis. Through her training goals, she will advance her knowledge and skills in patient-centered outcomes measures and instrument validation. She will gain experience in research leadership, presentation and dissemination of scientific work, and in grant writing, culminating in an R01 proposal. This K23 award will be critical for Dr. Smith to establish an independent career as a PD clinician-scientist at the unique intersection of speech and language science and cognitive impairment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Speech markers have the potential to improve diagnosis, monitoring and treatment of cognitive impairment in Parkinson’s disease (PD). Although the majority of PD patients will develop cognitive impairment, the tools available to assess and treat this disabling complication are fraught with limitations. As a detailed and quantitative assessment tool, speech markers may increase sensitivity to early cognitive dysfunction and to changes over time compared with current measures. They may be automated and then implemented through mobile technology to increase patients’ access to cognitive symptom monitoring outside of the clinic setting. Dr. Smith’s proposed career development plan has potential to fill a major gap in PD research by making inexpensive and easy-to-use cognitive assessment tools accessible to patients in rural and international settings, and by fueling clinical trials to discover new therapeutics capable of slowing cognitive decline in PD.",Speech markers of cognitive impairment in Parkinson's

"Reinforcement Learning for Closed-Loop Deep Brain Stimulation ABSTRACT Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, affecting 1 in 100 people over the age of 60, and more than 5 million people worldwide. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has emerged as an effective treatment for the motor signs of PD. However, DBS is often limited by partial efficacy, side effects, and long and difficult clinical visits to identify and program therapeutic stimulation settings. Additionally, PD symptoms fluctuate from moment-to-moment depending on a multitude of factors, and therefore the demand for stimulation (or medication) changes throughout the day. There is a clear need for automated, individualized DBS programming strategies that can both reduce programming time and adapt to deliver optimal stimuli as each patient's symptoms fluctuate. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to improve the quality of life for PD patients by providing them with an intelligent, adaptive, closed-loop DBS algorithm. In Aim 1, we propose to create a closed-loop DBS algorithm in silico that can learn from and adapt to electro-physiological signatures of parkinsonian states in order to deliver optimal, patient- specific stimulation. The algorithm will be built upon the framework of reinforcement learning, which has several desirable properties that make it ideally suited for use in a closed-loop DBS algorithm. Given a biomarker for parkinsonian severity and a set of possible actions, the algorithm will autonomously learn how to deliver stimulus to reduce the biomarker and therefore PD symptoms. Preliminary results shown in this proposal suggest that the algorithm is able to learn complex actions without a priori knowledge, and can help to control a selected biomarker. In Aim 2, we propose to test out the algorithm in a large animal model of PD with high-density DBS arrays that have been shown to enable more advanced current steering and higher resolution local field potential recordings. We will then apply the algorithm and compare its performance to continuous DBS in terms of effects on individual parkinsonian motor signs as well as the electrophysiological signal targeted by the algorithm. This project will not only provide a means to critically evaluate putative biomarkers of DBS therapy for alleviating parkinsonian motor signs, but also provide a much more versatile and powerful closed-loop algorithm for use in titrating DBS therapy for individuals with Parkinson's disease and other neurological disorders amenable to deep brain stimulation therapy. As a result of this project, we will create a closed-loop DBS algorithm that can help improve the quality of life for Parkinson's disease patients. NARRATIVE Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects 1 in 100 people over the age of 60, and while dopamine replacement medication is well established for alleviating many of the motor symptoms of PD, but deep brain stimulation (DBS) is often indicated, in conjunction with medication as the disease progresses. One of the significant challenges with DBS is patient-specific dosimetry of stimulation settings to efficiently achieve a strong and consistent therapeutic effect. This project will develop an innovative reinforcement learning algorithm that autonomously learns which stimulation settings are most effective at reducing parkinsonian motor signs based on closed-loop feedback of oscillatory activity within the subthalamic nucleus and globus pallidus using high-density electrode arrays.",Reinforcement Learning for Closed-Loop Deep Brain

"The Gut Microbiome in Parkinson Disease Project Summary/Abstract This is a first R01 application from an early stage, new investigator and current NIEHS K01 awardee. Parkinson disease (PD) is a disabling neurodegenerative disease for which there is no cure. Years before the diagnosis of PD and the onset of motor symptoms, PD patients develop non-motor symptoms, including, importantly, constipation and gastrointestinal dysfunction. Constipation affects over 80% of PD patients and is one of the strongest risk factors for PD. Recent research shows that the enteric nervous system in the gut and the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve which anatomically links the GI system to the brain, are among the first and most severely affected by alpha-synuclein pathology characteristic of PD5 leading to the hypothesis that the gastrointestinal tract might be the site of initiation of PD. We propose to conduct a comprehensive investigation of the relation between human gut microbiome and PD, focusing on the pre- onset microbiome. We will do this by building on an ongoing Department of Defense funded project that has identified participants with pre-parkinson syndrome (PPS - defined as the co- occurrence of constipation, pRBD (probable rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder) and hyposmia) that in a pilot study has been associated with a ~200 fold increase in PD risk. Studying the microbiome among this group, who are highly likely to develop PD or are already in the premotor state, will give us a unique look at the microbiome in PD patients prior to any potential disease-associated effects of changes in diet and lifestyle that may have confounded prior case-control studies. The proposed study will take advantage of 25 years of prospectively collected data on environmental and dietary exposures and disease outcomes in two prospective cohorts of men and women. Project Narrative Our appreciation of the impact of the gut microbiome on brain health, and especially PD, is in the early stages. This study will be the first to examine the gut microbiome in participants with premotor PD and compare it to healthy controls, controls with constipation and to recently onset PD cases. This project will thus advance our understanding of how the human gut microbiome contributes to the pathophysiology of PD and will contribute to the development of tools needed for a preclinical diagnosis and/or treatment.",The Gut Microbiome in Parkinson Disease,9606513,R01NS097723,"['Affect ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic

"Environment, Metabolomics, and PD Project Abstract Our PEG study is among the largest Parkinson's disease (PD) population-based study with exceptional high-quality disease characterization and in-depth exposure assessment. Patients are diagnosed and examined (multiple times) by a UCLA movement disorder specialist. We developed a longitudinal geographic information system (GIS) based assessment for pesticide exposures that links state-mandated information on type, date, and location of all agricultural pesticide applications in California recorded since 1974 to land use maps and study participants' residences and work places. Here we propose to combine a powerful new metabolomics tool and system biology analytic methods to identify signatures for toxic exposures that evoke long-term biologic responses. The metabolomics data we will generate will help us identify metabolic profiles for chronic environmental exposures for both PD patients and population controls. This will generate a first understanding of the metabolic consequences of chronic low dose pesticide exposure in PD. However, biologic processes, including biologic responses to chronic toxicant exposures and those involved in disease development, are highly dynamic and interactive systems. The PEG study is uniquely capable to begin investigating these multidimensional networks linking exposure and disease. We have already generated genome and epigenome profiles for 550 PD patients and 250 controls. Here we newly propose to generate and analyze serum based metabolome profiles (targeted and untargeted) for these same 800 study participants characterizing environmental pesticide exposures via metabolome wide association analyses. We aim to develop a metabolite signature of environmental exposure using supervised machine learning methods, and also determine if these are disease specific or found in both exposed cases and controls. Furthermore, incorporating our genome and epigenome information, we propose to use biological systems analysis to identify multi-omics network patterns that distinguish environmental exposures that contribute to PD onset and progression. We expect this to show a chronic response pattern across different molecular layers and are influenced by many environmental factors. Combining multi-omic measures based on multidimensional network and system analyses will address the gaps in our current knowledge concerning molecular mechanisms responsible for the effects of chronic low dose exposures in PD. Project Narrative Here we propose to build upon a unique resource - the PEG population-based Parkinson's disease (PD) study - to identify metabolic signatures of chronic environmental exposures and disease in 550 PD patients and 250 population controls. Importantly, we plan to integrate exposure and effect markers across multiple molecular layers (genome, epigenome, metabolome), with the goal to obtain a more holistic understanding of molecular changes due to chronic environmental exposures. Our approach incorporates multi-omics measures and multidimensional network and system analyses to address gaps in our current knowledge concerning molecular mechanisms responsible for the effects of chronic low dose exposures in PD.","Environment, Metabolomics, and PD",9652630,R21ES030175,"['Address ', ' Dose ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Data ', ' Metabolic Pathway ', ' metabolomics ', '

"Mid-frontal delta/theta rhythms and cognitive control in PD Abstract Up to 80% of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) will suffer from cognitive symptoms, including impaired attention, planning, reasoning and working memory as well as hallucinations, visuospatial dysfunction, and delusions. These impairments lead to mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) and dementia (PDD) in PD. Cognitive symptoms of PD are associated with enormous cost to our society. There are no clear biomarkers and few effective treatments for PD-MCI/PDD. Because risk for PD increases dramatically with age, this problem will surge as our population grows older. The mechanisms contributing to PD-MCI/PDD are unknown. Our group has found that low-frequency (1-8 Hz; or delta/theta bands) brain rhythms might be helpful in diagnosing cognitive dysfunction in PD. This delta/theta activity originates from areas of medial frontal cortex such as the anterior cingulate, and is detectable by mid-frontal scalp EEG electrodes. We have found that mid-frontal delta/theta brain rhythms are engaged when healthy individuals detect novelty, errors, and conflict, or make decisions. These rhythms are attenuated in PD patients. Our working model is that PD patients manifest diverse neuronal and network deficits that impair mid-frontal delta/theta activity, leading to failures in engaging cognitive control. These abnormalities contribute to PD-MCI and PDD. In this proposal we combine `big-data' machine learning tools, intraoperative neurophysiology in humans, and new brain-stimulation paradigms to investigate the role of mid-frontal delta/theta rhythms in PD. We will test the overall hypothesis that mid-frontal delta/theta impairments are a mechanism of cognitive dysfunction in PD. In Aim 1 we will determine if mid-frontal delta/theta activity predicts PD-MCI/PDD. In Aim 2 we will use unique intraoperative recordings to determine how delta/theta activity within medial frontal cortex influences neurons in the subthalamic nucleus, a key site of functional convergence that is targeted by current deep-brain stimulation for PD. Notably, the subthalamic nucleus is a compact structure that receives highly overlapping input from cognitive and motor cortical regions, making it likely that our recordings will capture cognitive processing within this nucleus. Finally, in Aim 3 we will determine if subthalamic nucleus deep-brain stimulation at delta/theta frequencies improves cognitive control in PD patients. Because these experiments involve recordings across several PD patient populations (Aim 1), from single subthalamic neurons (Aim 2), and brain stimulation (Aim 3), each of these aims will provide independent mechanistic insight into cognitive dysfunction in PD. PD is a complex disease, but if cortical EEG abnormalities are a consistent theme it might inspire new diagnostic tools or new brain-stimulation therapies for cognitive dysfunction in PD. Results from this proposal could also be important for other neurodegenerative diseases such as dementia with Lewy bodies and Alzheimer's disease.     Public Health Relevance Cognitive symptoms of Parkinson's disease are an enormous public health problem. Here, we will ana- lyze brain rhythms that are involved in cognitive processing and also dysfunctional in Parkinson's dis- ease. We will use these brain rhythms to guide novel brain stimulation that has the potential to treat dementia and cognitive impairments in Parkinson's disease.  ",Mid-frontal delta/theta rhythms and

"Towards Generating a Multimodal and Multivariate Classification Model from Imaging and Non-Imaging Measures for Accurate Diagnosis and Monitoring of Dementia in Parkinsons disease. PROJECT SUMMARY The goal of the proposed research is to identify the best predictive biomarkers of dementia in Parkinson’s disease (PDD) through a multimodal and multivariate statistical model utilizing both neuroimaging derived measures (diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI), resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI), and T1-weighted MRI measures) and non- imaging measures such as demographics (age, sex, years of education), clinical (disease duration and severity), genetics (LRRK2), and CSF-measures (Total Tau, β-Amyloid, α-synuclein). It is critical to identify biomarkers that can predict dementia in Parkinson’s disease (PD) as approximately 50-80% of PD patients develop PDD within twelve years of diagnosis. Identifying pathophysiology-based biomarkers that could identify PD patients at high risk for PDD reliably is critical for better prognostication, correct identification of PDD in its prodromal stage to recruit in new disease-modifying clinical trials, and better understanding the pathophysiological processes underlining PDD. The proposed project has two important components. The first component of the project is to understand the pathophysiological mechanism underlying PDD through sophisticated voxelwise dMRI-derived measures estimated using a multi-shell high angular and spatial resolution dMRI data acquisition, and understanding network-level white matter (WM)-derived structural connectivity and rsfMRI-derived functional connectivity in PDD. The second component of the project is to identify the biomarkers that predict PDD through multivariate statistical modelling by combining these sophisticated pathologically relevant neuroimaging measures with non-imaging measures (such as clinical, demographics, genetics, and CSF-measures). We will recruit demographically matched healthy controls (HC) along with demographically, disease duration, and disease severity matched PD patients with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI), PD-non-MCI (PD-nMCI), and PDD for this project. We will acquire multi-shell dMRI data at three b-values, namely 500s/mm2, 1000s/mm2, and 2500s/mm2 with a high angular and spatial resolution and estimate various unbiased free-water (fiso) corrected Gaussian dMRI-derived measures along with non-Gaussian dMRI-derived measures such as diffusion kurtosis measures, and neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging measures. We will further compare these measures between the groups to identify significant dMRI-derived measures separating the groups, and understanding the neuroanatomical correlates of these measures with various neuropsychological scores. Furthermore, we will estimate dMRI-derived structural connectivity and rsfMRI-derived functional connectivity to understand network-level discrepancies predicting PDD. These pathologically relevant neuroimaging measures will be further combined with various non-imaging measures through a novel machine learning algorithm to identify the comprehensive and best predictors of PDD. The tools developed in our proposal also has great potential for significantly advancing the understanding of other neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) thereby helping to understand AD- and PD-specific neuroanatomical changes predicting dementia. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is highly relevant to public health because identification of the Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients at a high-risk for developing dementia (PDD) is critical for better prognostication, correct identification of PDD in its prodromal stage to recruit in new disease-modifying clinical trials, and to better understand the pathophysiological processes underlining PDD. The proposed project identifies the best predictive biomarkers for PDD through examining the comprehensive Gaussian and non-Gaussian diffusion-MRI (dMRI)-derived white matter (WM) changes predicting PDD, examining the network-level discrepancies predicting PDD derived from dMRI-derived whole-brain structural connectivity and resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI)-derived whole-brain functional connectivity, and developing a multivariate and multimodal statistical model by combining these sophisticated pathologically relevant neuroimaging measures with non-imaging measures such as clinical (disease duration and severity), demographics (age, sex, years of education), genetics (LRRK2), and CSF- measures (β-Amyloid, α-Synuclein, tau) to identify the best predictive biomarkers of PDD through machine learning approach. The machine learning algorithm developed in our proposal also has great potential for significantly advancing the understanding of other neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD)

"DBS Protocols for Long-Lasting Therapeutic Benefit in Mouse and Primate Models of Parkinson's Disease Abstract Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is one of the most effective treatments for patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD). Delivery of high frequency electrical stimulation to the subthalamic nucleus (STN) ameliorates parkinsonian motor symptoms, often within seconds, but therapeutic effects wear off quickly if stimulation is stopped, often within minutes. This transient nature of symptomatic relief underscores the fact that existing DBS protocols mask symptoms but do not alleviate underlying circuit dysfunction. A modified DBS protocol, called coordinated reset (CR-DBS), has shown potential to provide long-lasting therapeutic benefits for days to weeks after stimulation, but this protocol has been slow to translate into widespread clinical use because (1) the multi- site, pseudorandom stimulation patterns required to implement it cannot be delivered with existing devices and (2) its mechanisms of action remain obscure, hindering insights into what parameters of CR-DBS should be tuned to ensure engagement of long-lasting effects. Recently, in a mouse model of PD, we discovered a cellular- based strategy to induce long-lasting motor recovery, by using optogenetics to target interventions to specific neuronal subpopulations in the external globus pallidus (GPe), an anatomical neighbor of the STN. Long-lasting motor rescue was induced by interventions that simultaneously increased the firing rates of GPe neurons enriched in parvalbumin (PV-GPe) and decreased the firing rates of GPe neurons enriched in lim homeobox 6 (Lhx6-GPe). Interestingly, at the physiological level, these cell-type specific interventions in the GPe converged upon a similar mechanism as CR-DBS, by ameliorating pathological patterns of neural activity in basal ganglia output nuclei that have been associated with parkinsonian motor deficits. This proposal will use knowledge gained from our discovery of long-lasting rescue through cell-type directed interventions in GPe to guide rational design and interrogation of human-applicable forms of DBS that may yield similarly long-lasting therapeutic benefit. Our experiments will test a novel, mechanistic hypothesis, based on supporting preliminary data, that the pattern of electrical DBS can be tuned to drive cell-type specific responses in the GPe that mirror those previously found to be sufficient to induce of long-lasting motor rescue with optogenetics. Experiments in Aim 1 will investigate the cellular mechanisms through which phasic stimulation in the STN evokes cell-type specific responses in the GPe (Aim 1.1) and use a machine learning approach to identify stimulation protocols that maximize this cell-type specific response (Aim 1.2). Experiments in Aim 2 will test the therapeutic efficacy of phasic stimulation protocols compared to conventional DBS, using behavioral and physiological assays in mouse (Aim 2.1) and primate (Aim 2.2) models of PD. Taken together, these experiments will advance our understanding of the fundamental differences between how conventional vs. phasic stimulation impacts the nervous system, with cell-type specific and synapse-specific resolution, and could provide novel therapeutic strategies that can be rapidly translated into humans. Project Narrative Conventional DBS is an effective therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD), but its therapeutic effects decay rapidly once stimulation is turned off, underscoring the fact that it masks symptoms but does not reverse underlying circuit dysfunction. Based on foundational research into the cell-type organization of basal ganglia circuits, this proposal develops and tests the therapeutic efficacy of electrical stimulation protocols designed to selectively recruit therapeutic cell populations within the external globus pallidus (GPe) of the basal ganglia. The collaborative project will test the efficacy and therapeutic duration of novel stimulation protocols in mouse and primate models of PD.",DBS Protocols for Long-Lasting Therapeutic Benefit in Mouse and Primate Models of Parkinson's Disease,9996149,R01NS117058,"['Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Basal Ganglia ', ' Basal Nuclei ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Dopamine ', ' Hydroxytyramine ', ' Electric Stimulation ', ' Electrical Stimulation ', ' electrostimulation ', ' Foundations ', ' Globus Pallidus ', ' pallidum ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Maps ', ' Masks ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Nervous system structure ', ' Nervous System ', ' Neurologic Body System ', ' Neurologic Organ System ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Parkinson ', "" Parkinson's disease "", ' Parkinsons disease ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Parvalbumins ', ' Patients ', ' Physiology ', ' Primates ', ' Primates Mammals ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Homeo Boxes ', ' Homeobox ', ' Mediating ', ' Nucleus Subthalamicus ', ' Subthalamic Nucleus ', ' Structure of subthalamic nucleus ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Acute ', ' Solid ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Ensure ', ' insight ', ' non-human primate ', ' nonhuman primate ', ' Parkinsonian ', ' Parkinsonian Condition ', ' Parkinsonian Diseases ', ' Parkinsonian Syndrome ', ' Parkinsonism ', ' Parkinsonian Disorders ', ' Whole-Cell Recordings ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Deep Brain Stimulation ', ' Hour ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' extracellular ', ' neural control ', ' neural regulation ', ' neuromodulation ', ' neuromodulatory ', ' neuroregulation ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' attenuation ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' motor deficit ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' therapeutic testing ', ' therapeutic evaluation ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Slice ', ' Pathologic ', ' Therapeutic Effect ', ' Behavioral ', ' Output ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' cost ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' clinical applicability ', ' clinical application ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' murine model ', ' mouse model ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' neural patterning ', ' subthalamic nucleus stimulation ', ' STN stimulation ', ' efficacy testing ', ' optogenetics ', ' motor recovery ', ' alleviate symptom ', ' ameliorating symptom ', ' decrease symptom ', ' fewer symptoms ', ' relieves symptoms ', ' symptom alleviation ', ' symptom reduction ', ' symptom relief ', ' reduce symptoms ', ' motor symptom ', ' translation to humans ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' high dimensionality ', ' recruit ', ' side effect ', ' ']",NINDS,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,641051,PA-18,0.10027572517461349
"Mid-frontal delta/theta rhythms and cognitive control in PD Abstract Up to 80% of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) will suffer from cognitive symptoms, including impaired attention, planning, reasoning and working memory as well as hallucinations, visuospatial dysfunction, and delusions. These impairments lead to mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) and dementia (PDD) in PD. Cognitive symptoms of PD are associated with enormous cost to our society. There are no clear biomarkers and few effective treatments for PD-MCI/PDD. Because risk for PD increases dramatically with age, this problem will surge as our population grows older. The mechanisms contributing to PD-MCI/PDD are unknown. Our group has found that low-frequency (1-8 Hz; or delta/theta bands) brain rhythms might be helpful in diagnosing cognitive dysfunction in PD. This delta/theta activity originates from areas of medial frontal cortex such as the anterior cingulate, and is detectable by mid-frontal scalp EEG electrodes. We have found that mid-frontal delta/theta brain rhythms are engaged when healthy individuals detect novelty, errors, and conflict, or make decisions. These rhythms are attenuated in PD patients. Our working model is that PD patients manifest diverse neuronal and network deficits that impair mid-frontal delta/theta activity, leading to failures in engaging cognitive control. These abnormalities contribute to PD-MCI and PDD. In this proposal we combine `big-data' machine learning tools, intraoperative neurophysiology in humans, and new brain-stimulation paradigms to investigate the role of mid-frontal delta/theta rhythms in PD. We will test the overall hypothesis that mid-frontal delta/theta impairments are a mechanism of cognitive dysfunction in PD. In Aim 1 we will determine if mid-frontal delta/theta activity predicts PD-MCI/PDD. In Aim 2 we will use unique intraoperative recordings to determine how delta/theta activity within medial frontal cortex influences neurons in the subthalamic nucleus, a key site of functional convergence that is targeted by current deep-brain stimulation for PD. Notably, the subthalamic nucleus is a compact structure that receives highly overlapping input from cognitive and motor cortical regions, making it likely that our recordings will capture cognitive processing within this nucleus. Finally, in Aim 3 we will determine if subthalamic nucleus deep-brain stimulation at delta/theta frequencies improves cognitive control in PD patients. Because these experiments involve recordings across several PD patient populations (Aim 1), from single subthalamic neurons (Aim 2), and brain stimulation (Aim 3), each of these aims will provide independent mechanistic insight into cognitive dysfunction in PD. PD is a complex disease, but if cortical EEG abnormalities are a consistent theme it might inspire new diagnostic tools or new brain-stimulation therapies for cognitive dysfunction in PD. Results from this proposal could also be important for other neurodegenerative diseases such as dementia with Lewy bodies and Alzheimer's disease.     Public Health Relevance Cognitive symptoms of Parkinson's disease are an enormous public health problem. Here, we will ana- lyze brain rhythms that are involved in cognitive processing and also dysfunctional in Parkinson's dis- ease. We will use these brain rhythms to guide novel brain stimulation that has the potential to treat dementia and cognitive impairments in Parkinson's disease.  ",Mid-frontal delta/theta rhythms and

"Environment, Metabolomics, and PD Project Abstract Our PEG study is among the largest Parkinson's disease (PD) population-based study with exceptional high-quality disease characterization and in-depth exposure assessment. Patients are diagnosed and examined (multiple times) by a UCLA movement disorder specialist. We developed a longitudinal geographic information system (GIS) based assessment for pesticide exposures that links state-mandated information on type, date, and location of all agricultural pesticide applications in California recorded since 1974 to land use maps and study participants' residences and work places. Here we propose to combine a powerful new metabolomics tool and system biology analytic methods to identify signatures for toxic exposures that evoke long-term biologic responses. The metabolomics data we will generate will help us identify metabolic profiles for chronic environmental exposures for both PD patients and population controls. This will generate a first understanding of the metabolic consequences of chronic low dose pesticide exposure in PD. However, biologic processes, including biologic responses to chronic toxicant exposures and those involved in disease development, are highly dynamic and interactive systems. The PEG study is uniquely capable to begin investigating these multidimensional networks linking exposure and disease. We have already generated genome and epigenome profiles for 550 PD patients and 250 controls. Here we newly propose to generate and analyze serum based metabolome profiles (targeted and untargeted) for these same 800 study participants characterizing environmental pesticide exposures via metabolome wide association analyses. We aim to develop a metabolite signature of environmental exposure using supervised machine learning methods, and also determine if these are disease specific or found in both exposed cases and controls. Furthermore, incorporating our genome and epigenome information, we propose to use biological systems analysis to identify multi-omics network patterns that distinguish environmental exposures that contribute to PD onset and progression. We expect this to show a chronic response pattern across different molecular layers and are influenced by many environmental factors. Combining multi-omic measures based on multidimensional network and system analyses will address the gaps in our current knowledge concerning molecular mechanisms responsible for the effects of chronic low dose exposures in PD. Project Narrative Here we propose to build upon a unique resource - the PEG population-based Parkinson's disease (PD) study - to identify metabolic signatures of chronic environmental exposures and disease in 550 PD patients and 250 population controls. Importantly, we plan to integrate exposure and effect markers across multiple molecular layers (genome, epigenome, metabolome), with the goal to obtain a more holistic understanding of molecular changes due to chronic environmental exposures. Our approach incorporates multi-omics measures and multidimensional network and system analyses to address gaps in our current knowledge concerning molecular mechanisms responsible for the effects of chronic low dose exposures in PD.","Environment, Metabolomics, and PD",9858332,R21ES030175,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Anions ', ' Archives ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', '

"CRCNS: Deep Neural Network Approaches for Closed-Loop Deep Brain Stimulation The discovery that aberrant synchronization of rhythmic neuronal activity recorded in PD patients is suppressed by DBS has advanced the concept that measures associated with pathological activity may be used as biomarkers to control the delivery of DBS therapy. Pilot studies of aDBS in PD have reported promising clinical results from triggering DBS stimulation when the signal recorded from the DBS electrode showed a high level of oscillatory power in the beta frequency range (13 – 35 Hz). That approach, however, has important limitations. Most importantly, beta power recorded from the DBS lead is suppressed by movement including PD tremor, its detection is highly dependent on lead location and the recording montage needed to record during stimulation is incompatible with directional current steering, a recent innovation employing segmented stimulation contacts. The inherent complexity of the increased parameter space through DBS innovations also overwhelms standard programming techniques. Finally, use of additional biomarker signals (e.g., recorded from cortex) is likely to improve the ability to adaptively control DBS for disorders marked by complex multidimensional symptomatologies such as PD. The current proposal will establish methods for overcoming these limitations by developing techniques for multi-feature classification from ECoG recordings, using advanced machine learning algorithms. The proposed research builds upon the extensive and unique experiences with multi-day, extra-operative recording from DBS leads in patients at Charité Hospital and intraoperative ECoG and DBS recording from patients at the University of Pittsburgh, in order to develop computational methods to advance closed-loop, adaptive DBS (aDBS) strategies for movement disorders. This research seeks to improve computational methods for interpreting brain signals recorded from patients undergoing deep brain stimulation for Parkinson’s disease. The results may inform the design of novel strategies for biomarker-responsive brain stimulation.",CRCNS: Deep Neural Network Approaches for Closed-Loop Deep Brain Stimulation,10025184,R01NS110424,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Basal Ganglia ', ' Basal Nuclei ', ' Behavior ', ' Berlin ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Data Collection ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electrodes ', ' Environment ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Evolution ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Joints ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Maps ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Movement Disorders ', ' Dyskinesia Syndromes ', ' Movement Disorder Syndromes ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurosciences ', ' neurosurgery ', ' Noise ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Parkinson ', "" Parkinson's disease "", ' Parkinsons disease ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Patients ', ' Periodicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tremor ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' Bradykinesia ', ' Parkinsonian ', ' Parkinsonian Condition ', ' Parkinsonian Diseases ', ' Parkinsonian Syndrome ', ' Parkinsonism ', ' Parkinsonian Disorders ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Deep Brain Stimulation ', ' Investigation ', ' electrocorticography ', ' Electrocorticogram ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Location ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Brain region ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Validation ', ' Pathologic ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' reconstruction ', ' computational framework ', ' computer framework ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' Implant ', ' implantation ', ' remote sensor ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' translational neuroscience ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' symptomatology ', ' alleviate symptom ', ' ameliorating symptom ', ' decrease symptom ', ' fewer symptoms ', ' relieves symptoms ', ' symptom alleviation ', ' symptom reduction ', ' symptom relief ', ' reduce symptoms ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep neural network ', ' artificial neural net ', ' computational neural network ', ' synthetic neural network ', ' artificial neural network ', ' deep learning ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' smart algorithm ', ' intelligent algorithm ', ' motor behavior ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,221735,MA-08,0.17477911422624745
"Advancing personalized medicine in PD using harmonized multi-site clinical data Project Summary Among neurological disorders, the fastest growing is now Parkinson's disease (PD), surpassing Alzheimer's dis- ease. PD manifests as a heterogeneous clinical syndrome and this variability in the clinical phenotype highlights the need to tailor the type and/or the dosage of treatment to the speciﬁc and changing needs of individuals living with PD. The main goal of individualized, or precision, medicine is to use patient characteristics to determine an individualized treatment strategy (ITS) to promote wellness. Due to the complex nature of PD coupled with phenotypic heterogeneity, formulating successful individualized approaches to medical care is a complex prob- lem that may beneﬁt from a more data-driven approach. One of the challenges in developing reliable ITSs is that the analyses require studies with fairly large sample sizes and longitudinal assessment of subjects over a relatively long period of time. The data set must also include various prescribing patterns to allow the analytic method to learn the effects of different treatment sequences (strategies). These important requirements preclude investigators from using data from a single clinical study to construct data-driven ITSs. Existing guidelines for symptomatic drug therapy for PD can best be described as ""permissive"". The relative lack of comparative evidence for different classes of drugs has created challenges in devising recommendations to follow any speciﬁc therapeutic strategy. We ﬁll this important gap by proposing a two phase study. The ﬁrst phase (R61) focuses on creating a harmonized and curated dataset by integrating data from six clinical trials and the PPMI observational study that, in aggregate, involved 4,705 patients followed from 23.5 to 96 months. To the best of our knowledge, such comprehensive data harmonization has not been done before in PD and it can provide an excellent source of information for future studies as well. In the second phase (R33), we will leverage the harmonized data set to develop high quality ITSs for PD with respect to several clinical outcomes including UPDRS score, quality of life, and Schwab and England (SE) ADL measured at 24 and 48 months of follow-up. Speciﬁcally, the goals of the R33 phase are to (Aim 1) compare commonly used sequences of drug classes for PD; (Aim 2) identify the best individualized treatment strategies to inform optimal sequences of drug classes for PD. In pursuit of these aims, we will propose robust, rigorous and computationally efﬁcient statistical machine learning methods for constructing data-driven optimal ITSs for PD. The proposal expands the scope of existing methods in developing ITSs by relaxing certain unrealistic assumptions and through the use of ﬂexible modeling techniques (e.g., machine learning methods) while maintaining valid statistical inference. These new methods will be integrated into easy-to-use, publicly available software in the R language (Aim 3). This will maximize the adoption of the proposed methodology by other investigators and allow researchers to analyze other PD datasets with a goal of constructing an ITS for PD. Furthermore, because the methods are not disease-speciﬁc, our methods and software will enable similar exploration for other diseases. Project Narrative Constructing reliable individualized treatment strategies requires studies with fairly large sample sizes with longi- tudinal assessment of subjects over a relatively long period of time. To this end, we will create a harmonized and curated dataset by integrating data from seven long-term observational and randomized studies in Parkinson's disease. Using this harmonized data, we will develop and apply robust, rigorous and computationally efﬁcient methods for estimating an optimal individualized treatment strategy for Parkinson's disease with respect to var- ious outcomes (e.g., Uniﬁed Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, quality of life, and Schwab and England ADL score). We will also leverage statistical machine learning approaches to improve the quality of the constructed optimal individualized treatment strategy while providing valid statistical inference.",Advancing personalized medicine in PD using harmonized multi-site clinical data,10129639,R61NS120240,"['Adoption ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Behavior ', ' Clinic Visits ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Collection ', ' Decision Making ', ' Decision Trees ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' England ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Language ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Parkinson ', "" Parkinson's disease "", ' Parkinsons disease ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Syndrome ', ' Target Populations ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' Magazine ', ' Journals ', ' Guidelines ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' dosage ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Sample Size ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Complex ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' data management ', ' treatment planning ', ' Participant ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' depository ', ' repository ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Long-term Follow-up ', ' long-term followup ', ' longterm followup ', ' Longterm Follow-up ', ' Observation research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observational research ', ' Observational Study ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' Output ', ' clinical phenotype ', ' clinical site ', ' clinical research site ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Coupled ', ' open source ', ' comparative ', ' demographics ', ' clinical care ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' treatment response ', ' treatment strategy ', ' progression biomarker ', ' progression marker ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' precision medicine ', ' customized therapy ', ' customized treatment ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' individualized therapy ', ' individualized treatment ', ' patient specific therapies ', ' patient specific treatment ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' tailored therapy ', ' tailored treatment ', ' unique treatment ', ' individualized medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized medicine ', ' Personalized medical approach ', ' individualized approach ', ' precision approach ', ' tailored approach ', ' personalized approach ', ' longitudinal data set ', ' longitudinal dataset ', ' primary care provider ', ' care providers ', ' patient specific response ', ' responsive patient ', ' patient response ', ' over-treatment ', ' overtreatment ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' harmonized data ', ' data harmonization ', ' comparative effectiveness study ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R61,2020,514654,NY-25,0.3153004935943641
"Multi-tissue high-throughput proteomic and genomic study in Parkinson's Disease Project Summary/Abstract Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder, affecting more than 6 million people worldwide, with the prevalence projected to double in the next few decades. Despite the improvements in high-throughput genomics and proteomics that have significantly facilitated the advancement of biomarker discovery in other neurodegenerative diseases, there are no reliable biomarkers for PD. Currently, the PD diagnosis relies almost entirely on clinical examination. There are several reasons for the lack of reliable biomarkers in PD including most studies have been focused on single molecules in one tissue, small samples sizes and a lack of independent replication cohorts. To overcome these limitations, we propose leveraging a unique resource that includes quantitative proteomic analysis of ~1,300 proteins from CSF and plasma of clinically diagnosed PD patients coupled with validation in brain samples from autopsy-confirmed PD cases. We will pair the proteomic data with novel and powerful unbiased (hypothesis-free) genomic approaches to select the most plausible candidates for targeted replication studies. This large-scale screening of ~3,110 samples could identify biomarkers of known molecular pathways involving PD or with a clear genetic connection to PD risk. To achieve these goals, we propose three aims: Specific Aim 1: To identify proteins differentially expressed in PD patients in plasma, CSF or brain tissue. We plan to carry out a quantitative proteomic analysis using Somalogic SOMAscan® assay of plasma (n=600) and CSF (n=200) from clinically diagnosed PD patients and of brain tissue (n=200) from autopsy-confirmed PD patients. We will also evaluate CSF (n=740), plasma (n=410) and brain tissue (n=114) from an independent cohort of healthy individuals and CSF (n=275), plasma (n=234) and brain tissue (n=345) from AD patients. We expect to obtain precise and accurate levels of a large number of proteins across multiple tissues in the analyzed samples. Specific Aim 2: To prioritize candidate biomarkers based on an integrative analysis of proteomic and genome-wide genotyping data using Mendelian Randomization (MR). We plan to integrate proteomic and GWAS data to identify protein quantitative loci (pQTLs) and apply MR approaches to determine proteins involved in the causal pathway of PD. Using this approach, we will be able to select reliable PD biomarker candidates for validation. Specific Aim 3: To determine whether genetic and proteomic data improves biomarker specificity. We will ascertain whether combining proteomic and genomic data could increase biomarker accuracy. We expect to uncover a genome-proteome network that may provide a basis for novel approaches to diagnostic and pharmacotherapeutic applications in PD. Narrative Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorders in humans. Currently, there are no reliable, sensitive and specific biomarkers identified in PD to date.

"Comprehensive Multivariable Deep Learning Models to Identify Predictors of Cognitive Change in PD PROJECT SUMMARY Cognitive impairment and Parkinson’s disease dementia (PDD) are well-established disorders in Parkinson’s disease (PD) which are debilitating and contribute to increased mortality. The course, severity, and rate of progression of cognitive symptoms in PD is variable and unpredictable. Some patients develop PDD within the first several years of diagnosis, while others remain cognitively intact or have a milder form of impairment for many years after diagnosis. This heterogeneity in impairment profile and risk to PDD likely reflects the diverse underlying pathophysiological mechanisms associated with PD progression and cognitive dysfunction. The combination of diverse pathological features and clinical phenotypes makes it challenging to inform patients what to expect during the course of disease, and is a substantial barrier to developing new drugs for cognitive impairment in PD. Therefore, developing prognostic markers of risk of cognitive progression in PD is important. Our overall hypothesis is that different combinations of biomarkers will be more informative in predicting cognitive progression compared to a single biomarker alone. Thus, our objective is to investigate multivariable data to identify unique clinical-molecular-imaging biomarker signatures that identify individuals with PD who are most likely to experience substantial cognitive changes that ultimately lead to PDD. To achieve our objective, we will first develop deep learning models that identify multivariable features that are prognostic of incident mild cognitive impairment in people with early-stage PD (aim 1). Next, we will develop deep learning models that identify multivariable features that are prognostic of either (a) conversion from mild cognitive impairment to PDD (aim 2); or, (b) reversion from mild cognitive impairment to cognitively intact PD (aim 3). Finally, we will develop deep learning models that identify prognostic markers of rapid cognitive deterioration in PD leading to PDD (aim 4). For the development of the proposed models, this project will take advantage of a large repository of clinical data available at the Center for Health + Technology (CHeT) at the University of Rochester. The modeling will be carried out at the University of Rochester Data Science Consortium (RDSC) by an experienced team of data scientists that will use multimodal temporal convolution network models. A multidisciplinary team that includes neurologists, pharmacologists, and data scientists will support model execution and the interpretation of the modeling results. The expected outcomes of the efforts from this research are comprehensive multivariable prognostic markers of cognitive progression in PD across different stages of disease, from mild impairment to PDD that will add novel insight into disease process. NARRATIVE Deep learning will be used to construct models of cognitive progression in Parkinson’s disease (PD) from multiple data modalities. The models will assess and evaluate the potential impact of clinical, biosamples, genetics, and imaging variables on the progression to mild cognitive impairment and dementia, as well as on rates of cognitive progression. These models will identify markers and their combinations that are prognostic to distinct cognitive progression trajectories in PD.",Comprehensive Multivariable Deep Learning Models to Identify

"MRI Signatures of Neuromelanin and Iron Pathology in Parkinsonism Parkinson’s disease (PD), multiple system atrophy parkinsonian type (MSA-P), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) are costly and devastating neurodegenerative diseases. They have overlapping clinical manifestations and diagnosis remains challenging in many cases. Thus far no effective treatments have been developed to meaningfully slow or stop their progression. This is due in part to a lack of tools to objectively measure degeneration in the neural systems affected by each of these diseases. Availability of such tools would assist clinical diagnosis, facilitate selection of appropriate patient groups for trial recruitment, and enable objective measurement of treatment outcomes. Recent MRI studies suggest that disease-specific brain changes can, indeed, be identified in these parkinsonian diseases. The objective of this research is to identify univariable markers and multivariable MRI signatures that capture distinct patterns of neurodegenerative change across neural systems to accurately distinguish these diseases.  To accomplish this the investigators use 3 Tesla MRI contrasts sensitive to key features of neurodegeneration to 1) identify structures damaged by PD, MSA-P and PSP and 2) to quantify the extent of damage in each neural system in parkinsonian diseases. Specifically, the investigators use neuromelanin- sensitive MRI to measure neuromelanin loss and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) and R2* imaging to measure iron accumulation in patients with PD, MSA-P, and PSP. Using these contrasts and an innovative region of interest (ROI) selection approach, they reproducibly measure patterns of neurodegenerative change across neural systems. In Aim 1 the investigators use neuromelanin-sensitive MRI to study neuromelanin loss in PD, MSA-P and PSP in to identify univariable disease features that are differentially affected by parkinsonian diseases and may assist distinguishing these conditions. In Aim 2 they use QSM and R2* MRI to study ROIs differentially impacted by PD, MSA-P and PSP to identify iron accumulation biomarkers to help distinguish these diseases. In Aim 3 the investigators apply machine learning classification algorithms to identify multivariable MRI signatures of neurodegenerative change across neural systems to differentiate PD, MSA-P and PSP. Study outputs will be candidate MRI biomarkers and disease signatures. The long term goal of this research is to further develop these outputs for use as clinical diagnostic tools and as biomarkers for subject selection and outcome measurement in clinical trials.  Through this career award Dr. Huddleston will gain new skills in MRI methods, data science, and neural systems imaging in parkinsonian diseases. These new skills will enable Dr. Huddleston to design and lead interdisciplinary neuroimaging biomarker studies for Parkinson’s disease and related disorders. His mentor team is comprised of leaders in their fields. This team and the dynamic research environment at Emory University provide the necessary support for Dr. Huddleston to successfully transition to scientific independence. There is an urgent public health need for new treatments to slow or stop the progression of Parkinson’s disease, multiple system atrophy and progressive supranuclear palsy, and objective tools to distinguish these diseases for clinical and research purposes are lacking. The outputs of the proposed research will be candidate MRI biomarkers and multivariable MRI signatures to differentiate these conditions. These candidate biomarkers may be developed for use in clinical trial designs to increase their odds of success, and they may also assist clinical diagnosis.",MRI Signatures of Neuromelanin and Iron

"DaTscan-based Disease Progression Models for Early-stage Parkinson’s Disease Project Summary Parkinson's disease (PD) is heterogeneous: it has many subtypes and the disease progresses at different rates in different subtypes. Disease progression in early-stage PD is observed as signal changes in SPECT imaging with 123I-FP-CIT, which is called DaTscan imaging, or simply DaTscan. The goal of the research proposed here is to create accurate models of heterogeneous PD progression using DaTscan images. Such models will not only provide additional insight into PD, but they are also critically important in assessing the effect of neuro-protective therapy. A new set of models called mixtures of linear dynamical systems (MLDS) are proposed to model early-state PD progression as it manifests in DaTscans. MLDS models combine machine-learning methods with linear dynamical system theory. They capture many features of early-stage PD progression: laterality, non-linear progression, as well as PD heterogeneity. Preliminary results show that, MLDS is accurate, finds progression subtypes, relates well to clinical data (MDS-UPDRS motor scores), and gives genuinely new insights about PD progression. The proposed research aims to develop the MLDS methodology in region-of-interest as well as voxel-based frameworks. A detailed discussion of the MLDS theory, model fitting, and the relation to clinical data is included. Longitudinal DaTscan images as well as MDS-UPDRS motor scores are available for over 440 subjects from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI), and this data set will be used along with MLDS to create the PD progression models. Project Narrative How Parkinson's disease (PD) progresses is poorly understood. This research proposes to develop precise disease progression models for PD using machine-learning. These models will give greater insight into PD progression and also help assess PD therapy.",DaTscan-based Disease Progression Models for Early-stage Parkinson’s Disease,9902564,R01NS107328,"['Algorithms ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Striatum ', ' striatal ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Exhibits ', ' Globus Pallidus ', ' pallidum ', ' Goals ', ' Joints ', ' Handedness ', ' Laterality ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Parkinson ', "" Parkinson's disease "", ' Parkinsons disease ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' putamen ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Systems Theory ', ' single photon emission computed tomography ', ' SPECT ', ' SPECT imaging ', ' Single-Photon Emission-Computed Radionuclide Tomography ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' DAT dopamine transporter ', ' dopamine transporter ', ' Glean ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' Left ', ' Anterior ', ' Clinical ', ' insight ', ' Bilateral ', ' Disease Progression ', ' uptake ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Pattern ', ' interest ', ' nerve cell death ', ' nerve cell loss ', ' neuron cell death ', ' neuron cell loss ', ' neuron death ', ' neuronal cell death ', ' neuronal cell loss ', ' neuronal death ', ' neuronal loss ', ' neuron loss ', ' expectation ', ' Modeling ', ' model design ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' clinical test ', ' research clinical testing ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' NINDS ', ' National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke ', ' National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke ', ' Coupled ', ' Coupling ', ' presynaptic ', ' progression biomarker ', ' progression marker ', ' dynamical system ', ' dynamic system ', ' disease heterogeneity ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NINDS,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,353176,CT-03,0.34990765003534413
"AI2AMP-PD: Accelerating Parkinsons Diagnosis using Multi-omics and Artificial Intelligence AI2AMP-PD: Accelerating Parkinson’s Diagnosis using Multi-omics and Artificial Intelligence PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT Parkinson’s disease (PD) affects more than 7 million people worldwide, and biomarkers to bolster the therapeutic pipeline are urgently needed. Developing biomarkers for clinical use is a difficult process that requires evaluation of multiple, large cohorts, each adding confidence to the marker. The Accelerating Medicine Partnership in Parkinson’s disease (AMP PD) consortium provides an unparalleled opportunity to rapidly achieve this previously elusive goal.  We hypothesize that a powerful, multi-omics classifier powered by standard and advanced machine learning algorithms will accurately identify PD-associated biomarkers at genome scale. Transcripts and genomic classifiers associated with PD will be identified in early-stage, untreated, patients with Dopamine Transporter- neuroimaging-supported diagnosis represented in the PPMI cohort. Transcripts and genomic classifiers will be rigorously replicated in the independent PDBP and BioFIND cohorts. Multi-omics classifiers using both PD- associated transcriptome changes and PD-associated genomic variants will be built with state-of-the-art deep learning techniques (e.g. variational autoencoder).  This analysis will powerfully delineate --- for the first time --- the full spectrum of known and novel, coding and noncoding RNAs linked to PD and detectable in circulating blood cells in a harmonized, large-scale data set. It will develop and test highly innovative multi-omics classifiers and provide a generally useful computational framework for large-scale, unbiased PD biomarker discovery. Project Narrative These large-scale studies are relevant to public health for two reasons. First, they will reveal the biomarker genes whose dysregulation of expression level is associated with (and possibly causal of) early development of Parkinson’s disease. Secondly, the multi-omics, DNA-RNA predictive model built here based on large dataset and advanced deep learning methods will provide a computational framework for further biomarker development and early disease prediction.",AI2AMP-PD: Accelerating Parkinsons Diagnosis using Multi-omics and Artificial Intelligence,10157680,U01NS120637,"['Affect ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Blood Cells ', ' Peripheral Blood Cell ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Medicine ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Parkinson ', "" Parkinson's disease "", ' Parkinsons disease ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Enhancers ', ' DAT dopamine transporter ', ' dopamine transporter ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Severities ', ' Techniques ', ' cohort ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Motor ', ' Cognitive ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Transcript ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' computational framework ', ' computer framework ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' genome-wide ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' risk allele ', ' risk gene ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk loci ', ' risk locus ', ' risk variant ', ' screening ', ' differentially expressed ', ' transcriptional differences ', ' differential expression ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' learning strategy ', ' Data Analytics ', ' biomarker development ', ' multiomics ', ' multiple omics ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' transcriptome ', ' biomarker discovery ', ' genomic classifier ', ' genomic signature ', ' deep learning ', ' autoencoding neural network ', ' autoencoder ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' large scale data sets ', ' large scale datasets ', ' large scale data ', ' large data sets ', ' large datasets ', ' feature selection ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NINDS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,U01,2020,537000,MA-07,0.21892712500442982
"Speech markers of cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease ABSTRACT Dr. Kara Smith is a Movement Disorders neurologist at the University of Massachusetts Medical School (UMMS) whose goal is to become an independent investigator focused on early cognitive impairment in Parkinson disease (PD). Her long-term goal is to develop speech markers of cognitive impairment in PD. Cognitive impairment occurs in the majority of PD patients, leading to increased mortality and decreased quality of life. The current diagnostic tools are resource-intensive and have limited sensitivity. Treatments are often offered late in the course of cognitive decline and do not provide optimal benefit. Speech markers could improve detection, monitoring and treatment of cognitive impairment in PD. Speech markers could be monitored frequently and remotely via mobile technology, capturing sensitive, quantitative data about cognitive function in the context of patients’ daily life and in response to therapeutics. Dr. Smith’s role as a clinical movement disorders specialist ideally positions her to lead the application of advanced speech and language research to feasible, patient-oriented tools for real-life clinical practice and clinical trials. Dr. Smith has assembled an expert interdisciplinary mentorship team ideally suited for the goals of this innovative proposal. Dr. Smith and her team have previously shown that a) speech acoustic markers are associated with cognitive function in non-demented PD patients, and b) PD patients with mild cognitive impairment had linguistic deficits including pauses within utterances and grammaticality. Building on these results, Dr. Smith proposes to study speech and language more comprehensively in PD patients with and without mild cognitive impairment and controls to confirm these preliminary results and identify additional biomarkers. The aims of this study will be 1) to develop algorithms using speech acoustic markers to categorize by cognitive status, 2) to identify linguistic markers associated with mild cognitive impairment in PD, and 3) to assess on-line syntactic processing in PD subjects with mild cognitive impairment. The overall goal of the proposal is to identify speech and language markers of early cognitive dysfunction that can be further refined, validated and implemented using mobile technology into a larger scale, longitudinal R01 proposal. Further work will also address the underlying neurobiological mechanisms of these speech markers. Dr. Smith’s rigorous training plan includes a Master’s degree, linguistics and speech motor physiology courses, and experience in signal processing and speech acoustic analysis. Through her training goals, she will advance her knowledge and skills in patient-centered outcomes measures and instrument validation. She will gain experience in research leadership, presentation and dissemination of scientific work, and in grant writing, culminating in an R01 proposal. This K23 award will be critical for Dr. Smith to establish an independent career as a PD clinician-scientist at the unique intersection of speech and language science and cognitive impairment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Speech markers have the potential to improve diagnosis, monitoring and treatment of cognitive impairment in Parkinson’s disease (PD). Although the majority of PD patients will develop cognitive impairment, the tools available to assess and treat this disabling complication are fraught with limitations. As a detailed and quantitative assessment tool, speech markers may increase sensitivity to early cognitive dysfunction and to changes over time compared with current measures. They may be automated and then implemented through mobile technology to increase patients’ access to cognitive symptom monitoring outside of the clinic setting. Dr. Smith’s proposed career development plan has potential to fill a major gap in PD research by making inexpensive and easy-to-use cognitive assessment tools accessible to patients in rural and international settings, and by fueling clinical trials to discover new therapeutics capable of slowing cognitive decline in PD.",Speech markers of cognitive impairment in Parkinson's
